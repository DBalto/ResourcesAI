TITLE Second Best

RHYME a b b a c d c e d e

And has the truth brought no new hope at all,
Heart, that you're weeping yet for Paradise?
Do they still whisper, the old weary cries?
"'MID YOUTH AND SONG, FEASTING AND CARNIVAL,
THROUGH LAUGHTER, THROUGH THE ROSES, AS OF OLD
COMES DEATH, ON SHADOWY AND RELENTLESS FEET,
DEATH, UNAPPEASABLE BY PRAYER OR GOLD;
DEATH IS THE END, THE END!"
Proud, then, clear-eyed and laughing, go to greet
Death as a friend!

RHYME a a b c b c d e f d f e

Exile of immortality, strongly wise,
Strain through the dark with undesirous eyes
To what may lie beyond it.  Sets your star,
O heart, for ever!  Yet, behind the night,
Waits for the great unborn, somewhere afar,
Some white tremendous daybreak.  And the light,
Returning, shall give back the golden hours,
Ocean a windless level, Earth a lawn
Spacious and full of sunlit dancing-places,
And laughter, and music, and, among the flowers,
The gay child-hearts of men, and the child-faces
O heart, in the great dawn!

TITLE Day That I Have Loved

RHYME a b a b

Tenderly, day that I have loved, I close your eyes,
 And smooth your quiet brow, and fold your thin dead hands.
The grey veils of the half-light deepen; colour dies.
 I bear you, a light burden, to the shrouded sands,

RHYME a b a b

Where lies your waiting boat, by wreaths of the sea's making
 Mist-garlanded, with all grey weeds of the water crowned.
There you'll be laid, past fear of sleep or hope of waking;
 And over the unmoving sea, without a sound,

RHYME a b a b

Faint hands will row you outward, out beyond our sight,
 Us with stretched arms and empty eyes on the far-gleaming
And marble sand. . . . Beyond the shifting cold twilight,
 Further than laughter goes, or tears, further than dreaming,

RHYME a b a b

There'll be no port, no dawn-lit islands!  But the drear
 Waste darkening, and, at length, flame ultimate on the deep.
Oh, the last fire -- and you, unkissed, unfriended there!
 Oh, the lone way's red ending, and we not there to weep!

RHYME a b a b

(We found you pale and quiet, and strangely crowned with flowers,
 Lovely and secret as a child.  You came with us,
Came happily, hand in hand with the young dancing hours,
 High on the downs at dawn!)  Void now and tenebrous,

RHYME a b a b

The grey sands curve before From the inland meadows,
 Fragrant of June and clover, floats the dark, and fills
The hollow sea's dead face with little creeping shadows,
 And the white silence brims the hollow of the hills.

RHYME a b a b

Close in the nest is folded every weary wing,
 Hushed all the joyful voices; and we, who held you dear,
Eastward we turn and homeward, alone, remembering . . .
 Day that I loved, day that I loved, the Night is here!

TITLE Sleeping Out: Full Moon

RHYME a b b a c c d d e e

They sleep within. . . .
I cower to the earth, I waking, I only.
High and cold thou dreamest, O queen, high-dreaming and lonely.
We have slept too long, who can hardly win
The white one flame, and the night-long crying;
The viewless passers; the world's low sighing
With desire, with yearning,
To the fire unburning,
To the heatless fire, to the flameless ecstasy! . . .
Helpless I lie.

RHYME a a b c c b d e e d d e f e f

And around me the feet of thy watchers tread.
There is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head,
An intolerable radiance of wings. . . .
All the earth grows fire,
White lips of desire
Brushing cool on the forehead, croon slumbrous things.
Earth fades; and the air is thrilled with ways,
Dewy paths full of comfort.  And radiant bands,
The gracious presence of friendly hands,
Help the blind one, the glad one, who stumbles and strays,
Stretching wavering hands, up, up, through the praise
Of a myriad silver trumpets, through cries,
To all glory, to all gladness, to the infinite height,
To the gracious, the unmoving, the mother eyes,
And the laughter, and the lips, of light.

TITLE Pine-Trees and the Sky: Evening

RHYME a b a a b a b b a b b a

I'd watched the sorrow of the evening sky,
And smelt the sea, and earth, and the warm clover,
And heard the waves, and the seagull's mocking cry.
And in them all was only the old cry,
That song they always sing -- "The best is over!
You may remember now, and think, and sigh,
O silly lover!"
And I was tired and sick that all was over,
And because I,
For all my thinking, never could recover
One moment of the good hours that were over.
And I was sorry and sick, and wished to die.

RHYME a a b a a b a a

Then from the sad west turning wearily,
I saw the pines against the white north sky,
Very beautiful, and still, and bending over
Their sharp black heads against a quiet sky.
And there was peace in them; and I
Was happy, and forgot to play the lover,
And laughed, and did no longer wish to die;
Being glad of you, O pine-trees and the sky!

TITLE Wagner

RHYME a b a b c 
RHYME-POEM a b a b c

Creeps in half wanton, half asleep,
 One with a fat wide hairless face.
He likes love-music that is cheap;
 Likes women in a crowded place;
  And wants to hear the noise they're making.

RHYME a b a b c 
RHYME-POEM d e d e c

His heavy eyelids droop half-over,
 Great pouches swing beneath his eyes.
He listens, thinks himself the lover,
 Heaves from his stomach wheezy sighs;
  He likes to feel his heart's a-breaking.

RHYME a b a b c 
RHYME-POEM f g f g c

The music swells.  His gross legs quiver.
 His little lips are bright with slime.
The music swells.  The women shiver.
 And all the while, in perfect time,
  His pendulous stomach hangs a-shaking.

TITLE The Vision of the Archangels

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Slowly up silent peaks, the white edge of the world,
 Trod four archangels, clear against the unheeding sky,
Bearing, with quiet even steps, and great wings furled,
 A little dingy coffin; where a child must lie,
It was so tiny.  (Yet, you had fancied, God could never
 Have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight,
And shut him in that lonely shell, to drop for ever
 Into the emptiness and silence, into the night. . . .)

RHYME a b b a c c

They then from the sheer summit cast, and watched it fall,
 Through unknown glooms, that frail black coffin -- and therein
 God's little pitiful Body lying, worn and thin,
And curled up like some crumpled, lonely flower-petal --
Till it was no more visible; then turned again
With sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain.

TITLE Seaside

RHYME a b b a c d c d

Swiftly out from the friendly lilt of the band,
 The crowd's good laughter, the loved eyes of men,
 I am drawn nightward; I must turn again
Where, down beyond the low untrodden strand,
There curves and glimmers outward to the unknown
 The old unquiet ocean.  All the shade
Is rife with magic and movement.  I stray alone
 Here on the edge of silence, half afraid,

RHYME a b c b c a

Waiting a sign.  In the deep heart of me
The sullen waters swell towards the moon,
And all my tides set seaward. From inland
Leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tune,
That tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand,
And dies between the seawall and the sea.

TITLE On the Death of Smet-Smet, the Hippopotamus-Goddess

RHYME a a b b

She was wrinkled and huge and hideous?  She was our Mother.
She was lustful and lewd? -- but a God; we had none other.
In the day She was hidden and dumb, but at nightfall moaned in the shade;
We shuddered and gave Her Her will in the darkness; we were afraid.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

          She sent us pain,
           And we bowed before Her;
          She smiled again
           And bade us adore Her.
          She solaced our woe
           And soothed our sighing;
          And what shall we do
           Now God is dying?

RHYME a a b b

She was hungry and ate our children; -- how should we stay Her?
She took our young men and our maidens; -- ours to obey Her.
We were loathed and mocked and reviled of all nations; that was our pride.
She fed us, protected us, loved us, and killed us; now She has died.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

          She was so strong;
           But death is stronger.
          She ruled us long;
           But Time is longer.
          She solaced our woe
           And soothed our sighing;
          And what shall we do
           Now God is dying?

TITLE The Song of the Pilgrims

RHYME a a *

What light of unremembered skies
Hast thou relumed within our eyes,
Thou whom we seek, whom we shall find? . . .
A certain odour on the wind,
Thy hidden face beyond the west,
These things have called us; on a quest
Older than any road we trod,
More endless than desire.Far God,
Sigh with thy cruel voice, that fills
The soul with longing for dim hills
And faint horizons!  For there come
Grey moments of the antient dumb
Sickness of travel, when no song
Can cheer us; but the way seems long;
And one remembers  Ah! the beat
Of weary unreturning feet,
And songs of pilgrims unreturning! . . .
The fires we left are always burning
On the old shrines of home.  Our kin
Have built them temples, and therein
Pray to the Gods we know; and dwell
In little houses lovable,
Being happy (we remember how!)
And peaceful even to death O Thou,
God of all long desirous roaming,
Our hearts are sick of fruitless homing,
And crying after lost desire.
Hearten us onward! as with fire
Consuming dreams of other bliss.
The best Thou givest, giving this
Sufficient thing -- to travel still
Over the plain, beyond the hill,
Unhesitating through the shade,
Amid the silence unafraid,
Till, at some sudden turn, one sees
Against the black and muttering trees
Thine altar, wonderfully white,
Among the Forests of the Night.

TITLE The Song of the Beasts

RHYME a a b c c b a

Come away!  Come away!
Ye are sober and dull through the common day,
But now it is night!
It is shameful night, and God is asleep!
(Have you not felt the quick fires that creep
Through the hungry flesh, and the lust of delight,
And hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say?).

RHYME a a b c c b c

    The house is dumb;
The night calls out to you.        Come, ah, come!
Down the dim stairs, through the creaking door,
Naked, crawling on hands and feet
-- It is meet! it is meet!
Ye are men no longer, but less and more,
Beast and God. . . .  Down the lampless street,

RHYME a b a c b c

By little black ways, and secret places,
In the darkness and mire,
Faint laughter around, and evil faces
By the star-glint seen -- ah! follow with us!
For the darkness whispers a blind desire,
And the fingers of night are amorous.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c d d c

Because God put His adamantine fate
 Between my sullen heart and its desire,
I swore that I would burst the Iron Gate,
 Rise up, and curse Him on His throne of fire.
Earth shuddered at my crown of blasphemy,
 But Love was as a flame about my feet;
 Proud up the Golden Stair I strode; and beat
Thrice on the Gate, and entered with a cry --

RHYME a b a c b c

All the great courts were quiet in the sun,
 And full of vacant echoes:  moss had grown
Over the glassy pavement, and begun
 To creep within the dusty council-halls.
An idle wind blew round an empty throne
 And stirred the heavy curtains on the walls.

TITLE Ante Aram

RHYME a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a b a

Before thy shrine I kneel, an unknown worshipper,	
 Chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies,	
Incense of dirges, prayers that are as holy myrrh.	
Ah, goddess, on thy throne of tears and faint low sighs,
 Weary at last to theeward come the feet that err,	
And empty hearts grown tired of the world's vanities.	
How fair this cool deep silence to a wanderer		
 Deaf with the roar of winds along the open skies!	
Sweet, after sting and bitter kiss of sea-water,	
The pale Lethean wine within thy chalices!		
 I come before thee, I, too tired wanderer,		
To heed the horror of the shrine, the distant cries,	
And evil whispers in the gloom, or the swift whirr	
 Of terrible wings -- I, least of all thy votaries,	
With a faint hope to see the scented darkness stir,
And, parting, frame within its quiet mysteries
 One face, with lips than autumn-lilies tenderer,
And voice more sweet than the far plaint of viols is,
 Or the soft moan of any grey-eyed lute-player.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b a b a b

Opposite me two Germans snore and sweat.
 Through sullen swirling gloom we jolt and roar.
We have been here for ever:  even yet
 A dim watch tells two hours, two aeons, more.
The windows are tight-shut and slimy-wet
 With a night's foetor.  There are two hours more;
Two hours to dawn and Milan; two hours yet.
Opposite me two Germans sweat and snore. . . .

RHYME a a b b c c

One of them wakes, and spits, and sleeps again.
 The darkness shivers.  A wan light through the rain
Strikes on our faces, drawn and white.  Somewhere
 A new day sprawls; and, inside, the foul air
Is chill, and damp, and fouler than before. . . .
Opposite me two Germans sweat and snore.

TITLE The Call

RHYME a b a b

Out of the nothingness of sleep,
 The slow dreams of Eternity,
There was a thunder on the deep:
 I came, because you called to me.

RHYME a b a b

I broke the Night's primeval bars,
 I dared the old abysmal curse,
And flashed through ranks of frightened stars
 Suddenly on the universe!

RHYME a b a b

The eternal silences were broken;
 Hell became Heaven as I passed. --
What shall I give you as a token,
 A sign that we have met, at last?

RHYME a b a b

I'll break and forge the stars anew,
 Shatter the heavens with a song;
Immortal in my love for you,
 Because I love you, very strong.

RHYME a b a b

Your mouth shall mock the old and wise,
 Your laugh shall fill the world with flame,
I'll write upon the shrinking skies
 The scarlet splendour of your name,

RHYME a b a b

Till Heaven cracks, and Hell thereunder
 Dies in her ultimate mad fire,
And darkness falls, with scornful thunder,
 On dreams of men and men's desire.

RHYME a b a b

Then only in the empty spaces,
 Death, walking very silently,
Shall fear the glory of our faces
 Through all the dark infinity.

RHYME a b a b

So, clothed about with perfect love,
 The eternal end shall find us one,
Alone above the Night, above
 The dust of the dead gods, alone.

TITLE The Wayfarers

RHYME a b a b c c b a

Is it the hour?  We leave this resting-place
 Made fair by one another for a while.
Now, for a god-speed, one last mad embrace;
 The long road then, unlit by your faint smile.
Ah! the long road! and you so far away!
Oh, I'll remember! but . . . each crawling day
Will pale a little your scarlet lips, each mile
 Dull the dear pain of your remembered face.

RHYME a b c b a c

. . . Do you think there's a far border town, somewhere,
 The desert's edge, last of the lands we know,
    Some gaunt eventual limit of our light,
 In which I'll find you waiting; and we'll go
Together, hand in hand again, out there,
    Into the waste we know not, into the night?

TITLE The Beginning

RHYME a a b b b

Some day I shall rise and leave my friends
And seek you again through the world's far ends,
You whom I found so fair
(Touch of your hands and smell of your hair!),
My only god in the days that were.

RHYME a a *

My eager feet shall find you again,
Though the sullen years and the mark of pain
Have changed you wholly; for I shall know
(How could I forget having loved you so?),
In the sad half-light of evening,
The face that was all my sunrising.
So then at the ends of the earth I'll stand
And hold you fiercely by either hand,
And seeing your age and ashen hair
I'll curse the thing that once you were,
Because it is changed and pale and old
(Lips that were scarlet, hair that was gold!),

RHYME a a a

And I loved you before you were old and wise,
When the flame of youth was strong in your eyes,
-- And my heart is sick with memories.

TITLE Sonnet: Oh! Death Will Find Me, Long Before I Tire

RHYME a b a b

Oh! Death will find me, long before I tire
 Of watching you; and swing me suddenly
Into the shade and loneliness and mire
 Of the last land!  There, waiting patiently,

RHYME a b a b

One day, I think, I'll feel a cool wind blowing,
 See a slow light across the Stygian tide,
And hear the Dead about me stir, unknowing,
 And tremble.  And I shall know that you have died,

RHYME a b a b

And watch you, a broad-browed and smiling dream,
 Pass, light as ever, through the lightless host,
Quietly ponder, start, and sway, and gleam --
 Most individual and bewildering ghost! --

RHYME a a

And turn, and toss your brown delightful head
Amusedly, among the ancient Dead.

TITLE Sonnet: I Said I Splendidly Loved You; It�s Not True

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

I said I splendidly loved you; it's not true.
 Such long swift tides stir not a land-locked sea.
On gods or fools the high risk falls -- on you --
 The clean clear bitter-sweet that's not for me.
Love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist.
 Love is flung Lucifer-like from Heaven to Hell.
But -- there are wanderers in the middle mist,
 Who cry for shadows, clutch, and cannot tell
Whether they love at all, or, loving, whom:
 An old song's lady, a fool in fancy dress,
Or phantoms, or their own face on the gloom;
 For love of Love, or from heart's loneliness.
Pleasure's not theirs, nor pain.  They doubt, and sigh,
 And do not love at all.  Of these am I.

TITLE Success

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

I think if you had loved me when I wanted;
 If I'd looked up one day, and seen your eyes,
And found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted,
 And your brown face, that's full of pity and wise,
Flushed suddenly; the white godhead in new fear
 Intolerably so struggling, and so shamed;
Most holy and far, if you'd come all too near,
 If earth had seen Earth's lordliest wild limbs tamed,
Shaken, and trapped, and shivering, for MY touch --
 Myself should I have slain? or that foul you?
But this the strange gods, who had given so much,
 To have seen and known you, this they might not do.
One last shame's spared me, one black word's unspoken;
 And I'm alone; and you have not awoken.

TITLE Dust

RHYME a b a b

When the white flame in us is gone,
 And we that lost the world's delight
Stiffen in darkness, left alone
 To crumble in our separate night;

RHYME a b a b

When your swift hair is quiet in death,
 And through the lips corruption thrust
Has stilled the labour of my breath --
 When we are dust, when we are dust! --

RHYME a b a b

Not dead, not undesirous yet,
 Still sentient, still unsatisfied,
We'll ride the air, and shine, and flit,
 Around the places where we died,

RHYME a b a b

And dance as dust before the sun,
 And light of foot, and unconfined,
Hurry from road to road, and run
 About the errands of the wind.

RHYME a b a b

And every mote, on earth or air,
 Will speed and gleam, down later days,
And like a secret pilgrim fare
 By eager and invisible ways,

RHYME a b a b

Nor ever rest, nor ever lie,
 Till, beyond thinking, out of view,
One mote of all the dust that's I
 Shall meet one atom that was you.

RHYME a b a b

Then in some garden hushed from wind,
 Warm in a sunset's afterglow,
The lovers in the flowers will find
 A sweet and strange unquiet grow

RHYME a b a b

Upon the peace; and, past desiring,
 So high a beauty in the air,
And such a light, and such a quiring,
 And such a radiant ecstasy there,

RHYME a b a b

They'll know not if it's fire, or dew,
 Or out of earth, or in the height,
Singing, or flame, or scent, or hue,
 Or two that pass, in light, to light,

RHYME a b a b

Out of the garden, higher, higher. . . .
 But in that instant they shall learn
The shattering ecstasy of our fire,
 And the weak passionless hearts will burn

RHYME a b a b

And faint in that amazing glow,
 Until the darkness close above;
And they will know -- poor fools, they'll know! --
 One moment, what it is to love.

TITLE Kindliness

RHYME a a b c c b d d e a e a e a

When love has changed to kindliness --	
Oh, love, our hungry lips, that press	
So tight that Time's an old god's dream	
Nodding in heaven, and whisper stuff	
Seven million years were not enough	
To think on after, make it seem		
Less than the breath of children playing,
A blasphemy scarce worth the saying,	
A sorry jest, "When love has grown	
To kindliness -- to kindliness!" . . .	
And yet -- the best that either's known	
Will change, and wither, and be less,	
At last, than comfort, or its own	
Remembrance.  And when some caress	

RHYME a a b c c b d b d e d e

Tendered in habit (once a flame
All heaven sang out to) wakes the shame
Unworded, in the steady eyes
We'll have, -- THAT day, what shall we do?
Being so noble, kill the two
Who've reached their second-best?  Being wise,
Break cleanly off, and get away.
Follow down other windier skies
New lures, alone?  Or shall we stay,
Since this is all we've known, content
In the lean twilight of such day,
And not remember, not lament?

RHYME a a *

That time when all is over, and
Hand never flinches, brushing hand;
And blood lies quiet, for all you're near;
And it's but spoken words we hear,
Where trumpets sang; when the mere skies
Are stranger and nobler than your eyes;
And flesh is flesh, was flame before;
And infinite hungers leap no more
In the chance swaying of your dress;
And love has changed to kindliness.

TITLE Mummia

RHYME a b a b

As those of old drank mummia
 To fire their limbs of lead,
Making dead kings from Africa
 Stand pandar to their bed;

RHYME a b a b

Drunk on the dead, and medicined
 With spiced imperial dust,
In a short night they reeled to find
 Ten centuries of lust.

RHYME a b a b

So I, from paint, stone, tale, and rhyme,
 Stuffed love's infinity,
And sucked all lovers of all time
 To rarify ecstasy.

RHYME a b a b

Helen's the hair shuts out from me
 Verona's livid skies;
Gypsy the lips I press; and see
 Two Antonys in your eyes.

RHYME a b a b

The unheard invisible lovely dead
 Lie with us in this place,
And ghostly hands above my head
 Close face to straining face;

RHYME a b a b

Their blood is wine along our limbs;
 Their whispering voices wreathe
Savage forgotten drowsy hymns
 Under the names we breathe;

RHYME a b a b

Woven from their tomb, and one with it,
 The night wherein we press;
Their thousand pitchy pyres have lit
 Your flaming nakedness.

RHYME a b a b

For the uttermost years have cried and clung
 To kiss your mouth to mine;
And hair long dust was caught, was flung,
 Hand shaken to hand divine,

RHYME a b a b

And Life has fired, and Death not shaded,
 All Time's uncounted bliss,
And the height o' the world has flamed and faded,
 Love, that our love be this!

TITLE The Fish

RHYME a a *

In a cool curving world he lies
And ripples with dark ecstasies.
The kind luxurious lapse and steal
Shapes all his universe to feel
And know and be; the clinging stream
Closes his memory, glooms his dream,
Who lips the roots o' the shore, and glides
Superb on unreturning tides.
Those silent waters weave for him
A fluctuant mutable world and dim,
Where wavering masses bulge and gape
Mysterious, and shape to shape
Dies momently through whorl and hollow,
And form and line and solid follow
Solid and line and form to dream
Fantastic down the eternal stream;
An obscure world, a shifting world,
Bulbous, or pulled to thin, or curled,
Or serpentine, or driving arrows,
Or serene slidings, or March narrows.
There slipping wave and shore are one,
And weed and mud.  No ray of sun,
But glow to glow fades down the deep
(As dream to unknown dream in sleep);
Shaken translucency illumes
The hyaline of drifting glooms;
The strange soft-handed depth subdues
Drowned colour there, but black to hues,
As death to living, decomposes --
Red darkness of the heart of roses,
Blue brilliant from dead starless skies,
And gold that lies behind the eyes,
The unknown unnameable sightless white
That is the essential flame of night,
Lustreless purple, hooded green,
The myriad hues that lie between
Darkness and darkness! . And all's one.
Gentle, embracing, quiet, dun,
The world he rests in, world he knows,
Perpetual curving.  Only -- grows
An eddy in that ordered falling,
A knowledge from the gloom, a calling
Weed in the wave, gleam in the mud --
The dark fire leaps along his blood;
Dateless and deathless, blind and still,
The intricate impulse works its will;
His woven world drops back; and he,
Sans providence, sans memory,
Unconscious and directly driven,
Fades to some dank sufficient heaven.

RHYME a a *

O world of lips, O world of laughter,
Where hope is fleet and thought flies after,
Of lights in the clear night, of cries
That drift along the wave and rise
Thin to the glittering stars above,
You know the hands, the eyes of love!
The strife of limbs, the sightless clinging,
The infinite distance, and the singing
Blown by the wind, a flame of sound,
The gleam, the flowers, and vast around
The horizon, and the heights above --
You know the sigh, the song of love!

RHYME a a *

But there the night is close, and there
Darkness is cold and strange and bare;
And the secret deeps are whisperless;
And rhythm is all deliciousness;
And joy is in the throbbing tide,
Whose intricate fingers beat and glide
In felt bewildering harmonies
Of trembling touch; and music is
The exquisite knocking of the blood.
Space is no more, under the mud;
His bliss is older than the sun.
Silent and straight the waters run.
The lights, the cries, the willows dim,
And the dark tide are one with him.

TITLE Thoughts on the Shape of the Human Body

RHYME a a *

How can we find? how can we rest? how can
We, being gods, win joy, or peace, being man?
We, the gaunt zanies of a witless Fate,
Who love the unloving and lover hate,
Forget the moment ere the moment slips,
Kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips,
Who want, and know not what we want, and cry
With crooked mouths for Heaven, and throw it by.
Love's for completeness!  No perfection grows
'Twixt leg, and arm, elbow, and ear, and nose,
And joint, and socket; but unsatisfied
Sprawling desires, shapeless, perverse, denied.
Finger with finger wreathes; we love, and gape,
Fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape,
Straggling, irregular, perplexed, embossed,
Grotesquely twined, extravagantly lost
By crescive paths and strange protuberant ways
From sanity and from wholeness and from grace.
How can love triumph, how can solace be,
Where fever turns toward fever, knee toward knee?
Could we but fill to harmony, and dwell
Simple as our thought and as perfectible,
Rise disentangled from humanity
Strange whole and new into simplicity,
Grow to a radiant round love, and bear
Unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere,
Love moon to moon unquestioning, and be
Like the star Lunisequa, steadfastly
Following the round clear orb of her delight,
Patiently ever, through the eternal night!

TITLE Flight

RHYME a b a b b

Voices out of the shade that cried,
 And long noon in the hot calm places,
And children's play by the wayside,
 And country eyes, and quiet faces --
 All these were round my steady paces.

RHYME a b a b b

Those that I could have loved went by me;
 Cool gardened homes slept in the sun;
I heard the whisper of water nigh me,
 Saw hands that beckoned, shone, were gone
 In the green and gold.  And I went on.

RHYME a b a b b

For if my echoing footfall slept,
 Soon a far whispering there'd be
Of a little lonely wind that crept
 From tree to tree, and distantly
 Followed me, followed me. . . .

RHYME a b a b b

But the blue vaporous end of day
 Brought peace, and pursuit baffled quite,
Where between pine-woods dipped the way.
 I turned, slipped in and out of sight.
 I trod as quiet as the night.

RHYME a b a b b

The pine-boles kept perpetual hush;
 And in the boughs wind never swirled.
I found a flowering lowly bush,
 And bowed, slid in, and sighed and curled,
 Hidden at rest from all the world.

RHYME a b a b b

Safe!  I was safe, and glad, I knew!
 Yet -- with cold heart and cold wet brows
I lay.  And the dark fell. . . .  There grew
 Meward a sound of shaken boughs;
 And ceased, above my intricate house;

RHYME a b a b b

And silence, silence, silence found me. . . .
 I felt the unfaltering movement creep
Among the leaves.  They shed around me
 Calm clouds of scent, that I did weep;
 And stroked my face.  I fell asleep.

TITLE The Hill

RHYME a b b a c d c d

Breathless, we flung us on the windy hill,
 Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.
 You said, "Through glory and ecstasy we pass;
Wind, sun, and earth remain, the birds sing still,
When we are old, are old. . . ."  "And when we die
 All's over that is ours; and life burns on
Through other lovers, other lips," said I,
-- "Heart of my heart, our heaven is now, is won!"

RHYME a b b a c c

"We are Earth's best, that learnt her lesson here.
 Life is our cry.  We have kept the faith!" we said;
 "We shall go down with unreluctant tread
Rose-crowned into the darkness!" . . .  Proud we were,
And laughed, that had such brave true things to say.
-- And then you suddenly cried, and turned away.

TITLE The One Before the Last

RHYME a b a b

I dreamt I was in love again
 With the One Before the Last,
And smiled to greet the pleasant pain
 Of that innocent young past.

RHYME a b a b

But I jumped to feel how sharp had been
 The pain when it did live,
How the faded dreams of Nineteen-ten
 Were Hell in Nineteen-five.

RHYME a b a b

The boy's woe was as keen and clear,
 The boy's love just as true,
And the One Before the Last, my dear,
 Hurt quite as much as you.

RHYME a b a b

Sickly I pondered how the lover
 Wrongs the unanswering tomb,
And sentimentalizes over
 What earned a better doom.

RHYME a b a b

Gently he tombs the poor dim last time,
 Strews pinkish dust above,
And sighs, "The dear dead boyish pastime!
 But THIS -- ah, God! -- is Love!"

RHYME a b a b

-- Better oblivion hide dead true loves,
 Better the night enfold,
Than men, to eke the praise of new loves,
 Should lie about the old!

RHYME a b a b

Oh! bitter thoughts I had in plenty.
 But here's the worst of it --
I shall forget, in Nineteen-twenty,
 YOU ever hurt abit!

TITLE The Jolly Company

RHYME a b a b c c

The stars, a jolly company,
 I envied, straying late and lonely;
And cried upon their revelry:
 "O white companionship!  You only
In love, in faith unbroken dwell,
Friends radiant and inseparable!"

RHYME a b a b c c

Light-heart and glad they seemed to me
 And merry comrades (EVEN SO
GOD OUT OF HEAVEN MAY LAUGH TO SEE
 THE HAPPY CROWDS; AND NEVER KNOW
THAT IN HIS LONE OBSCURE DISTRESS
EACH WALKETH IN A WILDERNESS).

RHYME a b a b c c

But I, remembering, pitied well
 And loved them, who, with lonely light,
In empty infinite spaces dwell,
 Disconsolate.  For, all the night,
I heard the thin gnat-voices cry,
Star to faint star, across the sky.

TITLE The Life Beyond

RHYME a b a c b b d d b e c f e f c

HE wakes, who never thought to wake again,	
  Who held the end was Death. He opens eyes	
Slowly, to one long livid oozing plain	
  Closed down by the strange eyeless heavens.	
  He lies;	        
  And waits; and once in timeless sick surmise	
Through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand,	
Like a dry branch. No life is in that land,	
  Himself not lives, but is a thing that cries;	
An unmeaning point upon the mud; a speck	       
  Of moveless horror; an Immortal One	
Cleansed of the world, sentient and dead; a fly	
  Fast-stuck in grey sweat on a corpse�s neck.	
I though when love for you died, I should die.	
It�s dead. Alone, most strangely, I live on.

TITLE Lines Written in the Belief That the Ancient Roman Festival of the Dead Was Called Ambarvalia

RHYME a b c b

Swings the way still by hollow and hill,
 And all the world's a song;
"She's far," it sings me, "but fair," it rings me,
 "Quiet," it laughs, "and strong!"

RHYME a b c b

Oh! spite of the miles and years between us,
 Spite of your chosen part,
I do remember; and I go
 With laughter in my heart.

RHYME a b c b

So above the little folk that know not,
 Out of the white hill-town,
High up I clamber; and I remember;
 And watch the day go down.

RHYME a b c b

Gold is my heart, and the world's golden,
 And one peak tipped with light;
And the air lies still about the hill
 With the first fear of night;

RHYME a b c b

Till mystery down the soundless valley
 Thunders, and dark is here;
And the wind blows, and the light goes,
 And the night is full of fear,

RHYME a b c b

And I know, one night, on some far height,
 In the tongue I never knew,
I yet shall hear the tidings clear
 From them that were friends of you.

RHYME a b c b

They'll call the news from hill to hill,
 Dark and uncomforted,
Earth and sky and the winds; and I
 Shall know that you are dead.

RHYME a b c b

I shall not hear your trentals,
 Nor eat your arval bread;
For the kin of you will surely do
 Their duty by the dead.

RHYME a b c b

Their little dull greasy eyes will water;
 They'll paw you, and gulp afresh.
They'll sniffle and weep, and their thoughts will creep
 Like flies on the cold flesh.

RHYME a b c b

They will put pence on your grey eyes,
 Bind up your fallen chin,
And lay you straight, the fools that loved you
 Because they were your kin.

They will praise all the bad about you,
 And hush the good away,
And wonder how they'll do without you,
 And then they'll go away.

RHYME a b c b

But quieter than one sleeping,
 And stranger than of old,
You will not stir for weeping,
 You will not mind the cold;

RHYME a b c b

But through the night the lips will laugh not,
 The hands will be in place,
And at length the hair be lying still
 About the quiet face.

RHYME a b c b

With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,
 And dim and decorous mirth,
With ham and sherry, they'll meet to bury
 The lordliest lass of earth.

RHYME a b c b

The little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving
 Behind lone-riding you,
The heart so high, the heart so living,
 Heart that they never knew.

RHYME a b c b

I shall not hear your trentals,
 Nor eat your arval bread,
Nor with smug breath tell lies of death
 To the unanswering dead.

RHYME a b c b

With snuffle and sniff and handkerchief,
 The folk who loved you not
Will bury you, and go wondering
 Back home.  And you will rot.

RHYME a b c b

But laughing and half-way up to heaven,
 With wind and hill and star,
I yet shall keep, before I sleep,
 Your Ambarvalia.

TITLE Dead Men�s Love

RHYME a b a b c c d d

There was a damned successful Poet;
 There was a Woman like the Sun.
And they were dead.  They did not know it.
 They did not know their time was done.
    They did not know his hymns
    Were silence; and her limbs,
    That had served Love so well,
    Dust, and a filthy smell.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

And so one day, as ever of old,
 Hands out, they hurried, knee to knee;
On fire to cling and kiss and hold
 And, in the other's eyes, to see
    Each his own tiny face,
    And in that long embrace
    Feel lip and breast grow warm
    To breast and lip and arm.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

So knee to knee they sped again,
 And laugh to laugh they ran, I'm told,
Across the streets of Hell  And then
 They suddenly felt the wind blow cold,
    And knew, so closely pressed,
    Chill air on lip and breast,
    And, with a sick surprise,
    The emptiness of eyes.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b

Here, where love's stuff is body, arm and side
 Are stabbing-sweet 'gainst chair and lamp and wall.
In every touch more intimate meanings hide;
 And flaming brains are the white heart of all.

RHYME a b a b

Here, million pulses to one centre beat:
 Closed in by men's vast friendliness, alone,
Two can be drunk with solitude, and meet
 On the sheer point where sense with knowing's one.

RHYME a b a b

Here the green-purple clanging royal night,
 And the straight lines and silent walls of town,
And roar, and glare, and dust, and myriad white
 Undying passers, pinnacle and crown

RHYME a b a b

Intensest heavens between close-lying faces
 By the lamp's airless fierce ecstatic fire;
And we've found love in little hidden places,
 Under great shades, between the mist and mire.

RHYME a b a b

Stay! though the woods are quiet, and you've heard
 Night creep along the hedges.  Never go
Where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird,
 And the remote winds sigh, and waters flow!

RHYME a b a b

Lest -- as our words fall dumb on windless noons,
 Or hearts grow hushed and solitary, beneath
Unheeding stars and unfamiliar moons,
 Or boughs bend over, close and quiet as death, --

RHYME a b a b

Unconscious and unpassionate and still,
 Cloud-like we lean and stare as bright leaves stare,
And gradually along the stranger hill
 Our unwalled loves thin out on vacuous air,

RHYME a b a b

And suddenly there's no meaning in our kiss,
 And your lit upward face grows, where we lie,
Lonelier and dreadfuller than sunlight is,
 And dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky.

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b c c

For moveless limbs no pity I crave,
 That never were swift!  Still all I prize,
Laughter and thought and friends, I have;
 No fool to heave luxurious sighs
For the woods and hills that I never knew.
The more excellent way's yet mine!  And you

RHYME a b a b c c

Flower-laden come to the clean white cell,
 And we talk as ever -- am I not the same?
With our hearts we love, immutable,
 You without pity, I without shame.
We talk as of old; as of old you go
Out under the sky, and laughing, I know,

RHYME a b a b c c

Flit through the streets, your heart all me;
 Till you gain the world beyond the town.
Then -- I fade from your heart, quietly;
 And your fleet steps quicken.  The strong down
Smiles you welcome there; the woods that love you
Close lovely and conquering arms above you.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

O ever-moving, O lithe and free!
 Fast in my linen prison I press
On impassable bars, or emptily
 Laugh in my great loneliness.
And still in the white neat bed I strive
Most impotently against that gyve;
Being less now than a thought, even,
To you alone with your hills and heaven.

TITLE Menelaus and Helen

RHYME a b b a c d d c

Hot through Troy's ruin Menelaus broke
 To Priam's palace, sword in hand, to sate
 On that adulterous whore a ten years' hate
And a king's honour.  Through red death, and smoke,
And cries, and then by quieter ways he strode,
 Till the still innermost chamber fronted him.
 He swung his sword, and crashed into the dim
Luxurious bower, flaming like a god.

RHYME a b c c b a

High sat white Helen, lonely and serene.
 He had not remembered that she was so fair,
And that her neck curved down in such a way;
And he felt tired.  He flung the sword away,
 And kissed her feet, and knelt before her there,
The perfect Knight before the perfect Queen.

RHYME a b b a a c c a

So far the poet.  How should he behold
 That journey home, the long connubial years?
 He does not tell you how white Helen bears
Child on legitimate child, becomes a scold,
Haggard with virtue.  Menelaus bold
 Waxed garrulous, and sacked a hundred Troys
 'Twixt noon and supper.  And her golden voice
Got shrill as he grew deafer.  And both were old.

RHYME a b a b c c

Often he wonders why on earth he went
 Troyward, or why poor Paris ever came.
Oft she weeps, gummy-eyed and impotent;
 Her dry shanks twitch at Paris' mumbled name.
So Menelaus nagged; and Helen cried;
And Paris slept on by Scamander side.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c d c d

How should I know?  The enormous wheels of will
 Drove me cold-eyed on tired and sleepless feet.
Night was void arms and you a phantom still,
 And day your far light swaying down the street.
As never fool for love, I starved for you;
 My throat was dry and my eyes hot to see.
Your mouth so lying was most heaven in view,
 And your remembered smell most agony.

RHYME a b c a b c

Love wakens love!  I felt your hot wrist shiver
 And suddenly the mad victory I planned
  Flashed real, in your burning bending head. . . .
My conqueror's blood was cool as a deep river
 In shadow; and my heart beneath your hand
  Quieter than a dead man on a bed.

TITLE 

RHYME a a *

When I see you, who were so wise and cool,
Gazing with silly sickness on that fool
You've given your love to, your adoring hands
Touch his so intimately that each understands,
I know, most hidden things; and when I know
Your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow
Of his red lips, and that the empty grace
Of those strong legs and arms, that rosy face,
Has beaten your heart to such a flame of love,
That you have given him every touch and move,
Wrinkle and secret of you, all your life,
-- Oh! then I know I'm waiting, lover-wife,
For the great time when love is at a close,
And all its fruit's to watch the thickening nose
And sweaty neck and dulling face and eye,
That are yours, and you, most surely, till you die!
Day after day you'll sit with him and note
The greasier tie, the dingy wrinkling coat;
As prettiness turns to pomp, and strength to fat,
And love, love, love to habit!  And after that,
When all that's fine in man is at an end,
And you, that loved young life and clean, must tend
A foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old,
When his rare lips hang flabby and can't hold
Slobber, and you're enduring that worst thing,
Senility's queasy furtive love-making,
And searching those dear eyes for human meaning,
Propping the bald and helpless head, and cleaning
A scrap that life's flung by, and love's forgotten, --
Then you'll be tired; and passion dead and rotten;
And he'll be dirty, dirty!  O lithe and free
And lightfoot, that the poor heart cries to see,
That's how I'll see your man and you! --  But you
-- Oh, when THAT time comes, you'll be dirty too!

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b

My restless blood now lies a-quiver,
 Knowing that always, exquisitely,
This April twilight on the river
 Stirs anguish in the heart of me.

RHYME a b a b

For the fast world in that rare glimmer
 Puts on the witchery of a dream,
The straight grey buildings, richly dimmer,
 The fiery windows, and the stream

RHYME a b a b

With willows leaning quietly over,
 The still ecstatic fading skies . . .
And all these, like a waiting lover,
 Murmur and gleam, lift lustrous eyes,

RHYME a b a b

Drift close to me, and sideways bending
 Whisper delicious words.  But I
Stretch terrible hands, uncomprehending,
 Shaken with love; and laugh; and cry.

RHYME a b a b

My agony made the willows quiver;
 I heard the knocking of my heart
Die loudly down the windless river,
 I heard the pale skies fall apart,

RHYME a b a b

And the shrill stars' unmeaning laughter,
 And my voice with the vocal trees
Weeping.  And Hatred followed after,
 Shrilling madly down the breeze.

RHYME a b a b

In peace from the wild heart of clamour,
 A flower in moonlight, she was there,
Was rippling down white ways of glamour
 Quietly laid on wave and air.

RHYME a b a b

Her passing left no leaf a-quiver.
 Pale flowers wreathed her white, white brows.
Her feet were silence on the river;
 And "Hush!" she said, between the boughs.

TITLE Song

RHYME a b a b c d c d

�OH! Love,� they said, �is King of Kings,	
  And Triumph is his crown.	
Earth fades in flame before his wings,	
  And Sun and Moon bow down.��	
But that, I knew, would never do;	        
  And Heaven is all too high.	
So whenever I meet a Queen, I said,	
  I will not catch her eye.	
  
RHYME a b a b c d c d

�Oh! Love,� they said, and �Love,� they said,	
  �The gift of Love is this;	       
A crown of thorns about thy head,	
  And vinegar to thy kiss!��	
But Tragedy is not for me;	
  And I�m content to be gay.	
So whenever I spied a Tragic Lady,	       
  I went another way.	
  
RHYME a b a b c d c d

And so I never feared to see	
  You wander down the street,	
Or come across the fields to me	
  On ordinary feet.	       
For what they�d never told me of,	
  And what I never knew;	
It was that all the time, my love,	
  Love would be merely you.	

TITLE Dining-Room Tea

RHYME a a *

When you were there, and you, and you,
Happiness crowned the night; I too,
Laughing and looking, one of all,
I watched the quivering lamplight fall
On plate and flowers and pouring tea
And cup and cloth; and they and we
Flung all the dancing moments by
With jest and glitter.  Lip and eye
Flashed on the glory, shone and cried,
Improvident, unmemoried;
And fitfully and like a flame
The light of laughter went and came.
Proud in their careless transience moved
The changing faces that I loved.

RHYME a a *

Till suddenly, and otherwhence,
I looked upon your innocence.
For lifted clear and still and strange
From the dark woven flow of change
Under a vast and starless sky
I saw the immortal moment lie.
One instant I, an instant, knew
As God knows all.  And it and you

RHYME  a a a

I, above Time, oh, blind! could see
In witless immortality.
I saw the marble cup; the tea,

RHYME a a *

Hung on the air, an amber stream;
I saw the fire's unglittering gleam,
The painted flame, the frozen smoke.
No more the flooding lamplight broke
On flying eyes and lips and hair;
But lay, but slept unbroken there,
On stiller flesh, and body breathless,
And lips and laughter stayed and deathless,
And words on which no silence grew.
Light was more alive than you.

RHYME a a *

For suddenly, and otherwhence,
I looked on your magnificence.
I saw the stillness and the light,
And you, august, immortal, white,
Holy and strange; and every glint
Posture and jest and thought and tint
Freed from the mask of transiency,
Triumphant in eternity,

RHYME a a *

                   Dazed at length
Human eyes grew, mortal strength
Wearied; and Time began to creep.
Change closed about me like a sleep.
Light glinted on the eyes I loved.
The cup was filled.  The bodies moved.
The drifting petal came to ground.
The laughter chimed its perfect round.
The broken syllable was ended.
And I, so certain and so friended,
How could I cloud, or how distress,
The heaven of your unconsciousness?
Or shake at Time's sufficient spell,
Stammering of lights unutterable?
The eternal holiness of you,
The timeless end, you never knew,
The peace that lay, the light that shone.
You never knew that I had gone
A million miles away, and stayed
A million years.  The laughter played
Unbroken round me; and the jest
Flashed on.  And we that knew the best
Down wonderful hours grew happier yet.
I sang at heart, and talked, and eat,
And lived from laugh to laugh, I too,
When you were there, and you, and you.

TITLE The Goddess in the Wood
  
RHYME a b b a c d d c

IN a flowered dell the Lady Venus stood,	
  Amazed with sorrow. Down the morning one	
  Far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun	
Rang out; and held; and died.� She thought the wood	
Grew quieter. Wing, and leaf, and pool of light	        
  Forgot to dance. Dumb lay the unfalling stream;	
  Life one eternal instant rose in dream	
Clear out of time, poised on a golden height.�	
  
RHYME a b c a b c

Till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour.	
The gold waves purled amidst the green above her;	       
  And a bird sang. With one sharp-taken breath,	
By sunlit branches and unshaken flower,	
The immortal limbs flashed to the human lover,	
  And the immortal eyes to look on death.

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b c d c d

The damned ship lurched and slithered.  Quiet and quick
 My cold gorge rose; the long sea rolled; I knew
I must think hard of something, or be sick;
 And could think hard of only one thing -- YOU!
You, you alone could hold my fancy ever!
 And with you memories come, sharp pain, and dole.
Now there's a choice -- heartache or tortured liver!
 A sea-sick body, or a you-sick soul!

RHYME a b a b c c

Do I forget you?  Retchings twist and tie me,
 Old meat, good meals, brown gobbets, up I throw.
Do I remember?  Acrid return and slimy,
 The sobs and slobber of a last years woe.
And still the sick ship rolls.  'Tis hard, I tell ye,
To choose 'twixt love and nausea, heart and belly.

TITLE

RHYME a b b a a b b a

All night the ways of Heaven were desolate,
 Long roads across a gleaming empty sky.
 Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,
Alone, serene beyond all love or hate,
Terror or triumph, were content to wait,
 We, silent and all-knowing.  Suddenly
 Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high,
One horseman, downward to the earth's low gate.

RHYME a b c b a c

Oh, perfect from the ultimate height of living,
 Lightly we turned, through wet woods blossom-hung,
Into the open.  Down the supernal roads,
 With plumes a-tossing, purple flags far flung,
Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,
 Thundered the black battalions of the Gods.

Through my heart's palace Thoughts unnumbered throng;
 And there, most quiet and, as a child, most wise,
High-throned you sit, and gracious.  All day long
 Great Hopes gold-armoured, jester Fantasies,
 And pilgrim Dreams, and little beggar Sighs,
Bow to your benediction, go their way.
 And the grave jewelled courtier Memories
Worship and love and tend you, all the day.

RHYME a b c b a c

But when I sleep, and all my thoughts go straying,
 When the high session of the day is ended,
And darkness comes; then, with the waning light,
 By lilied maidens on your way attended,
Proud from the wonted throne, superbly swaying,
 You, like a queen, pass out into the night.

TITLE Choriambics�I
  
RHYME a a * 

AH! not now, when desire burns, and the wind calls, and the suns of spring	
Light-foot dance in the woods, whisper of life, woo me to wayfaring;	
Ah! not now should you come, now when the road beckons, and good friends call,	
Where are songs to be sung, fights to be fought, yea! and the best of all,	
Love, on myriad lips fairer than yours, kisses you could not give!	        
Dearest, why should I mourn, whimper, and whine, I that have yet to live?	
Sorrow will I forget, tears for the best, love on the lips of you,	
Now, when dawn in the blood wakes, and the sun laughs up the eastern blue;	
I�ll forget and be glad! Only at length, dear, when the great day ends,	
When love dies with the last light, and the last song has been sung, and friends
All are perished, and gloom strides on the heaven: then, as alone I lie,	
�Mid Death�s gathering winds, frightened and dumb, sick for the past, may I	
Feel you suddenly there, cool at my brow; then may I hear the peace	
Of your voice at the last, whispering love, calling, ere all can cease	
In the silence of death; then may I see dimly, and know, a space,	
Bending over me, last light in the dark, once, as of old, your face.

TITLE Choriambics�II
  
RHYME a a *

HERE the flame that was ash, shrine that was void, lost in the haunted wood,	
I have tended and loved, year upon year, I in the solitude	
Waiting, quiet and glad-eyed in the dark, knowing that once a gleam	
Glowed and went through the wood. Still I abode strong in a golden dream,	
Unrecaptured. For I, I that had faith, knew that a face would glance	
One day, white in the dim woods, and a voice call, and a radiance	
Fill the grove, and the fire suddenly leap� and, in the heart of it,	
End of labouring, you! Therefore I kept ready the altar, lit	
The flame, burning apart. Face of my dreams vainly in vision white	
Gleaming down to me, lo! hopeless I rise now. For about midnight	
Whispers grew through the wood suddenly, strange cries in the boughs above	
Grated, cries like a laugh. Silent and black then through the sacred grove	
Great birds flew, as a dream, troubling the leaves, passing at length. I knew 	
Long expected and long loved, that afar, God of the dim wood, you	
Somewhere lay, as a child sleeping, a child suddenly reft from mirth,	
White and wonderful yet, white in your youth, stretched upon foreign earth,	
God, immortal and dead!	Therefore I go; never to rest, or win	
Peace, and worship of you more, and the dumb wood and the shrine therein.	

TITLE Desertion

RHYME a a *

So light we were, so right we were, so fair faith shone,
And the way was laid so certainly, that, when I'd gone,
What dumb thing looked up at you?  Was it something heard,
Or a sudden cry, that meekly and without a word
You broke the faith, and strangely, weakly, slipped apart.
You gave in -- you, the proud of heart, unbowed of heart!
Was this, friend, the end of all that we could do?
And have you found the best for you, the rest for you?
Did you learn so suddenly (and I not by!)
Some whispered story, that stole the glory from the sky,
And ended all the splendid dream, and made you go
So dully from the fight we know, the light we know?

RHYME a a *

O faithless! the faith remains, and I must pass
Gay down the way, and on alone.  Under the grass
You wait; the breeze moves in the trees, and stirs, and calls,
And covers you with white petals, with light petals.
There it shall crumble, frail and fair, under the sun,
O little heart, your brittle heart; till day be done,
And the shadows gather, falling light, and, white with dew,
Whisper, and weep; and creep to you.  Good sleep to you!

TITLE Peace

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Now, God be thanked Who has matched us with His hour,
 And caught our youth, and wakened us from sleeping,
With hand made sure, clear eye, and sharpened power,
 To turn, as swimmers into cleanness leaping,
Glad from a world grown old and cold and weary,
 Leave the sick hearts that honour could not move,
And half-men, and their dirty songs and dreary,
 And all the little emptiness of love!

RHYME a b c a b c

Oh! we, who have known shame, we have found release there,
 Where there's no ill, no grief, but sleep has mending,
  Naught broken save this body, lost but breath;
Nothing to shake the laughing heart's long peace there
 But only agony, and that has ending;
  And the worst friend and enemy is but Death.

TITLE Safety

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Dear! of all happy in the hour, most blest
 He who has found our hid security,
Assured in the dark tides of the world that rest,
 And heard our word, `Who is so safe as we?'
We have found safety with all things undying,
 The winds, and morning, tears of men and mirth,
The deep night, and birds singing, and clouds flying,
 And sleep, and freedom, and the autumnal earth.
We have built a house that is not for Time's throwing.
 We have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever.
War knows no power.  Safe shall be my going,
 Secretly armed against all death's endeavour;
Safe though all safety's lost; safe where men fall;
And if these poor limbs die, safest of all.

TITLE The Dead

RHYME a b b a c d d c

Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!
 There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,
 But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.
These laid the world away; poured out the red
Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be
 Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,
 That men call age; and those who would have been,
Their sons, they gave, their immortality.

RHYME a b a c b c

Blow, bugles, blow!  They brought us, for our dearth,
 Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.
Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,
 And paid his subjects with a royal wage;
And Nobleness walks in our ways again;
 And we have come into our heritage.

TITLE The Dead

RHYME a b a b c d c d

These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,
 Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.
The years had given them kindness.  Dawn was theirs,
 And sunset, and the colours of the earth.
These had seen movement, and heard music; known
 Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;
Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;
 Touched flowers and furs and cheeks.  All this is ended.

RHYME a a b c b c

There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
And lit by the rich skies, all day.  And after,
 Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance
And wandering loveliness.  He leaves a white
 Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,
A width, a shining peace, under the night.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c d c d

If I should die, think only this of me:
 That there's some corner of a foreign field
That is for ever England.  There shall be
 In that rich earth a richer dust concealed;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,
 Gave, once, her flowers to love, her ways to roam,
A body of England's, breathing English air,
 Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.

RHYME a b c a b c

And think, this heart, all evil shed away,
 A pulse in the eternal mind, no less
  Gives somewhere back the thoughts by England given;
Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;
 And laughter, learnt of friends; and gentleness,
  In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c c

When colour goes home into the eyes,
 And lights that shine are shut again
With dancing girls and sweet birds' cries
 Behind the gateways of the brain;
And that no-place which gave them birth, shall close
The rainbow and the rose: --

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Still may Time hold some golden space
 Where I'll unpack that scented store
Of song and flower and sky and face,
 And count, and touch, and turn them o'er,
Musing upon them; as a mother, who
Has watched her children all the rich day through
Sits, quiet-handed, in the fading light,
When children sleep, ere night.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Mamua, when our laughter ends,
And hearts and bodies, brown as white,
Are dust about the doors of friends,
Or scent ablowing down the night,
Then, oh! then, the wise agree,
Comes our immortality.
Mamua, there waits a land
Hard for us to understand.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e e

Out of time, beyond the sun,
All are one in Paradise,
You and Pupure are one,
And Tau, and the ungainly wise.
There the Eternals are, and there
The Good, the Lovely, and the True,
And Types, whose earthly copies were
The foolish broken things we knew;
There is the Face, whose ghosts we are;
The real, the never-setting Star;

RHYME a b c a b d d c d

And the Flower, of which we love
Faint and fading shadows here;
Never a tear, but only Grief;
Dance, but not the limbs that move;
Songs in Song shall disappear;
Instead of lovers, Love shall be;
For hearts, Immutability;
And there, on the Ideal Reef,
Thunders the Everlasting Sea!

RHYME a a b a 

And my laughter, and my pain,	
Shall home to the Eternal Brain.	
And all lovely things, they say,	       
Meet in Loveliness again;

RHYME a b a c c	

Miri�s laugh, Te�po�s feet,	
And the hands of Matua,	
Stars and sunlight there shall meet,
Coral�s hues and rainbows there,	       
And Te�ra�s braided hair;	

RHYME a b a b

And with the starred tiare�s white,	
And white birds in the dark ravine,	
And flamboyants ablaze at night,	
And jewels, and evening�s after-green,	   

RHYME a a b c b c    

And dawns of pearl and gold and red,	
Mamua, your lovelier head!	
And there�ll no more be one who dreams	
Under the ferns, of crumbling stuff,	
Eyes of illusion, mouth that seems,	       
All time-entangled human love.	

RHYME a b b a c c d e d e

And you�ll no longer swing and sway	
Divinely down the scented shade,	
Where feet to Ambulation fade,	
And moons are lost in endless Day.	       
How shall we wind these wreaths of ours,	
Where there are neither heads nor flowers?	
Oh, Heaven�s Heaven!�but we�ll be missing	
The palms, and sunlight, and the south;	
And there�s an end, I think, of kissing,	       
When our mouths are one with Mouth.
  
RHYME a b c b c d b d e e b

  Ta� here, Mamua,	
Crown the hair, and come away!	
Hear the calling of the moon,	
And the whispering scents that stray	       
About the idle warm lagoon.	
Hasten, hand in human hand,	
Down the dark, the flowered way,	
Along the whiteness of the sand,	
And in the water�s soft caress,	       
Wash the mind of foolishness,	
Mamua, until the day.	

RHYME a b a b c d c d e e

Spend the glittering moonlight there	
Pursuing down the soundless deep	
Limbs that gleam and shadowy hair,	       
Or floating lazy, half-asleep.	
Dive and double and follow after,	
Snare in flowers, and kiss, and call,	
With lips that fade, and human laughter	
And faces individual,	       
Well this side of Paradise!
There�s little comfort in the wise.

TITLE Retrospect

RHYME a a *

In your arms was still delight,
Quiet as a street at night;
And thoughts of you, I do remember,
Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,
Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.
Love, in you, went passing by,
Penetrative, remote, and rare,
Like a bird in the wide air,
And, as the bird, it left no trace
In the heaven of your face.
In your stupidity I found
The sweet hush after a sweet sound.
All about you was the light
That dims the greying end of night;
Desire was the unrisen sun,
Joy the day not yet begun,
With tree whispering to tree,
Without wind, quietly.
Wisdom slept within your hair,
And Long-Suffering was there,
And, in the flowing of your dress,
Undiscerning Tenderness.
And when you thought, it seemed to me,
Infinitely, and like a sea,
About the slight world you had known
Your vast unconsciousness was thrown. . . .

RHYME a a *

O haven without wave or tide!
Silence, in which all songs have died!
Holy book, where hearts are still!
And home at length under the hill!
O mother quiet, breasts of peace,
Where love itself would faint and cease!
O infinite deep I never knew,
I would come back, come back to you,
Find you, as a pool unstirred,
Kneel down by you, and never a word,
Lay my head, and nothing said,
In your hands, ungarlanded;
And a long watch you would keep;
And I should sleep, and I should sleep!

TITLE

RHYME a a *

I have been so great a lover:  filled my days
So proudly with the splendour of Love's praise,
The pain, the calm, and the astonishment,
Desire illimitable, and still content,
And all dear names men use, to cheat despair,
For the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
Our hearts at random down the dark of life.
Now, ere the unthinking silence on that strife
Steals down, I would cheat drowsy Death so far,
My night shall be remembered for a star
That outshone all the suns of all men's days.
Shall I not crown them with immortal praise
Whom I have loved, who have given me, dared with me
High secrets, and in darkness knelt to see
The inenarrable godhead of delight?
Love is a flame; -- we have beaconed the world's night.
A city: -- and we have built it, these and I.
An emperor: -- we have taught the world to die.
So, for their sakes I loved, ere I go hence,
And the high cause of Love's magnificence,
And to keep loyalties young, I'll write those names
Golden for ever, eagles, crying flames,
And set them as a banner, that men may know,
To dare the generations, burn, and blow
Out on the wind of Time, shining and streaming. . . .
These I have loved:  White plates and cups, clean-gleaming,
Ringed with blue lines; and feathery, faery dust;
Wet roofs, beneath the lamp-light; the strong crust
Of friendly bread; and many-tasting food;
Rainbows; and the blue bitter smoke of wood;
And radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers;
And flowers themselves, that sway through sunny hours,
Dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon;
Then, the cool kindliness of sheets, that soon
Smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss
Of blankets; grainy wood; live hair that is
Shining and free; blue-massing clouds; the keen
Unpassioned beauty of a great machine;
The benison of hot water; furs to touch;
The good smell of old clothes; and other such --
The comfortable smell of friendly fingers,
Hair's fragrance, and the musty reek that lingers
About dead leaves and last year's ferns Dear names,
And thousand other throng to me!  Royal flames;
Sweet water's dimpling laugh from tap or spring;
Holes in the ground; and voices that do sing;
Voices in laughter, too; and body's pain,
Soon turned to peace; and the deep-panting train;
Firm sands; the little dulling edge of foam
That browns and dwindles as the wave goes home;
And washen stones, gay for an hour; the cold
Graveness of iron; moist black earthen mould;
Sleep; and high places; footprints in the dew;
And oaks; and brown horse-chestnuts, glossy-new;
And new-peeled sticks; and shining pools on grass; --
All these have been my loves.  And these shall pass,
Whatever passes not, in the great hour,
Nor all my passion, all my prayers, have power
To hold them with me through the gate of Death.
They'll play deserter, turn with the traitor breath,
Break the high bond we made, and sell Love's trust
And sacramented covenant to the dust.
---- Oh, never a doubt but, somewhere, I shall wake,
And give what's left of love again, and make
New friends, now strangers.  But the best I've known,
Stays here, and changes, breaks, grows old, is blown
About the winds of the world, and fades from brains
Of living men, and dies.  Nothing remains.
O dear my loves, O faithless, once again
This one last gift I give:  that after men
Shall know, and later lovers, far-removed,
Praise you, "All these were lovely"; say, "He loved."

TITLE Heaven

RHYME a a *

Fish (fly-replete, in depth of June,
Dawdling away their wat'ry noon)
Ponder deep wisdom, dark or clear,
Each secret fishy hope or fear.
Fish say, they have their Stream and Pond;
But is there anything Beyond?
This life cannot be All, they swear,
For how unpleasant, if it were!
One may not doubt that, somehow, Good
Shall come of Water and of Mud;
And, sure, the reverent eye must see
A Purpose in Liquidity.
We darkly know, by Faith we cry,
The future is not Wholly Dry.
Mud unto mud! -- Death eddies near --
Not here the appointed End, not here!
But somewhere, beyond Space and Time.
Is wetter water, slimier slime!
And there (they trust) there swimmeth One
Who swam ere rivers were begun,
Immense, of fishy form and mind,
Squamous, omnipotent, and kind;
And under that Almighty Fin,
The littlest fish may enter in.
Oh! never fly conceals a hook,
Fish say, in the Eternal Brook,
But more than mundane weeds are there,
And mud, celestially fair;
Fat caterpillars drift around,
And Paradisal grubs are found;
Unfading moths, immortal flies,
And the worm that never dies.
And in that Heaven of all their wish,
There shall be no more land, say fish.

TITLE Doubts

RHYME a b a b c b a c

When she sleeps, her soul, I know,
Goes a wanderer on the air,
Wings where I may never go,
Leaves her lying, still and fair,
Waiting, empty, laid aside,
Like a dress upon a chair. . . .
This I know, and yet I know
Doubts that will not be denied.

RHYME a a b b c d c d

For if the soul be not in place,
What has laid trouble in her face?
And, sits there nothing ware and wise
Behind the curtains of her eyes,
What is it, in the self's eclipse,
Shadows, soft and passingly,
About the corners of her lips,
The smile that is essential she?

RHYME a a

And if the spirit be not there,
Why is fragrance in the hair?

TITLE

RHYME a a *

"Oh love is fair, and love is rare;" my dear one she said,
"But love goes lightly over."  I bowed her foolish head,
And kissed her hair and laughed at her.  Such a child was she;
So new to love, so true to love, and she spoke so bitterly.

RHYME a a *

But there's wisdom in women, of more than they have known,
And thoughts go blowing through them, are wiser than their own,
Or how should my dear one, being ignorant and young,
Have cried on love so bitterly, with so true a tongue?

TITLE

RHYME a b a b

I have peace to weigh your worth, now all is over,
 But if to praise or blame you, cannot say.
For, who decries the loved, decries the lover;
 Yet what man lauds the thing he's thrown away?

RHYME a b a b

Be you, in truth, this dull, slight, cloudy naught,
 The more fool I, so great a fool to adore;
But if you're that high goddess once I thought,
 The more your godhead is, I lose the more.

RHYME a b a b

Dear fool, pity the fool who thought you clever!
 Dear wisdom, do not mock the fool that missed you!
Most fair, -- the blind has lost your face for ever!
 Most foul, -- how could I see you while I kissed you?

RHYME a a 

So . . . the poor love of fools and blind I've proved you,
For, foul or lovely, 'twas a fool that loved you.

TITLE A Memory

RHYME a b b a c d d c

Somewhile before the dawn I rose, and stept
 Softly along the dim way to your room,
 And found you sleeping in the quiet gloom,
And holiness about you as you slept.
I knelt there; till your waking fingers crept
 About my head, and held it.  I had rest
 Unhoped this side of Heaven, beneath your breast.
I knelt a long time, still; nor even wept.

RHYME a b c b c a

It was great wrong you did me; and for gain
Of that poor moment's kindliness, and ease,
And sleepy mother-comfort!  Child, you know
How easily love leaps out to dreams like these,
Who has seen them true.  And love that's wakened so
Takes all too long to lay asleep again.

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Today I have been happy.  All the day
 I held the memory of you, and wove
Its laughter with the dancing light o' the spray,
 And sowed the sky with tiny clouds of love,
And sent you following the white waves of sea,
 And crowned your head with fancies, nothing worth,
Stray buds from that old dust of misery,
 Being glad with a new foolish quiet mirth.

RHYME a a b c b c

So lightly I played with those dark memories,
Just as a child, beneath the summer skies,
 Plays hour by hour with a strange shining stone,
For which (he knows not) towns were fire of old,
 And love has been betrayed, and murder done,
And great kings turned to a little bitter mould.

TITLE

RHYME a b b a a b b a

Warm perfumes like a breath from vine and tree
 Drift down the darkness.  Plangent, hidden from eyes
 Somewhere an `eukaleli' thrills and cries
And stabs with pain the night's brown savagery.
And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me,
 Gleam like a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise;
 And new stars burn into the ancient skies,
Over the murmurous soft Hawaian sea.

RHYME a b a b c c

And I recall, lose, grasp, forget again,
 And still remember, a tale I have heard, or known,
An empty tale, of idleness and pain,
 Of two that loved -- or did not love -- and one
Whose perplexed heart did evil, foolishly,
A long while since, and by some other sea.

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b c d c d

In the grey tumult of these after years
 Oft silence falls; the incessant wranglers part;
And less-than-echoes of remembered tears
 Hush all the loud confusion of the heart;
And a shade, through the toss'd ranks of mirth and crying
 Hungers, and pains, and each dull passionate mood, --
Quite lost, and all but all forgot, undying,
 Comes back the ecstasy of your quietude.

RHYME a a b c b c

So a poor ghost, beside his misty streams,
Is haunted by strange doubts, evasive dreams,
 Hints of a pre-Lethean life, of men,
Stars, rocks, and flesh, things unintelligible,
 And light on waving grass, he knows not when,
And feet that ran, but where, he cannot tell.

TITLE

RHYME a b b a c d d c

Not with vain tears, when we're beyond the sun,
 We'll beat on the substantial doors, nor tread
 Those dusty high-roads of the aimless dead
Plaintive for Earth; but rather turn and run
Down some close-covered by-way of the air,
 Some low sweet alley between wind and wind,
 Stoop under faint gleams, thread the shadows, find
Some whispering ghost-forgotten nook, and there

RHYME a b a b a b

Spend in pure converse our eternal day;
 Think each in each, immediately wise;
Learn all we lacked before; hear, know, and say
 What this tumultuous body now denies;
And feel, who have laid our groping hands away;
 And see, no longer blinded by our eyes.

TITLE 

RHYME a b b a a b b a

Down the blue night the unending columns press
 In noiseless tumult, break and wave and flow,
 Now tread the far South, or lift rounds of snow
Up to the white moon's hidden loveliness.
Some pause in their grave wandering comradeless,
 And turn with profound gesture vague and slow,
 As who would pray good for the world, but know
Their benediction empty as they bless.

RHYME a b c a c b

They say that the Dead die not, but remain
 Near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth.
    I think they ride the calm mid-heaven, as these,
In wise majestic melancholy train,
    And watch the moon, and the still-raging seas,
 And men, coming and going on the earth.

TITLE

RHYME a b b a c d d c

They say there's a high windless world and strange,
 Out of the wash of days and temporal tide,
 Where Faith and Good, Wisdom and Truth abide,
`Aeterna corpora', subject to no change.
There the sure suns of these pale shadows move;
 There stand the immortal ensigns of our war;
 Our melting flesh fixed Beauty there, a star,
And perishing hearts, imperishable Love. . . .

RHYME a b c a c b

Dear, we know only that we sigh, kiss, smile;
 Each kiss lasts but the kissing; and grief goes over;
 Love has no habitation but the heart.
Poor straws! on the dark flood we catch awhile,
 Cling, and are borne into the night apart.
 The laugh dies with the lips, `Love' with the lover.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Now that we've done our best and worst, and parted,
 I would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend.
(O heart, I do not dare go empty-hearted)
 I'll think of Love in books, Love without end;
Women with child, content; and old men sleeping;
 And wet strong ploughlands, scarred for certain grain;
And babes that weep, and so forget their weeping;
 And the young heavens, forgetful after rain;
And evening hush, broken by homing wings;
 And Song's nobility, and Wisdom holy,
That live, we dead.  I would think of a thousand things,
 Lovely and durable, and taste them slowly,
One after one, like tasting a sweet food.
I have need to busy my heart with quietude.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Love is a breach in the walls, a broken gate,
 Where that comes in that shall not go again;
Love sells the proud heart's citadel to Fate.
 They have known shame, who love unloved.  Even then,
When two mouths, thirsty each for each, find slaking,
 And agony's forgot, and hushed the crying
Of credulous hearts, in heaven -- such are but taking
 Their own poor dreams within their arms, and lying
Each in his lonely night, each with a ghost.
 Some share that night.  But they know love grows colder,
Grows false and dull, that was sweet lies at most.
 Astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder,
But darkens, and dies out from kiss to kiss.
All this is love; and all love is but this.

TITLE

RHYME a b b a c d c d 

Heart, you are restless as a paper scrap
 That's tossed down dusty pavements by the wind;
 Saying, "She is most wise, patient and kind.
Between the small hands folded in her lap
Surely a shamed head may bow down at length,
 And find forgiveness where the shadows stir
About her lips, and wisdom in her strength,
 Peace in her peace.  Come to her, come to her!" 

RHYME a b b c a c

She will not care.  She'll smile to see me come,
 So that I think all Heaven in flower to fold me.
 She'll give me all I ask, kiss me and hold me,
    And open wide upon that holy air
The gates of peace, and take my tiredness home,
    Kinder than God.  But, heart, she will not care.

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b b

Your hands, my dear, adorable,
 Your lips of tenderness
-- Oh, I've loved you faithfully and well,
 Three years, or a bit less.
 It wasn't a success.

RHYME a b c b b

Thank God, that's done! and I'll take the road,
 Quit of my youth and you,
The Roman road to Wendover
 By Tring and Lilley Hoo,
 As a free man may do.

RHYME a b a b b

For youth goes over, the joys that fly,
 The tears that follow fast;
And the dirtiest things we do must lie
 Forgotten at the last;
 Even Love goes past.

RHYME a b a b b

What's left behind I shall not find,
 The splendour and the pain;
The splash of sun, the shouting wind,
 And the brave sting of rain,
 I may not meet again.

RHYME a b a b b

But the years, that take the best away,
 Give something in the end;
And a better friend than love have they,
 For none to mar or mend,
 That have themselves to friend.

RHYME a b a b b

I shall desire and I shall find
 The best of my desires;
The autumn road, the mellow wind
 That soothes the darkening shires.
 And laughter, and inn-fires.

RHYME a b a b b

White mist about the black hedgerows,
 The slumbering Midland plain,
The silence where the clover grows,
 And the dead leaves in the lane,
 Certainly, these remain.

RHYME a b c b b

And I shall find some girl perhaps,
 And a better one than you,
With eyes as wise, but kindlier,
 And lips as soft, but true.
 And I daresay she will do.

I came back late and tired last night
 Into my little room,
To the long chair and the firelight
 And comfortable gloom.

RHYME a b a b c b

But as I entered softly in
 I saw a woman there,
The line of neck and cheek and chin,
 The darkness of her hair,
The form of one I did not know
 Sitting in my chair.

RHYME a b c b

I stood a moment fierce and still,
 Watching her neck and hair.
I made a step to her; and saw
 That there was no one there.

RHYME a b a b

It was some trick of the firelight
 That made me see her there.
It was a chance of shade and light
 And the cushion in the chair.

RHYME a b c b c b

Oh, all you happy over the earth,
 That night, how could I sleep?
I lay and watched the lonely gloom;
 And watched the moonlight creep
From wall to basin, round the room,
 All night I could not sleep.

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b

Hands and lit faces eddy to a line;
 The dazed last minutes click; the clamour dies.
Beyond the great-swung arc o' the roof, divine,
 Night, smoky-scarv'd, with thousand coloured eyes

RHYME a b a b

Glares the imperious mystery of the way.
 Thirsty for dark, you feel the long-limbed train
Throb, stretch, thrill motion, slide, pull out and sway,
 Strain for the far, pause, draw to strength again. . . .

RHYME a b a b

As a man, caught by some great hour, will rise,
 Slow-limbed, to meet the light or find his love;
And, breathing long, with staring sightless eyes,
 Hands out, head back, agape and silent, move

RHYME a b a b

Sure as a flood, smooth as a vast wind blowing;
 And, gathering power and purpose as he goes,
Unstumbling, unreluctant, strong, unknowing,
 Borne by a will not his, that lifts, that grows,

RHYME a b a b

Sweep out to darkness, triumphing in his goal,
 Out of the fire, out of the little room. . . .
-- There is an end appointed, O my soul!
 Crimson and green the signals burn; the gloom

RHYME a b a b

Is hung with steam's far-blowing livid streamers.
 Lost into God, as lights in light, we fly,
Grown one with will, end-drunken huddled dreamers.
 The white lights roar.  The sounds of the world die.

RHYME a b a b

And lips and laughter are forgotten things.
 Speed sharpens; grows.  Into the night, and on,
The strength and splendour of our purpose swings.
 The lamps fade; and the stars.  We are alone.

TITLE Song

RHYME a b c b

All suddenly the wind comes soft,
 And Spring is here again;
And the hawthorn quickens with buds of green,
 And my heart with buds of pain.

RHYME a b c b

My heart all Winter lay so numb,
 The earth so dead and frore,
That I never thought the Spring would come,
 Or my heart wake any more.

RHYME a b c b

But Winter's broken and earth has woken,
 And the small birds cry again;
And the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds,
 And my heart puts forth its pain.

When Beauty and Beauty meet
 All naked, fair to fair,
The earth is crying-sweet,
 And scattering-bright the air,
Eddying, dizzying, closing round,
 With soft and drunken laughter;
Veiling all that may befall
 After -- after --

RHYME a b a b c d e d

Where Beauty and Beauty met,
 Earth's still a-tremble there,
And winds are scented yet,
 And memory-soft the air,
Bosoming, folding glints of light,
 And shreds of shadowy laughter;
Not the tears that fill the years
 After -- after --

TITLE 

RHYME a b a b

The way that lovers use is this;
 They bow, catch hands, with never a word,
And their lips meet, and they do kiss,
 -- So I have heard.

RHYME a b a b

They queerly find some healing so,
 And strange attainment in the touch;
There is a secret lovers know,
 -- I have read as much.

RHYME a b a b

And theirs no longer joy nor smart,
 Changing or ending, night or day;
But mouth to mouth, and heart on heart,
 -- So lovers say.

RHYME a a *

Young Mary, loitering once her garden way,
Felt a warm splendour grow in the April day,
As wine that blushes water through.  And soon,
Out of the gold air of the afternoon,
One knelt before her:  hair he had, or fire,
Bound back above his ears with golden wire,
Baring the eager marble of his face.
Not man's nor woman's was the immortal grace
Rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white,
And lighting the proud eyes with changeless light,
Incurious.  Calm as his wings, and fair,
That presence filled the garden.  She stood there,
Saying, "What would you, Sir?"  He told his word,
"Blessed art thou of women!"  Half she heard,
Hands folded and face bowed, half long had known,
The message of that clear and holy tone,
That fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart;
Such serene tidings moved such human smart.
Her breath came quick as little flakes of snow.
Her hands crept up her breast.  She did but know
It was not hers.  She felt a trembling stir
Within her body, a will too strong for her
That held and filled and mastered all.  With eyes
Closed, and a thousand soft short broken sighs,
She gave submission; fearful, meek, and glad. . . .
She wished to speak.  Under her breasts she had
Such multitudinous burnings, to and fro,
And throbs not understood; she did not know
If they were hurt or joy for her; but only
That she was grown strange to herself, half lonely,
All wonderful, filled full of pains to come
And thoughts she dare not think, swift thoughts and dumb,
Human, and quaint, her own, yet very far,
Divine, dear, terrible, familiar . . .
Her heart was faint for telling; to relate
Her limbs' sweet treachery, her strange high estate,
Over and over, whispering, half revealing,
Weeping; and so find kindness to her healing.
'Twixt tears and laughter, panic hurrying her,
She raised her eyes to that fair messenger.
He knelt unmoved, immortal; with his eyes
Gazing beyond her, calm to the calm skies;
Radiant, untroubled in his wisdom, kind.
His sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind.
How should she, pitiful with mortality,
Try the wide peace of that felicity
With ripples of her perplexed shaken heart,
And hints of human ecstasy, human smart,
And whispers of the lonely weight she bore,
And how her womb within was hers no more
And at length hers? Being tired, she bowed her head;
And said, "So be it!"  The great wings were spread
Showering glory on the fields, and fire.
The whole air, singing, bore him up, and higher,

RHYME a a a

Unswerving, unreluctant.  Soon he shone
A gold speck in the gold skies; then was gone.
The air was colder, and grey.  She stood alone.

The day that YOUTH had died,
There came to his grave-side,
In decent mourning, from the country's ends,
Those scatter'd friends

RHYME a b c a c b

Who had lived the boon companions of his prime,
And laughed with him and sung with him and wasted,
In feast and wine and many-crown'd carouse,
The days and nights and dawnings of the time
When YOUTH kept open house,
Nor left untasted

RHYME a b b a 

Aught of his high emprise and ventures dear,	
No quest of his unshar�d	
All these, with loitering feet and sad head bar�d,	
Followed their old friend�s bier.

RHYME a a *
	
Folly went first,	       
With muffled bells and coxcomb still revers�d;	
And after trod the bearers, hat in hand�	
Laughter, most hoarse, and Captain Pride with tanned	
And martial face all grim, and fussy Joy	
Who had to catch a train, and Lust, poor, snivelling boy;	       
These bore the dear departed.	
Behind them, broken-hearted,	

RHYME a a a

Came Grief, so noisy a widow, that all said,	
�Had he but wed	
Her elder sister Sorrow, in her stead!�	       

RHYME a a *

And by her, trying to soothe her all the time,	
The fatherless children, Colour, Tune, and Rhyme	
(The sweet lad Rhyme), ran all-uncomprehending.	
Then, at the way�s sad ending,	
Round the raw grave they stay�d. Old Wisdom read,	       
In mumbling tone, the Service for the Dead.	

RHYME a b c a d b c d

There stood Romance,	
The furrowing tears had mark�d her roug�d cheek;	
Poor old Conceit, his wonder unassuaged;	
Dead Innocency�s daughter, Ignorance;	       
And shabby, ill-dress�d Generosity;	
And Argument, too full of woe to speak;	
Passion, grown portly, something middle-aged;	
And Friendship�not a minute older, she;	

RHYME a a b c b d c d

Impatience, ever taking out his watch;	       
Faith, who was deaf, and had to lean, to catch	
Old Wisdom�s endless drone.	
Beauty was there,	
Pale in her black; dry-eyed; she stood alone.	
Poor maz�d Imagination; Fancy wild;	       
Ardour, the sunlight on his greying hair;	
Contentment, who had known Youth as a child	

RHYME a b c a b c

And never seen him since. And Spring came too,	
Dancing over the tombs, and brought him flowers�	
She did not stay for long.	       
And Truth, and Grace, and all the merry crew,	
The laughing Winds and Rivers, and lithe Hours;	
And Hope, the dewy-eyed; and sorrowing Song;�	

RHYME a a a b b

Yes, with much woe and mourning general,	
At dead Youth�s funeral,	       
Even these were met once more together, all,	
Who erst the fair and living Youth did know;	
All, except only Love. Love had died long ago.

TITLE The Old Vicarage, Grantchester

RHYME a a *

JUST now the lilac is in bloom,	
All before my little room;	
And in my flower-beds, I think,	
Smile the carnation and the pink;	
And down the borders, well I know,	        
The poppy and the pansy blow
Oh! there the chestnuts, summer through,	
Beside the river make for you	
A tunnel of green gloom, and sleep	
Deeply above; and green and deep	       
The stream mysterious glides beneath,	
Green as a dream and deep as death.	
�Oh, damn! I know it! and I know	
How the May fields all golden show,	
And when the day is young and sweet,	       
Gild gloriously the bare feet	
That run to bathe, Du lieber Gott!	
Here am I, sweating, sick, and hot,	
And there the shadowed waters fresh	       
Lean up to embrace the naked flesh.	
Temperamentvoll German Jews	
Drink beer around;�and there the dews	
Are soft beneath a morn of gold.	
Here tulips bloom as they are told;	       
Unkempt about those hedges blows	
An English unofficial rose;	
And there the unregulated sun	
Slopes down to rest when day is done,	
And wakes a vague unpunctual star,	       
A slippered Hesper; and there are	
Meads towards Haslingfield and Coton	
Where das Betreten�s not verboten.	
  
RHYME a a *

... would I were	
In Grantchester, in Grantchester!�	       
Some, it may be, can get in touch	
With Nature there, or Earth, or such.	
And clever modern men have seen	
A Faun a-peeping through the green,	
And felt the Classics were not dead,	       
To glimpse a Naiad�s reedy head,	
Or hear the Goat-foot piping low:
But these are things I do not know.	
I only know that you may lie	
Day long and watch the Cambridge sky,	       
And, flower-lulled in sleepy grass,	
Hear the cool lapse of hours pass,	
Until the centuries blend and blur	
In Grantchester, in Grantchester.
Still in the dawnlit waters cool	       
His ghostly Lordship swims his pool,	
And tries the strokes, essays the tricks,	
Long learnt on Hellespont, or Styx.	
Dan Chaucer hears his river still	
Chatter beneath a phantom mill.	       
Tennyson notes, with studious eye,	
How Cambridge waters hurry by
And in that garden, black and white,	
Creep whispers through the grass all night;	
And spectral dance, before the dawn,	       
A hundred Vicars down the lawn;	
Curates, long dust, will come and go	
On lissom, clerical, printless toe;	
And oft between the boughs is seen	
The sly shade of a Rural Dean
Till, at a shiver in the skies,	
Vanishing with Satanic cries,	
The prim ecclesiastic rout	
Leaves but a startled sleeper-out,	
Grey heavens, the first bird�s drowsy calls,	       
The falling house that never falls.	
  
RHYME a a *

God! I will pack, and take a train,	
And get me to England once again!	
For England�s the one land, I know,	
Where men with Splendid Hearts may go;	       
And Cambridgeshire, of all England,	
The shire for Men who Understand;	
And of that district I prefer	
The lovely hamlet Grantchester.	
For Cambridge people rarely smile,	       
Being urban, squat, and packed with guile;	
And Royston men in the far South	
Are black and fierce and strange of mouth;	
At Over they fling oaths at one,	
And worse than oaths at Trumpington,	       
And Ditton girls are mean and dirty,	
And there�s none in Harston under thirty,	
And folks in Shelford and those parts	
Have twisted lips and twisted hearts,	
And Barton men make Cockney rhymes,	       
And Coton�s full of nameless crimes,	
And things are done you�d not believe	
At Madingley on Christmas Eve.	
Strong men have run for miles and miles,	
When one from Cherry Hinton smiles;	       
Strong men have blanched, and shot their wives,	
Rather than send them to St. Ives;	
Strong men have cried like babes, bydam,	
To hear what happened at Babraham.	
But Grantchester! ah, Grantchester!	      
There�s peace and holy quiet there,	
Great clouds along pacific skies,	
And men and women with straight eyes,	
Lithe children lovelier than a dream,	
A bosky wood, a slumbrous stream,	      
And little kindly winds that creep	
Round twilight corners, half asleep.	
In Grantchester their skins are white;	
They bathe by day, they bathe by night;	
The women there do all they ought;	      
The men observe the Rules of Thought.	
They love the Good; they worship Truth;	
They laugh uproariously in youth;	
(And when they get to feeling old,	
They up and shoot themselves, I�m told)
  Ah God! to see the branches stir	
Across the moon at Grantchester!	
To smell the thrilling-sweet and rotten	
Unforgettable, unforgotten	
River-smell, and hear the breeze	      
Sobbing in the little trees.	
Say, do the elm-clumps greatly stand	
Still guardians of that holy land?	
The chestnuts shade, in reverend dream,	
The yet unacademic stream?	      
Is dawn a secret shy and cold	
Anadyomene, silver-gold?	
And sunset still a golden sea	
From Haslingfield to Madingley?	
And after, ere the night is born,	      
Do hares come out about the corn?	
Oh, is the water sweet and cool,	
Gentle and brown, above the pool?	
And laughs the immortal river still	
Under the mill, under the mill?	      
Say, is there Beauty yet to find?	
And Certainty? and Quiet kind?	
Deep meadows yet, for to forget	
The lies, and truths, and pain?� oh! yet	
Stands the Church clock at ten to three?	      
And is there honey still for tea?

TITLE Fafaia

RHYME a a *

Stars that seem so close and bright,
Watched by lovers through the night,
Swim in emptiness, men say,
Many a mile and year away.

And yonder star that burns so white,
May have died to dust and night
Ten, maybe, or fifteen year,
Before it shines upon my dear.

Oh! often among men below,
Heart cries out to heart, I know,
And one is dust a many years,
Child, before the other hears.

Heart from heart is all as far,
Fafaia, as start from star.

AUTHOR Lord Byron

TITLE Don Juan, Dedication

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Bob Southey! You're a poet, poet laureate,		
       And representative of all the race.
     Although 'tis true that you turned out a Tory at
       Last, yours has lately been a common case.
     And now my epic renegade, what are ye at
       With all the lakers, in and out of place?
     A nest of tuneful persons, to my eye
     Like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye,

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Which pye being opened they began to sing'		
       (This old song and new simile holds good),	
     'A dainty dish to set before the King'		
       Or Regent, who admires such kind of food.	
     And Coleridge too has lately taken wing,		
       But like a hawk encumbered with his hood,	
     Explaining metaphysics to the nation.		
     I wish he would explain his explanation.		

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     You, Bob, are rather insolent, you know,
       At being disappointed in your wish
     To supersede all warblers here below,
       And be the only blackbird in the dish.
     And then you overstrain yourself, or so,
       And tumble downward like the flying fish
     Gasping on deck, because you soar too high,
     Bob, And fall for lack of moisture quite a dry 

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Wordsworth in a rather long Excursion
       (I think the quarto holds five hundred pages)
     Has given a sample from the vasty version
       Of his new system to perplex the sages.
     'Tis poetry, at least by his assertion,
       And may appear so when the Dog Star rages,
     And he who understands it would be able
     To add a story to the tower of Babel.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     You gentlemen, by dint of long seclusion
       From better company, have kept your own
     At Keswick, and through still continued fusion
       Of one another's minds at last have grown
     To deem, as a most logical conclusion,
       That poesy has wreaths for you alone.
     There is a narrowness in such a notion,
     Which makes me wish you'd change your lakes for ocean.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I would not imitate the petty thought,
       Nor coin my self-love to so base a vice,
     For all the glory your conversion brought,
       Since gold alone should not have been its price.
     You have your salary; was't for that you wrought?
       And Wordsworth has his place in the Excise.
     You're shabby fellows--true--but poets still
     And duly seated on the immortal hill.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Your bays may hide the baldness of your brows,
       Perhaps some virtuous blushes; let them go.
     To you I envy neither fruit nor boughs,
       And for the fame you would engross below,
     The field is universal and allows
       Scope to all such as feel the inherent glow.
     Scott, Rogers, Campbell, Moore, and Crabbe will try
     'Gainst you the question with posterity.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For me, who, wandering with pedestrian Muses,
       Contend not with you on the winged' steed,
     I wish your fate may yield ye, when she chooses,
       The fame you envy and the skill you need.
     And recollect a poet nothing loses
       In giving to his brethren their full meed
     Of merit, and complaint of present days
     Is not the certain path to future praise.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He that reserves his laurels for posterity
       (Who does not often claim the bright reversion)
     Has generally no great crop to spare it, he
       Being only injured by his own assertion.
     And although here and there some glorious rarity
       Arise like Titan from the sea's immersion,
     The major part of such appellants go
     To--God knows where--for no one else can know.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If fallen in evil days on evil tongues,
       Milton appealed to the avenger, Time,
     If Time, the avenger, execrates his wrongs
       And makes the word Miltonic mean sublime,
     He deigned not to belie his soul in songs,
       Nor turn his very talent to a crime.
     He did not loathe the sire to laud the son,
     But closed the tyrant-hater he begun.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Think'st thou, could he, the blind old man, arise
       Like Samuel from the grave to freeze once more
     The blood of monarchs with his prophecies,
        Or be alive again--again all hoar
     With time and trials, and those helpless eyes
       And heartless daughters--worn and pale and poor,
     Would he adore a sultan? He obey
     The intellectual eunuch Castlereagh?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Cold-blooded, smooth-faced, placid miscreant!
       Dabbling its sleek young hands in Erin's gore,
     And thus for wider carnage taught to pant,
       Transferred to gorge upon a sister shore,
     The vulgarest tool that tyranny could want,
       With just enough of talent and no more,
     To lengthen fetters by another fixed
     And offer poison long already mixed.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     An orator of such set trash of phrase,
       Ineffably, legitimately vile,
     That even its grossest flatterers dare not praise,
       Nor foes--all nations--condescend to smile.
     Not even a sprightly blunder's spark can blaze
       From that Ixion grindstone's ceaseless toil,
     That turns and turns to give the world a notion
     Of endless torments and perpetual motion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A bungler even in its disgusting trade,
       And botching, patching, leaving still behind
     Something of which its masters are afraid,
       States to be curbed and thoughts to be confined,
     Conspiracy or congress to be made,
       Cobbling at manacles for all mankind,
     A tinkering slave-maker, who mends old chains,
     With God and man's abhorrence for its gains.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If we may judge of matter by the mind,
     Emasculated to the marrow, it
     Hath but two objects, how to serve and bind,
     Deeming the chain it wears even men may fit,
     Eutropius of its many masters, blind
     To worth as freedom, wisdom as to wit,
     Fearless, because no feeling dwells in ice;
     Its very courage stagnates to a vice.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Where shall I turn me not to view its bonds,
       For I will never feel them. Italy,
     Thy late reviving Roman soul desponds
       Beneath the lie this state-thing breathed o'er thee.
     Thy clanking chain and Erin's yet green wounds
       Have voices, tongues to cry aloud for me.
     Europe has slaves, allies, kings, armies still,
     And Southey lives to sing them very ill.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Meantime, Sir Laureate, I proceed to dedicate
       In honest simple verse this song to you.
     And if in flattering strains I do not predicate,
       'Tis that I still retain my buff and blue;
     My politics as yet are all to educate.
       Apostasy's so fashionable too,
     To keep one creed's a task grown quite
     Herculean Is it not so, my Tory, ultra-Julian?

TITLE Don Juan, I

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I want a hero: an uncommon want,
       When every year and month sends forth a new one,
     Till, after cloying the gazettes with cant,
       The age discovers he is not the true one;
     Of such as these I should not care to vaunt,
       I 'll therefore take our ancient friend Don Juan--
     We all have seen him, in the pantomime,
     Sent to the devil somewhat ere his time.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Vernon, the butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,
       Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,
     Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,
       And fill'd their sign posts then, like Wellesley now;
     Each in their turn like Banquo's monarchs stalk,
       Followers of fame, 'nine farrow' of that sow:
     France, too, had Buonaparte and Dumourier
     Recorded in the Moniteur and Courier.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Barnave, Brissot, Condorcet, Mirabeau,
       Petion, Clootz, Danton, Marat, La Fayette,
     Were French, and famous people, as we know:
       And there were others, scarce forgotten yet,
     Joubert, Hoche, Marceau, Lannes, Desaix, Moreau,
       With many of the military set,
     Exceedingly remarkable at times,
     But not at all adapted to my rhymes.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Nelson was once Britannia's god of war,
       And still should be so, but the tide is turn'd;
     There 's no more to be said of Trafalgar,
       'T is with our hero quietly inurn'd;
     Because the army 's grown more popular,
       At which the naval people are concern'd;
     Besides, the prince is all for the land-service,
     Forgetting Duncan, Nelson, Howe, and Jervis.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Brave men were living before Agamemnon
       And since, exceeding valorous and sage,
     A good deal like him too, though quite the same none;
       But then they shone not on the poet's page,
     And so have been forgotten:--I condemn none,
       But can't find any in the present age
     Fit for my poem (that is, for my new one);
     So, as I said, I 'll take my friend Don Juan.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Most epic poets plunge 'in medias res'
       (Horace makes this the heroic turnpike road),
     And then your hero tells, whene'er you please,
       What went before--by way of episode,
     While seated after dinner at his ease,
       Beside his mistress in some soft abode,
     Palace, or garden, paradise, or cavern,
     Which serves the happy couple for a tavern.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     That is the usual method, but not mine--
       My way is to begin with the beginning;
     The regularity of my design
       Forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning,
     And therefore I shall open with a line
       (Although it cost me half an hour in spinning)
     Narrating somewhat of Don Juan's father,
     And also of his mother, if you 'd rather.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In Seville was he born, a pleasant city,
       Famous for oranges and women--he
     Who has not seen it will be much to pity,
       So says the proverb--and I quite agree;
     Of all the Spanish towns is none more pretty,
       Cadiz perhaps--but that you soon may see;
     Don Juan's parents lived beside the river,
     A noble stream, and call'd the Guadalquivir.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     His father's name was Jose--Don, of course,--
       A true Hidalgo, free from every stain
     Of Moor or Hebrew blood, he traced his source
       Through the most Gothic gentlemen of Spain;
     A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse,
       Or, being mounted, e'er got down again,
     Than Jose, who begot our hero, who
     Begot--but that 's to come--Well, to renew:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     His mother was a learned lady, famed
       For every branch of every science known
     In every Christian language ever named,
       With virtues equall'd by her wit alone,
     She made the cleverest people quite ashamed,
       And even the good with inward envy groan,
     Finding themselves so very much exceeded
     In their own way by all the things that she did.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her memory was a mine: she knew by heart
       All Calderon and greater part of Lope,
     So that if any actor miss'd his part
       She could have served him for the prompter's copy;
     For her Feinagle's were an useless art,
       And he himself obliged to shut up shop--he
     Could never make a memory so fine as
     That which adorn'd the brain of Donna Inez.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her favourite science was the mathematical,
       Her noblest virtue was her magnanimity,
     Her wit (she sometimes tried at wit) was Attic all,
       Her serious sayings darken'd to sublimity;
     In short, in all things she was fairly what I call
       A prodigy--her morning dress was dimity,
     Her evening silk, or, in the summer, muslin,
     And other stuffs, with which I won't stay puzzling.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She knew the Latin--that is, 'the Lord's prayer,'
       And Greek--the alphabet--I 'm nearly sure;
     She read some French romances here and there,
       Although her mode of speaking was not pure;
     For native Spanish she had no great care,
       At least her conversation was obscure;
     Her thoughts were theorems, her words a problem,
     As if she deem'd that mystery would ennoble 'em.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some women use their tongues--she look'd a lecture,
       Each eye a sermon, and her brow a homily,
     An all-in-all sufficient self-director,
       Like the lamented late Sir Samuel Romilly,
     The Law's expounder, and the State's corrector,
       Whose suicide was almost an anomaly--
     One sad example more, that 'All is vanity'
     (The jury brought their verdict in 'Insanity').

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In short, she was a walking calculation,
       Miss Edgeworth's novels stepping from their covers,
     Or Mrs. Trimmer's books on education,
       Or 'Coelebs' Wife' set out in quest of lovers,
     Morality's prim personification,
       In which not Envy's self a flaw discovers;
     To others' share let 'female errors fall,'
     For she had not even one--the worst of all.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O! she was perfect past all parallel--
       Of any modern female saint's comparison;
     So far above the cunning powers of hell,
       Her guardian angel had given up his garrison;
     Even her minutest motions went as well
       As those of the best time-piece made by Harrison:
     In virtues nothing earthly could surpass her,
     Save thine 'incomparable oil,' Macassar!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Perfect she was, but as perfection is
       Insipid in this naughty world of ours,
     Where our first parents never learn'd to kiss
       Till they were exiled from their earlier bowers,
     Where all was peace, and innocence, and bliss
       (I wonder how they got through the twelve hours),
     Don Jose, like a lineal son of Eve,
     Went plucking various fruit without her leave.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He was a mortal of the careless kind,
       With no great love for learning, or the learn'd,
     Who chose to go where'er he had a mind,
       And never dream'd his lady was concern'd;
     The world, as usual, wickedly inclined
       To see a kingdom or a house o'erturn'd,
     Whisper'd he had a mistress, some said two--
     But for domestic quarrels one will do.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now Donna Inez had, with all her merit,
       A great opinion of her own good qualities;
     Neglect, indeed, requires a saint to bear it,
       And such, indeed, she was in her moralities;
     But then she had a devil of a spirit,
       And sometimes mix'd up fancies with realities,
     And let few opportunities escape
     Of getting her liege lord into a scrape.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This was an easy matter with a man
       Oft in the wrong, and never on his guard;
     And even the wisest, do the best they can,
       Have moments, hours, and days, so unprepared,
     That you might 'brain them with their lady's fan;'
       And sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard,
     And fans turn into falchions in fair hands,
     And why and wherefore no one understands.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is pity learned virgins ever wed
       With persons of no sort of education,
     Or gentlemen, who, though well born and bred,
       Grow tired of scientific conversation:
     I don't choose to say much upon this head,
       I 'm a plain man, and in a single station,
     But--Oh! ye lords of ladies intellectual,
     Inform us truly, have they not hen-peck'd you all?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Don Jose and his lady quarrell'd--why,
       Not any of the many could divine,
     Though several thousand people chose to try,
       'T was surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
     I loathe that low vice--curiosity;
       But if there 's anything in which I shine,
     'T is in arranging all my friends' affairs,
     Not having of my own domestic cares.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And so I interfered, and with the best
       Intentions, but their treatment was not kind;
     I think the foolish people were possess'd,
       For neither of them could I ever find,
     Although their porter afterwards confess'd--
       But that 's no matter, and the worst 's behind,
     For little Juan o'er me threw, down stairs,
     A pail of housemaid's water unawares.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A little curly-headed, good-for-nothing,
       And mischief-making monkey from his birth;
     His parents ne'er agreed except in doting
       Upon the most unquiet imp on earth;
     Instead of quarrelling, had they been but both in
       Their senses, they 'd have sent young master forth
     To school, or had him soundly whipp'd at home,
     To teach him manners for the time to come.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Don Jose and the Donna Inez led
       For some time an unhappy sort of life,
     Wishing each other, not divorced, but dead;
       They lived respectably as man and wife,
     Their conduct was exceedingly well-bred,
       And gave no outward signs of inward strife,
     Until at length the smother'd fire broke out,
     And put the business past all kind of doubt.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For Inez call'd some druggists and physicians,
       And tried to prove her loving lord was mad;
     But as he had some lucid intermissions,
       She next decided he was only bad;
     Yet when they ask'd her for her depositions,
       No sort of explanation could be had,
     Save that her duty both to man and God
     Required this conduct--which seem'd very odd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She kept a journal, where his faults were noted,
       And open'd certain trunks of books and letters,
     All which might, if occasion served, be quoted;
       And then she had all Seville for abettors,
     Besides her good old grandmother (who doted);
       The hearers of her case became repeaters,
     Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,
     Some for amusement, others for old grudges.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then this best and weakest woman bore
       With such serenity her husband's woes,
     Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,
       Who saw their spouses kill'd, and nobly chose
     Never to say a word about them more--
       Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,
     And saw his agonies with such sublimity,
     That all the world exclaim'd, 'What magnanimity!'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     No doubt this patience, when the world is damning us,
       Is philosophic in our former friends;
     'T is also pleasant to be deem'd magnanimous,
       The more so in obtaining our own ends;
     And what the lawyers call a 'malus animus'
       Conduct like this by no means comprehends;
     Revenge in person 's certainly no virtue,
     But then 't is not my fault, if others hurt you.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And if your quarrels should rip up old stories,
       And help them with a lie or two additional,
     I 'm not to blame, as you well know--no more is
       Any one else--they were become traditional;
     Besides, their resurrection aids our glories
       By contrast, which is what we just were wishing all:
     And science profits by this resurrection--
     Dead scandals form good subjects for dissection.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Their friends had tried at reconciliation,
       Then their relations, who made matters worse.
     ('T were hard to tell upon a like occasion
       To whom it may be best to have recourse--
     I can't say much for friend or yet relation):
       The lawyers did their utmost for divorce,
     But scarce a fee was paid on either side
     Before, unluckily, Don Jose died.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He died: and most unluckily, because,
       According to all hints I could collect
     From counsel learned in those kinds of laws
       (Although their talk 's obscure and circumspect),
     His death contrived to spoil a charming cause;
       A thousand pities also with respect
     To public feeling, which on this occasion
     Was manifested in a great sensation.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But, ah! he died; and buried with him lay
       The public feeling and the lawyers' fees:
     His house was sold, his servants sent away,
       A Jew took one of his two mistresses,
     A priest the other--at least so they say:
       I ask'd the doctors after his disease--
     He died of the slow fever call'd the tertian,
     And left his widow to her own aversion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet Jose was an honourable man,
       That I must say who knew him very well;
     Therefore his frailties I 'll no further scan
       Indeed there were not many more to tell;
     And if his passions now and then outran
       Discretion, and were not so peaceable
     As Numa's (who was also named Pompilius),
     He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Whate'er might be his worthlessness or worth,
       Poor fellow! he had many things to wound him.
     Let 's own--since it can do no good on earth--
       It was a trying moment that which found him
     Standing alone beside his desolate hearth,
       Where all his household gods lay shiver'd round him:
     No choice was left his feelings or his pride,
     Save death or Doctors' Commons--so he died.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Dying intestate, Juan was sole heir
       To a chancery suit, and messuages, and lands,
     Which, with a long minority and care,
       Promised to turn out well in proper hands:
     Inez became sole guardian, which was fair,
       And answer'd but to nature's just demands;
     An only son left with an only mother
     Is brought up much more wisely than another.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Sagest of women, even of widows, she
       Resolved that Juan should be quite a paragon,
     And worthy of the noblest pedigree
       (His sire was of Castile, his dam from Aragon):
     Then for accomplishments of chivalry,
       In case our lord the king should go to war again,
     He learn'd the arts of riding, fencing, gunnery,
     And how to scale a fortress--or a nunnery.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But that which Donna Inez most desired,
       And saw into herself each day before all
     The learned tutors whom for him she hired,
       Was, that his breeding should be strictly moral;
     Much into all his studies she inquired,
       And so they were submitted first to her, all,
     Arts, sciences, no branch was made a mystery
     To Juan's eyes, excepting natural history.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The languages, especially the dead,
       The sciences, and most of all the abstruse,
     The arts, at least all such as could be said
       To be the most remote from common use,
     In all these he was much and deeply read;
       But not a page of any thing that 's loose,
     Or hints continuation of the species,
     Was ever suffer'd, lest he should grow vicious.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     His classic studies made a little puzzle,
       Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,
     Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,
       But never put on pantaloons or bodices;
     His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,
       And for their AEneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,
     Were forced to make an odd sort! of apology,
     For Donna Inez dreaded the Mythology.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Ovid 's a rake, as half his verses show him,
       Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,
     Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,
       I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,
     Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn
       Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:
     But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one
     Beginning with 'Formosum Pastor Corydon.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Lucretius' irreligion is too strong,
       For early stomachs, to prove wholesome food;
     I can't help thinking Juvenal was wrong,
       Although no doubt his real intent was good,
     For speaking out so plainly in his song,
       So much indeed as to be downright rude;
     And then what proper person can be partial
     To all those nauseous epigrams of Martial?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan was taught from out the best edition,
       Expurgated by learned men, who place
     Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision,
       The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface
     Too much their modest bard by this omission,
       And pitying sore his mutilated case,
     They only add them all in an appendix,
     Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index;

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For there we have them all 'at one fell swoop,'
       Instead of being scatter'd through the Pages;
     They stand forth marshall'd in a handsome troop,
       To meet the ingenuous youth of future ages,
     Till some less rigid editor shall stoop
       To call them back into their separate cages,
     Instead of standing staring all together,
     Like garden gods--and not so decent either.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The Missal too (it was the family Missal)
       Was ornamented in a sort of way
     Which ancient mass-books often are, and this all
       Kinds of grotesques illumined; and how they,
     Who saw those figures on the margin kiss all,
       Could turn their optics to the text and pray,
     Is more than I know--But Don Juan's mother
     Kept this herself, and gave her son another.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Sermons he read, and lectures he endured,
       And homilies, and lives of all the saints;
     To Jerome and to Chrysostom inured,
       He did not take such studies for restraints;
     But how faith is acquired, and then ensured,
       So well not one of the aforesaid paints
     As Saint Augustine in his fine Confessions,
     Which make the reader envy his transgressions.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This, too, was a seal'd book to little Juan--
       I can't but say that his mamma was right,
     If such an education was the true one.
       She scarcely trusted him from out her sight;
     Her maids were old, and if she took a new one,
       You might be sure she was a perfect fright;
     She did this during even her husband's life--
     I recommend as much to every wife.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Young Juan wax'd in goodliness and grace;
       At six a charming child, and at eleven
     With all the promise of as fine a face
       As e'er to man's maturer growth was given:
     He studied steadily, and grew apace,
       And seem'd, at least, in the right road to heaven,
     For half his days were pass'd at church, the other
     Between his tutors, confessor, and mother.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     At six, I said, he was a charming child,
       At twelve he was a fine, but quiet boy;
     Although in infancy a little wild,
       They tamed him down amongst them: to destroy
     His natural spirit not in vain they toil'd,
       At least it seem'd so; and his mother's joy
     Was to declare how sage, and still, and steady,
     Her young philosopher was grown already.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I had my doubts, perhaps I have them still,
       But what I say is neither here nor there:
     I knew his father well, and have some skill
       In character--but it would not be fair
     From sire to son to augur good or ill:
       He and his wife were an ill-sorted pair--
     But scandal 's my aversion--I protest
     Against all evil speaking, even in jest.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For my part I say nothing--nothing--but
       This I will say--my reasons are my own--
     That if I had an only son to put
       To school (as God be praised that I have none),
     'T is not with Donna Inez I would shut
       Him up to learn his catechism alone,
     No--no--I 'd send him out betimes to college,
     For there it was I pick'd up my own knowledge.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For there one learns--'t is not for me to boast,
       Though I acquired--but I pass over that,
     As well as all the Greek I since have lost:
       I say that there 's the place--but 'Verbum sat.'
     I think I pick'd up too, as well as most,
       Knowledge of matters--but no matter what--
     I never married--but, I think, I know
     That sons should not be educated so.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Young Juan now was sixteen years of age,
       Tall, handsome, slender, but well knit: he seem'd
     Active, though not so sprightly, as a page;
       And everybody but his mother deem'd
     Him almost man; but she flew in a rage
       And bit her lips (for else she might have scream'd)
     If any said so, for to be precocious
     Was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Amongst her numerous acquaintance, all
       Selected for discretion and devotion,
     There was the Donna Julia, whom to call
       Pretty were but to give a feeble notion
     Of many charms in her as natural
       As sweetness to the flower, or salt to ocean,
     Her zone to Venus, or his bow to Cupid
     (But this last simile is trite and stupid).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The darkness of her Oriental eye
       Accorded with her Moorish origin
     (Her blood was not all Spanish, by the by;
       In Spain, you know, this is a sort of sin);
     When proud Granada fell, and, forced to fly,
       Boabdil wept, of Donna Julia's kin
     Some went to Africa, some stay'd in Spain,
     Her great-great-grandmamma chose to remain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She married (I forget the pedigree)
       With an Hidalgo, who transmitted down
     His blood less noble than such blood should be;
       At such alliances his sires would frown,
     In that point so precise in each degree
       That they bred in and in, as might be shown,
     Marrying their cousins--nay, their aunts, and nieces,
     Which always spoils the breed, if it increases.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This heathenish cross restored the breed again,
       Ruin'd its blood, but much improved its flesh;
     For from a root the ugliest in Old Spain
       Sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh;
     The sons no more were short, the daughters plain:
       But there 's a rumour which I fain would hush,
     'T is said that Donna Julia's grandmamma
     Produced her Don more heirs at love than law.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     However this might be, the race went on
       Improving still through every generation,
     Until it centred in an only son,
       Who left an only daughter; my narration
     May have suggested that this single one
       Could be but Julia (whom on this occasion
     I shall have much to speak about), and she
     Was married, charming, chaste, and twenty-three.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her eye (I 'm very fond of handsome eyes)
       Was large and dark, suppressing half its fire
     Until she spoke, then through its soft disguise
       Flash'd an expression more of pride than ire,
     And love than either; and there would arise
       A something in them which was not desire,
     But would have been, perhaps, but for the soul
     Which struggled through and chasten'd down the whole.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her glossy hair was cluster'd o'er a brow
       Bright with intelligence, and fair, and smooth;
     Her eyebrow's shape was like th' aerial bow,
       Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,
     Mounting at times to a transparent glow,
       As if her veins ran lightning; she, in sooth,
     Possess'd an air and grace by no means common:
     Her stature tall--I hate a dumpy woman.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Wedded she was some years, and to a man
       Of fifty, and such husbands are in plenty;
     And yet, I think, instead of such a ONE
       'T were better to have TWO of five-and-twenty,
     Especially in countries near the sun:
       And now I think on 't, 'mi vien in mente,'
     Ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
     Prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is a sad thing, I cannot choose but say,
       And all the fault of that indecent sun,
     Who cannot leave alone our helpless clay,
       But will keep baking, broiling, burning on,
     That howsoever people fast and pray,
       The flesh is frail, and so the soul undone:
     What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,
     Is much more common where the climate 's sultry.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Happy the nations of the moral North!
       Where all is virtue, and the winter season
     Sends sin, without a rag on, shivering forth
       ('T was snow that brought St. Anthony to reason);
     Where juries cast up what a wife is worth,
       By laying whate'er sum in mulct they please on
     The lover, who must pay a handsome price,
     Because it is a marketable vice.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alfonso was the name of Julia's lord,
       A man well looking for his years, and who
     Was neither much beloved nor yet abhorr'd:
       They lived together, as most people do,
     Suffering each other's foibles by accord,
       And not exactly either one or two;
     Yet he was jealous, though he did not show it,
     For jealousy dislikes the world to know it.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Julia was--yet I never could see why--
       With Donna Inez quite a favourite friend;
     Between their tastes there was small sympathy,
       For not a line had Julia ever penn'd:
     Some people whisper but no doubt they lie,
       For malice still imputes some private end,
     That Inez had, ere Don Alfonso's marriage,
     Forgot with him her very prudent carriage;

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And that still keeping up the old connection,
       Which time had lately render'd much more chaste,
     She took his lady also in affection,
       And certainly this course was much the best:
     She flatter'd Julia with her sage protection,
       And complimented Don Alfonso's taste;
     And if she could not (who can?) silence scandal,
     At least she left it a more slender handle.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I can't tell whether Julia saw the affair
       With other people's eyes, or if her own
     Discoveries made, but none could be aware
       Of this, at least no symptom e'er was shown;
     Perhaps she did not know, or did not care,
       Indifferent from the first or callous grown:
     I 'm really puzzled what to think or say,
     She kept her counsel in so close a way.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan she saw, and, as a pretty child,
       Caress'd him often--such a thing might be
     Quite innocently done, and harmless styled,
       When she had twenty years, and thirteen he;
     But I am not so sure I should have smiled
       When he was sixteen, Julia twenty-three;
     These few short years make wondrous alterations,
     Particularly amongst sun-burnt nations.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Whate'er the cause might be, they had become
       Changed; for the dame grew distant, the youth shy,
     Their looks cast down, their greetings almost dumb,
       And much embarrassment in either eye;
     There surely will be little doubt with some
       That Donna Julia knew the reason why,
     But as for Juan, he had no more notion
     Than he who never saw the sea of ocean.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind,
       And tremulously gentle her small hand
     Withdrew itself from his, but left behind
       A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland
     And slight, so very slight, that to the mind
       'T was but a doubt; but ne'er magician's wand
     Wrought change with all Armida's fairy art
     Like what this light touch left on Juan's heart.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And if she met him, though she smiled no more,
       She look'd a sadness sweeter than her smile,
     As if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
       She must not own, but cherish'd more the while
     For that compression in its burning core;
       Even innocence itself has many a wile,
     And will not dare to trust itself with truth,
     And love is taught hypocrisy from youth.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But passion most dissembles, yet betrays
       Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky
     Foretells the heaviest tempest, it displays
       Its workings through the vainly guarded eye,
     And in whatever aspect it arrays
       Itself, 't is still the same hypocrisy;
     Coldness or anger, even disdain or hate,
     Are masks it often wears, and still too late.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression,
       And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft,
     And burning blushes, though for no transgression,
       Tremblings when met, and restlessness when left;
     All these are little preludes to possession,
       Of which young passion cannot be bereft,
     And merely tend to show how greatly love is
     Embarrass'd at first starting with a novice.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Poor Julia's heart was in an awkward state;
       She felt it going, and resolved to make
     The noblest efforts for herself and mate,
       For honour's, pride's, religion's, virtue's sake;
     Her resolutions were most truly great,
       And almost might have made a Tarquin quake:
     She pray'd the Virgin Mary for her grace,
     As being the best judge of a lady's case.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She vow'd she never would see Juan more,
       And next day paid a visit to his mother,
     And look'd extremely at the opening door,
       Which, by the Virgin's grace, let in another;
     Grateful she was, and yet a little sore--
       Again it opens, it can be no other,
     'T is surely Juan now--No! I 'm afraid
     That night the Virgin was no further pray'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She now determined that a virtuous woman
       Should rather face and overcome temptation,
     That flight was base and dastardly, and no man
       Should ever give her heart the least sensation;
     That is to say, a thought beyond the common
       Preference, that we must feel upon occasion
     For people who are pleasanter than others,
     But then they only seem so many brothers.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And even if by chance--and who can tell?
       The devil 's so very sly--she should discover
     That all within was not so very well,
       And, if still free, that such or such a lover
     Might please perhaps, a virtuous wife can quell
       Such thoughts, and be the better when they 're over;
     And if the man should ask, 't is but denial:
     I recommend young ladies to make trial.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then there are such things as love divine,
       Bright and immaculate, unmix'd and pure,
     Such as the angels think so very fine,
       And matrons who would be no less secure,
     Platonic, perfect, 'just such love as mine;'
       Thus Julia said--and thought so, to be sure;
     And so I 'd have her think, were I the man
     On whom her reveries celestial ran.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Such love is innocent, and may exist
       Between young persons without any danger.
     A hand may first, and then a lip be kist;
       For my part, to such doings I 'm a stranger,
     But hear these freedoms form the utmost list
       Of all o'er which such love may be a ranger:
     If people go beyond, 't is quite a crime,
     But not my fault--I tell them all in time.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Love, then, but love within its proper limits,
       Was Julia's innocent determination
     In young Don Juan's favour, and to him its
       Exertion might be useful on occasion;
     And, lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
       Ethereal lustre, with what sweet persuasion
     He might be taught, by love and her together--
     I really don't know what, nor Julia either.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Fraught with this fine intention, and well fenced
       In mail of proof--her purity of soul--
     She, for the future of her strength convinced.
       And that her honour was a rock, or mole,
     Exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
       With any kind of troublesome control;
     But whether Julia to the task was equal
     Is that which must be mention'd in the sequel.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her plan she deem'd both innocent and feasible,
       And, surely, with a stripling of sixteen
     Not scandal's fangs could fix on much that 's seizable,
       Or if they did so, satisfied to mean
     Nothing but what was good, her breast was peaceable--
       A quiet conscience makes one so serene!
     Christians have burnt each other, quite persuaded
     That all the Apostles would have done as they did.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And if in the mean time her husband died,
       But Heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
     Her brain, though in a dream! (and then she sigh'd)
       Never could she survive that common loss;
     But just suppose that moment should betide,
       I only say suppose it--inter nos.
     (This should be entre nous, for Julia thought
     In French, but then the rhyme would go for naught.)

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I only say suppose this supposition:
       Juan being then grown up to man's estate
     Would fully suit a widow of condition,
       Even seven years hence it would not be too late;
     And in the interim (to pursue this vision)
       The mischief, after all, could not be great,
     For he would learn the rudiments of love,
     I mean the seraph way of those above.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     So much for Julia. Now we 'll turn to Juan.
       Poor little fellow! he had no idea
     Of his own case, and never hit the true one;
       In feelings quick as Ovid's Miss Medea,
     He puzzled over what he found a new one,
       But not as yet imagined it could be
     Thing quite in course, and not at all alarming,
     Which, with a little patience, might grow charming.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Silent and pensive, idle, restless, slow,
       His home deserted for the lonely wood,
     Tormented with a wound he could not know,
       His, like all deep grief, plunged in solitude:
     I 'm fond myself of solitude or so,
       But then, I beg it may be understood,
     By solitude I mean a sultan's, not
     A hermit's, with a haram for a grot.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Oh Love! in such a wilderness as this,
       Where transport and security entwine,
     Here is the empire of thy perfect bliss,
       And here thou art a god indeed divine.'
     The bard I quote from does not sing amiss,
       With the exception of the second line,
     For that same twining 'transport and security'
     Are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The poet meant, no doubt, and thus appeals
       To the good sense and senses of mankind,
     The very thing which every body feels,
       As all have found on trial, or may find,
     That no one likes to be disturb'd at meals
       Or love.--I won't say more about 'entwined'
     Or 'transport,' as we knew all that before,
     But beg 'Security' will bolt the door.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Young Juan wander'd by the glassy brooks,
       Thinking unutterable things; he threw
     Himself at length within the leafy nooks
       Where the wild branch of the cork forest grew;
     There poets find materials for their books,
       And every now and then we read them through,
     So that their plan and prosody are eligible,
     Unless, like Wordsworth, they prove unintelligible.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He, Juan (and not Wordsworth), so pursued
       His self-communion with his own high soul,
     Until his mighty heart, in its great mood,
       Had mitigated part, though not the whole
     Of its disease; he did the best he could
       With things not very subject to control,
     And turn'd, without perceiving his condition,
     Like Coleridge, into a metaphysician.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He thought about himself, and the whole earth
       Of man the wonderful, and of the stars,
     And how the deuce they ever could have birth;
       And then he thought of earthquakes, and of wars,
     How many miles the moon might have in girth,
       Of air-balloons, and of the many bars
     To perfect knowledge of the boundless skies;--
     And then he thought of Donna Julia's eyes.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
       Longings sublime, and aspirations high,
     Which some are born with, but the most part learn
       To plague themselves withal, they know not why:
     'T was strange that one so young should thus concern
       His brain about the action of the sky;
     If you think 't was philosophy that this did,
     I can't help thinking puberty assisted.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He pored upon the leaves, and on the flowers,
       And heard a voice in all the winds; and then
     He thought of wood-nymphs and immortal bowers,
       And how the goddesses came down to men:
     He miss'd the pathway, he forgot the hours,
       And when he look'd upon his watch again,
     He found how much old Time had been a winner--
     He also found that he had lost his dinner.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Sometimes he turn'd to gaze upon his book,
       Boscan, or Garcilasso;--by the wind
     Even as the page is rustled while we look,
       So by the poesy of his own mind
     Over the mystic leaf his soul was shook,
       As if 't were one whereon magicians bind
     Their spells, and give them to the passing gale,
     According to some good old woman's tale.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thus would he while his lonely hours away
       Dissatisfied, nor knowing what he wanted;
     Nor glowing reverie, nor poet's lay,
       Could yield his spirit that for which it panted,
     A bosom whereon he his head might lay,
       And hear the heart beat with the love it granted,
     With--several other things, which I forget,
     Or which, at least, I need not mention yet.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Those lonely walks, and lengthening reveries,
       Could not escape the gentle Julia's eyes;
     She saw that Juan was not at his ease;
       But that which chiefly may, and must surprise,
     Is, that the Donna Inez did not tease
       Her only son with question or surmise:
     Whether it was she did not see, or would not,
     Or, like all very clever people, could not.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This may seem strange, but yet 't is very common;
       For instance--gentlemen, whose ladies take
     Leave to o'erstep the written rights of woman,
       And break the--Which commandment is 't they break?
     (I have forgot the number, and think no man
       Should rashly quote, for fear of a mistake.)
     I say, when these same gentlemen are jealous,
     They make some blunder, which their ladies tell us.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A real husband always is suspicious,
       But still no less suspects in the wrong place,
     Jealous of some one who had no such wishes,
       Or pandering blindly to his own disgrace,
     By harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious;
       The last indeed 's infallibly the case:
     And when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly,
     He wonders at their vice, and not his folly.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thus parents also are at times short-sighted;
       Though watchful as the lynx, they ne'er discover,
     The while the wicked world beholds delighted,
       Young Hopeful's mistress, or Miss Fanny's lover,
     Till some confounded escapade has blighted
       The plan of twenty years, and all is over;
     And then the mother cries, the father swears,
     And wonders why the devil he got heirs.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Inez was so anxious, and so clear
       Of sight, that I must think, on this occasion,
     She had some other motive much more near
       For leaving Juan to this new temptation;
     But what that motive was, I sha'n't say here;
       Perhaps to finish Juan's education,
     Perhaps to open Don Alfonso's eyes,
     In case he thought his wife too great a prize.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It was upon a day, a summer's day;-
       Summer's indeed a very dangerous season,
     And so is spring about the end of May;
       The sun, no doubt, is the prevailing reason;
     But whatsoe'er the cause is, one may say,
       And stand convicted of more truth than treason,
     That there are months which nature grows more merry in,--
     March has its hares, and May must have its heroine.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was on a summer's day--the sixth of June:--
       I like to be particular in dates,
     Not only of the age, and year, but moon;
       They are a sort of post-house, where the Fates
     Change horses, making history change its tune,
       Then spur away o'er empires and o'er states,
     Leaving at last not much besides chronology,
     Excepting the post-obits of theology.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was on the sixth of June, about the hour
       Of half-past six--perhaps still nearer seven--
     When Julia sate within as pretty a bower
       As e'er held houri in that heathenish heaven
     Described by Mahomet, and Anacreon Moore,
       To whom the lyre and laurels have been given,
     With all the trophies of triumphant song--
     He won them well, and may he wear them long!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She sate, but not alone; I know not well
       How this same interview had taken place,
     And even if I knew, I should not tell--
       People should hold their tongues in any case;
     No matter how or why the thing befell,
       But there were she and Juan, face to face--
     When two such faces are so, 't would be wise,
     But very difficult, to shut their eyes.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     How beautiful she look'd! her conscious heart
       Glow'd in her cheek, and yet she felt no wrong.
     O Love! how perfect is thy mystic art,
       Strengthening the weak, and trampling on the strong,
     How self-deceitful is the sagest part
       Of mortals whom thy lure hath led along--
     The precipice she stood on was immense,
     So was her creed in her own innocence.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She thought of her own strength, and Juan's youth,
       And of the folly of all prudish fears,
     Victorious virtue, and domestic truth,
       And then of Don Alfonso's fifty years:
     I wish these last had not occurr'd, in sooth,
       Because that number rarely much endears,
     And through all climes, the snowy and the sunny,
     Sounds ill in love, whate'er it may in money.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     When people say, 'I've told you fifty times,'
       They mean to scold, and very often do;
     When poets say, 'I've written fifty rhymes,'
       They make you dread that they 'll recite them too;
     In gangs of fifty, thieves commit their crimes;
       At fifty love for love is rare, 't is true,
     But then, no doubt, it equally as true is,
     A good deal may be bought for fifty Louis.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Julia had honour, virtue, truth, and love,
       For Don Alfonso; and she inly swore,
     By all the vows below to powers above,
       She never would disgrace the ring she wore,
     Nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove;
       And while she ponder'd this, besides much more,
     One hand on Juan's carelessly was thrown,
     Quite by mistake--she thought it was her own;

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Unconsciously she lean'd upon the other,
       Which play'd within the tangles of her hair:
     And to contend with thoughts she could not smother
       She seem'd by the distraction of her air.
     'T was surely very wrong in Juan's mother
       To leave together this imprudent pair,
     She who for many years had watch'd her son so--
     I 'm very certain mine would not have done so.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The hand which still held Juan's, by degrees
       Gently, but palpably confirm'd its grasp,
     As if it said, 'Detain me, if you please;'
       Yet there 's no doubt she only meant to clasp
     His fingers with a pure Platonic squeeze:
       She would have shrunk as from a toad, or asp,
     Had she imagined such a thing could rouse
     A feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I cannot know what Juan thought of this,
       But what he did, is much what you would do;
     His young lip thank'd it with a grateful kiss,
       And then, abash'd at its own joy, withdrew
     In deep despair, lest he had done amiss,--
       Love is so very timid when 't is new:
     She blush'd, and frown'd not, but she strove to speak,
     And held her tongue, her voice was grown so weak.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The sun set, and up rose the yellow moon:
       The devil 's in the moon for mischief; they
     Who call'd her CHASTE, methinks, began too soon
       Their nomenclature; there is not a day,
     The longest, not the twenty-first of June,
       Sees half the business in a wicked way
     On which three single hours of moonshine smile--
     And then she looks so modest all the while.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There is a dangerous silence in that hour,
       A stillness, which leaves room for the full soul
     To open all itself, without the power
       Of calling wholly back its self-control;
     The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,
       Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,
     Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws
     A loving languor, which is not repose.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Julia sate with Juan, half embraced
       And half retiring from the glowing arm,
     Which trembled like the bosom where 't was placed;
       Yet still she must have thought there was no harm,
     Or else 't were easy to withdraw her waist;
       But then the situation had its charm,
     And then--God knows what next--I can't go on;
     I 'm almost sorry that I e'er begun.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O Plato! Plato! you have paved the way,
       With your confounded fantasies, to more
     Immoral conduct by the fancied sway
       Your system feigns o'er the controulless core
     Of human hearts, than all the long array
       Of poets and romancers:--You 're a bore,
     A charlatan, a coxcomb--and have been,
     At best, no better than a go-between.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Julia's voice was lost, except in sighs,
       Until too late for useful conversation;
     The tears were gushing from her gentle eyes,
       I wish indeed they had not had occasion,
     But who, alas! can love, and then be wise?
       Not that remorse did not oppose temptation;
     A little still she strove, and much repented
     And whispering 'I will ne'er consent'--consented.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is said that Xerxes offer'd a reward
       To those who could invent him a new pleasure:
     Methinks the requisition 's rather hard,
       And must have cost his majesty a treasure:
     For my part, I 'm a moderate-minded bard,
       Fond of a little love (which I call leisure);
     I care not for new pleasures, as the old
     Are quite enough for me, so they but hold.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O Pleasure! you are indeed a pleasant thing,
       Although one must be damn'd for you, no doubt:
     I make a resolution every spring
       Of reformation, ere the year run out,
     But somehow, this my vestal vow takes wing,
       Yet still, I trust it may be kept throughout:
     I 'm very sorry, very much ashamed,
     And mean, next winter, to be quite reclaim'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Here my chaste Muse a liberty must take--
       Start not! still chaster reader--she 'll be nice hence--
     Forward, and there is no great cause to quake;
       This liberty is a poetic licence,
     Which some irregularity may make
       In the design, and as I have a high sense
     Of Aristotle and the Rules, 't is fit
     To beg his pardon when I err a bit.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This licence is to hope the reader will
       Suppose from June the sixth (the fatal day,
     Without whose epoch my poetic skill
       For want of facts would all be thrown away),
     But keeping Julia and Don Juan still
       In sight, that several months have pass'd; we 'll say
     'T was in November, but I 'm not so sure
     About the day--the era 's more obscure.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     We 'll talk of that anon.--'T is sweet to hear
       At midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
     The song and oar of Adria's gondolier,
       By distance mellow'd, o'er the waters sweep;
     'T is sweet to see the evening star appear;
       'T is sweet to listen as the night-winds creep
     From leaf to leaf; 't is sweet to view on high
     The rainbow, based on ocean, span the sky.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark
       Bay deep-mouth'd welcome as we draw near home;
     'T is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
       Our coming, and look brighter when we come;
     'T is sweet to be awaken'd by the lark,
       Or lull'd by falling waters; sweet the hum
     Of bees, the voice of girls, the song of birds,
     The lisp of children, and their earliest words.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Sweet is the vintage, when the showering grapes
       In Bacchanal profusion reel to earth,
     Purple and gushing: sweet are our escapes
       From civic revelry to rural mirth;
     Sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps,
       Sweet to the father is his first-born's birth,
     Sweet is revenge--especially to women,
     Pillage to soldiers, prize-money to seamen.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Sweet is a legacy, and passing sweet
       The unexpected death of some old lady
     Or gentleman of seventy years complete,
       Who 've made 'us youth' wait too--too long already
     For an estate, or cash, or country seat,
       Still breaking, but with stamina so steady
     That all the Israelites are fit to mob its
     Next owner for their double-damn'd post-obits.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is sweet to win, no matter how, one's laurels,
       By blood or ink; 't is sweet to put an end
     To strife; 't is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels,
       Particularly with a tiresome friend:
     Sweet is old wine in bottles, ale in barrels;
       Dear is the helpless creature we defend
     Against the world; and dear the schoolboy spot
     We ne'er forget, though there we are forgot.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But sweeter still than this, than these, than all,
       Is first and passionate love--it stands alone,
     Like Adam's recollection of his fall;
       The tree of knowledge has been pluck'd--all 's known--
     And life yields nothing further to recall
       Worthy of this ambrosial sin, so shown,
     No doubt in fable, as the unforgiven
     Fire which Prometheus filch'd for us from heaven.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Man 's a strange animal, and makes strange use
       Of his own nature, and the various arts,
     And likes particularly to produce
       Some new experiment to show his parts;
     This is the age of oddities let loose,
       Where different talents find their different marts;
     You 'd best begin with truth, and when you 've lost your
     Labour, there 's a sure market for imposture.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     What opposite discoveries we have seen!
       (Signs of true genius, and of empty pockets.)
     One makes new noses, one a guillotine,
       One breaks your bones, one sets them in their sockets;
     But vaccination certainly has been
       A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets,
     With which the Doctor paid off an old pox,
     By borrowing a new one from an ox.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Bread has been made (indifferent) from potatoes;
       And galvanism has set some corpses grinning,
     But has not answer'd like the apparatus
       Of the Humane Society's beginning
     By which men are unsuffocated gratis:
       What wondrous new machines have late been spinning!
     I said the small-pox has gone out of late;
     Perhaps it may be follow'd by the great.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is said the great came from America;
       Perhaps it may set out on its return,--
     The population there so spreads, they say
       'T is grown high time to thin it in its turn,
     With war, or plague, or famine, any way,
       So that civilisation they may learn;
     And which in ravage the more loathsome evil is--
     Their real lues, or our pseudo-syphilis?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This is the patent-age of new inventions
       For killing bodies, and for saving souls,
     All propagated with the best intentions;
       Sir Humphry Davy's lantern, by which coals
     Are safely mined for in the mode he mentions,
       Tombuctoo travels, voyages to the Poles,
     Are ways to benefit mankind, as true,
     Perhaps, as shooting them at Waterloo.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Man 's a phenomenon, one knows not what,
       And wonderful beyond all wondrous measure;
     'T is pity though, in this sublime world, that
       Pleasure 's a sin, and sometimes sin 's a pleasure;
     Few mortals know what end they would be at,
       But whether glory, power, or love, or treasure,
     The path is through perplexing ways, and when
     The goal is gain'd, we die, you know--and then--

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     What then?--I do not know, no more do you--
       And so good night.--Return we to our story:
     'T was in November, when fine days are few,
       And the far mountains wax a little hoary,
     And clap a white cape on their mantles blue;
       And the sea dashes round the promontory,
     And the loud breaker boils against the rock,
     And sober suns must set at five o'clock.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was, as the watchmen say, a cloudy night;
       No moon, no stars, the wind was low or loud
     By gusts, and many a sparkling hearth was bright
       With the piled wood, round which the family crowd;
     There 's something cheerful in that sort of light,
       Even as a summer sky 's without a cloud:
     I 'm fond of fire, and crickets, and all that,
     A lobster salad, and champagne, and chat.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was midnight--Donna Julia was in bed,
       Sleeping, most probably,--when at her door
     Arose a clatter might awake the dead,
       If they had never been awoke before,
     And that they have been so we all have read,
       And are to be so, at the least, once more;--
     The door was fasten'd, but with voice and fist
     First knocks were heard, then 'Madam--Madam--hist!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'For God's sake, Madam--Madam--here 's my master,
       With more than half the city at his back--
     Was ever heard of such a curst disaster!
       'T is not my fault--I kept good watch--Alack!
     Do pray undo the bolt a little faster--
       They 're on the stair just now, and in a crack
     Will all be here; perhaps he yet may fly--
     Surely the window 's not so very high!'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     By this time Don Alfonso was arrived,
       With torches, friends, and servants in great number;
     The major part of them had long been wived,
       And therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
     Of any wicked woman, who contrived
       By stealth her husband's temples to encumber:
     Examples of this kind are so contagious,
     Were one not punish'd, all would be outrageous.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I can't tell how, or why, or what suspicion
       Could enter into Don Alfonso's head;
     But for a cavalier of his condition
       It surely was exceedingly ill-bred,
     Without a word of previous admonition,
       To hold a levee round his lady's bed,
     And summon lackeys, arm'd with fire and sword,
     To prove himself the thing he most abhorr'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Poor Donna Julia, starting as from sleep
       (Mind--that I do not say--she had not slept),
     Began at once to scream, and yawn, and weep;
       Her maid Antonia, who was an adept,
     Contrived to fling the bed-clothes in a heap,
       As if she had just now from out them crept:
     I can't tell why she should take all this trouble
     To prove her mistress had been sleeping double.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Julia mistress, and Antonia maid,
       Appear'd like two poor harmless women, who
     Of goblins, but still more of men afraid,
       Had thought one man might be deterr'd by two,
     And therefore side by side were gently laid,
       Until the hours of absence should run through,
     And truant husband should return, and say,
     'My dear, I was the first who came away.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now Julia found at length a voice, and cried,
       'In heaven's name, Don Alfonso, what d' ye mean?
     Has madness seized you? would that I had died
       Ere such a monster's victim I had been!
     What may this midnight violence betide,
       A sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen?
     Dare you suspect me, whom the thought would kill?
     Search, then, the room!'--Alfonso said, 'I will.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He search'd, they search'd, and rummaged everywhere,
       Closet and clothes' press, chest and window-seat,
     And found much linen, lace, and several pair
       Of stockings, slippers, brushes, combs, complete,
     With other articles of ladies fair,
       To keep them beautiful, or leave them neat:
     Arras they prick'd and curtains with their swords,
     And wounded several shutters, and some boards.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Under the bed they search'd, and there they found--
       No matter what--it was not that they sought;
     They open'd windows, gazing if the ground
       Had signs or footmarks, but the earth said nought;
     And then they stared each other's faces round:
       'T is odd, not one of all these seekers thought,
     And seems to me almost a sort of blunder,
     Of looking in the bed as well as under.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     During this inquisition, Julia's tongue
       Was not asleep--'Yes, search and search,' she cried,
     'Insult on insult heap, and wrong on wrong!
       It was for this that I became a bride!
     For this in silence I have suffer'd long
       A husband like Alfonso at my side;
     But now I 'll bear no more, nor here remain,
     If there be law or lawyers in all Spain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Yes, Don Alfonso! husband now no more,
       If ever you indeed deserved the name,
     Is 't worthy of your years?--you have threescore--
       Fifty, or sixty, it is all the same--
     Is 't wise or fitting, causeless to explore
       For facts against a virtuous woman's fame?
     Ungrateful, perjured, barbarous Don Alfonso,
     How dare you think your lady would go on so?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Is it for this I have disdain'd to hold
       The common privileges of my sex?
     That I have chosen a confessor so old
       And deaf, that any other it would vex,
     And never once he has had cause to scold,
       But found my very innocence perplex
     So much, he always doubted I was married--
     How sorry you will be when I 've miscarried!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Was it for this that no Cortejo e'er
       I yet have chosen from out the youth of Seville?
     Is it for this I scarce went anywhere,
       Except to bull-fights, mass, play, rout, and revel?
     Is it for this, whate'er my suitors were,
       I favor'd none--nay, was almost uncivil?
     Is it for this that General Count O'Reilly,
     Who took Algiers, declares I used him vilely?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Did not the Italian Musico Cazzani
       Sing at my heart six months at least in vain?
     Did not his countryman, Count Corniani,
       Call me the only virtuous wife in Spain?
     Were there not also Russians, English, many?
       The Count Strongstroganoff I put in pain,
     And Lord Mount Coffeehouse, the Irish peer,
     Who kill'd himself for love (with wine) last year.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Have I not had two bishops at my feet,
       The Duke of Ichar, and Don Fernan Nunez?
     And is it thus a faithful wife you treat?
       I wonder in what quarter now the moon is:
     I praise your vast forbearance not to beat
       Me also, since the time so opportune is--
     O, valiant man! with sword drawn and cock'd trigger,
     Now, tell me, don't you cut a pretty figure?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Was it for this you took your sudden journey.
       Under pretence of business indispensable
     With that sublime of rascals your attorney,
       Whom I see standing there, and looking sensible
     Of having play'd the fool? though both I spurn, he
       Deserves the worst, his conduct 's less defensible,
     Because, no doubt, 't was for his dirty fee,
     And not from any love to you nor me.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'If he comes here to take a deposition,
       By all means let the gentleman proceed;
     You 've made the apartment in a fit condition:
       There 's pen and ink for you, sir, when you need--
     Let every thing be noted with precision,
       I would not you for nothing should be fee'd--
     But, as my maid 's undrest, pray turn your spies out.'
     'Oh!' sobb'd Antonia, 'I could tear their eyes out.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'There is the closet, there the toilet, there
       The antechamber--search them under, over;
     There is the sofa, there the great arm-chair,
       The chimney--which would really hold a lover.
     I wish to sleep, and beg you will take care
       And make no further noise, till you discover
     The secret cavern of this lurking treasure--

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'And now, Hidalgo! now that you have thrown

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'At least, perhaps, he has not sixty years,
       At that age he would be too old for slaughter,
     Or for so young a husband's jealous fears
       (Antonia! let me have a glass of water).
     I am ashamed of having shed these tears,
       They are unworthy of my father's daughter;
     My mother dream'd not in my natal hour
     That I should fall into a monster's power.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Perhaps 't is of Antonia you are jealous,
       You saw that she was sleeping by my side
     When you broke in upon us with your fellows:
       Look where you please--we 've nothing, sir, to hide;
     Only another time, I trust, you 'll tell us,
       Or for the sake of decency abide
     A moment at the door, that we may be
     Drest to receive so much good company.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'And now, sir, I have done, and say no more;
       The little I have said may serve to show
     The guileless heart in silence may grieve o'er
       The wrongs to whose exposure it is slow:
     I leave you to your conscience as before,
       'T will one day ask you why you used me so?
     God grant you feel not then the bitterest grief!-
     Antonia! where 's my pocket-handkerchief?'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She ceased, and turn'd upon her pillow; pale
       She lay, her dark eyes flashing through their tears,
     Like skies that rain and lighten; as a veil,
       Waved and o'ershading her wan cheek, appears
     Her streaming hair; the black curls strive, but fail,
       To hide the glossy shoulder, which uprears
     Its snow through all;--her soft lips lie apart,
     And louder than her breathing beats her heart.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The Senhor Don Alfonso stood confused;
       Antonia bustled round the ransack'd room,
     And, turning up her nose, with looks abused
       Her master and his myrmidons, of whom
     Not one, except the attorney, was amused;
       He, like Achates, faithful to the tomb,
     So there were quarrels, cared not for the cause,
     Knowing they must be settled by the laws.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     With prying snub-nose, and small eyes, he stood,
       Following Antonia's motions here and there,
     With much suspicion in his attitude;
       For reputations he had little care;
     So that a suit or action were made good,
       Small pity had he for the young and fair,
     And ne'er believed in negatives, till these
     Were proved by competent false witnesses.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Don Alfonso stood with downcast looks,
       And, truth to say, he made a foolish figure;
     When, after searching in five hundred nooks,
       And treating a young wife with so much rigour,
     He gain'd no point, except some self-rebukes,
       Added to those his lady with such vigour
     Had pour'd upon him for the last half-hour,
     Quick, thick, and heavy--as a thunder-shower.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     At first he tried to hammer an excuse,
       To which the sole reply was tears and sobs,
     And indications of hysterics, whose
       Prologue is always certain throes, and throbs,
     Gasps, and whatever else the owners choose:
       Alfonso saw his wife, and thought of Job's;
     He saw too, in perspective, her relations,
     And then he tried to muster all his patience.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He stood in act to speak, or rather stammer,
       But sage Antonia cut him short before
     The anvil of his speech received the hammer,
       With 'Pray, sir, leave the room, and say no more,
     Or madam dies.'--Alfonso mutter'd, 'D--n her,'
       But nothing else, the time of words was o'er;
     He cast a rueful look or two, and did,
     He knew not wherefore, that which he was bid.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     With him retired his 'posse comitatus,'
       The attorney last, who linger'd near the door
     Reluctantly, still tarrying there as late as
       Antonia let him--not a little sore
     At this most strange and unexplain'd 'hiatus'
       In Don Alfonso's facts, which just now wore
     An awkward look; as he revolved the case,
     The door was fasten'd in his legal face.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     No sooner was it bolted, than--Oh shame!
       O sin! Oh sorrow! and oh womankind!
     How can you do such things and keep your fame,
       Unless this world, and t' other too, be blind?
     Nothing so dear as an unfilch'd good name!
       But to proceed--for there is more behind:
     With much heartfelt reluctance be it said,
     Young Juan slipp'd half-smother'd, from the bed.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He had been hid--I don't pretend to say
       How, nor can I indeed describe the where--
     Young, slender, and pack'd easily, he lay,
       No doubt, in little compass, round or square;
     But pity him I neither must nor may
       His suffocation by that pretty pair;
     'T were better, sure, to die so, than be shut
     With maudlin Clarence in his Malmsey butt.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And, secondly, I pity not, because
       He had no business to commit a sin,
     Forbid by heavenly, fined by human laws,
       At least 't was rather early to begin;
     But at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
       So much as when we call our old debts in
     At sixty years, and draw the accompts of evil,
     And find a deuced balance with the devil.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Of his position I can give no notion:
       'T is written in the Hebrew Chronicle,
     How the physicians, leaving pill and potion,
       Prescribed, by way of blister, a young belle,
     When old King David's blood grew dull in motion,
       And that the medicine answer'd very well;
     Perhaps 't was in a different way applied,
     For David lived, but Juan nearly died.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     What 's to be done? Alfonso will be back
       The moment he has sent his fools away.
     Antonia's skill was put upon the rack,
       But no device could be brought into play--
     And how to parry the renew'd attack?
       Besides, it wanted but few hours of day:
     Antonia puzzled; Julia did not speak,
     But press'd her bloodless lip to Juan's cheek.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He turn'd his lip to hers, and with his hand
       Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair;
     Even then their love they could not all command,
       And half forgot their danger and despair:
     Antonia's patience now was at a stand--
       'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,'
     She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit
     This pretty gentleman within the closet:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Pray, keep your nonsense for some luckier night--
       Who can have put my master in this mood?
     What will become on 't--I 'm in such a fright,
       The devil 's in the urchin, and no good--
     Is this a time for giggling? this a plight?
       Why, don't you know that it may end in blood?
     You 'll lose your life, and I shall lose my place,
     My mistress all, for that half-girlish face.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Had it but been for a stout cavalier
       Of twenty-five or thirty (come, make haste)--
     But for a child, what piece of work is here!
       I really, madam, wonder at your taste
     (Come, sir, get in)--my master must be near:
       There, for the present, at the least, he's fast,
     And if we can but till the morning keep
     Our counsel--(Juan, mind, you must not sleep).'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now, Don Alfonso entering, but alone,
       Closed the oration of the trusty maid:
     She loiter'd, and he told her to be gone,
       An order somewhat sullenly obey'd;
     However, present remedy was none,
       And no great good seem'd answer'd if she stay'd:
     Regarding both with slow and sidelong view,
     She snuff'd the candle, curtsied, and withdrew.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alfonso paused a minute--then begun
       Some strange excuses for his late proceeding;
     He would not justify what he had done,
       To say the best, it was extreme ill-breeding;
     But there were ample reasons for it, none
       Of which he specified in this his pleading:
     His speech was a fine sample, on the whole,
     Of rhetoric, which the learn'd call 'rigmarole.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Julia said nought; though all the while there rose
       A ready answer, which at once enables
     A matron, who her husband's foible knows,
       By a few timely words to turn the tables,
     Which, if it does not silence, still must pose,--
       Even if it should comprise a pack of fables;
     'T is to retort with firmness, and when he
     Suspects with one, do you reproach with three.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Julia, in fact, had tolerable grounds,--
       Alfonso's loves with Inez were well known,
     But whether 't was that one's own guilt confounds--
       But that can't be, as has been often shown,
     A lady with apologies abounds;--
       It might be that her silence sprang alone
     From delicacy to Don Juan's ear,
     To whom she knew his mother's fame was dear.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There might be one more motive, which makes two;
       Alfonso ne'er to Juan had alluded,--
     Mention'd his jealousy but never who
       Had been the happy lover, he concluded,
     Conceal'd amongst his premises; 't is true,
       His mind the more o'er this its mystery brooded;
     To speak of Inez now were, one may say,
     Like throwing Juan in Alfonso's way.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A hint, in tender cases, is enough;
       Silence is best, besides there is a tact
     (That modern phrase appears to me sad stuff,
       But it will serve to keep my verse compact)-
     Which keeps, when push'd by questions rather rough,
       A lady always distant from the fact:
     The charming creatures lie with such a grace,
     There 's nothing so becoming to the face.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They blush, and we believe them; at least I
       Have always done so; 't is of no great use,
     In any case, attempting a reply,
       For then their eloquence grows quite profuse;
     And when at length they 're out of breath, they sigh,
       And cast their languid eyes down, and let loose
     A tear or two, and then we make it up;
     And then--and then--and then--sit down and sup.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alfonso closed his speech, and begg'd her pardon,
       Which Julia half withheld, and then half granted,
     And laid conditions he thought very hard on,
       Denying several little things he wanted:
     He stood like Adam lingering near his garden,
       With useless penitence perplex'd and haunted,
     Beseeching she no further would refuse,
     When, lo! he stumbled o'er a pair of shoes.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A pair of shoes!--what then? not much, if they
       Are such as fit with ladies' feet, but these
     (No one can tell how much I grieve to say)
       Were masculine; to see them, and to seize,
     Was but a moment's act.--Ah! well-a-day!
       My teeth begin to chatter, my veins freeze--
     Alfonso first examined well their fashion,
     And then flew out into another passion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He left the room for his relinquish'd sword,
       And Julia instant to the closet flew.
     'Fly, Juan, fly! for heaven's sake--not a word--
       The door is open--you may yet slip through
     The passage you so often have explored--
       Here is the garden-key--Fly--fly--Adieu!
     Haste--haste! I hear Alfonso's hurrying feet--
     Day has not broke--there 's no one in the street:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     None can say that this was not good advice,
       The only mischief was, it came too late;
     Of all experience 't is the usual price,
       A sort of income-tax laid on by fate:
     Juan had reach'd the room-door in a. trice,
       And might have done so by the garden-gate,
     But met Alfonso in his dressing-gown,
     Who threaten'd death--so Juan knock'd him down.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Dire was the scuffle, and out went the light;
       Antonia cried out 'Rape!' and Julia 'Fire!'
     But not a servant stirr'd to aid the fight.
       Alfonso, pommell'd to his heart's desire,
     Swore lustily he'd be revenged this night;
       And Juan, too, blasphemed an octave higher;
     His blood was up: though young, he was a Tartar,
     And not at all disposed to prove a martyr.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alfonso's sword had dropp'd ere he could draw it,
       And they continued battling hand to hand,
     For Juan very luckily ne'er saw it;
       His temper not being under great command,
     If at that moment he had chanced to claw it,
       Alfonso's days had not been in the land
     Much longer.--Think of husbands', lovers' lives!
     And how ye may be doubly widows--wives!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alfonso grappled to detain the foe,
       And Juan throttled him to get away,
     And blood ('t was from the nose) began to flow;
       At last, as they more faintly wrestling lay,
     Juan contrived to give an awkward blow,
       And then his only garment quite gave way;
     He fled, like Joseph, leaving it; but there,
     I doubt, all likeness ends between the pair.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Lights came at length, and men, and maids, who found
       An awkward spectacle their eyes before;
     Antonia in hysterics, Julia swoon'd,
       Alfonso leaning, breathless, by the door;
     Some half-torn drapery scatter'd on the ground,
       Some blood, and several footsteps, but no more:
     Juan the gate gain'd, turn'd the key about,
     And liking not the inside, lock'd the out.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Here ends this canto.--Need I sing, or say,
       How Juan naked, favour'd by the night,
     Who favours what she should not, found his way,
       And reach'd his home in an unseemly plight?
     The pleasant scandal which arose next day,
       The nine days' wonder which was brought to light,
     And how Alfonso sued for a divorce,
     Were in the English newspapers, of course.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If you would like to see the whole proceedings,
       The depositions, and the cause at full,
     The names of all the witnesses, the pleadings
       Of counsel to nonsuit, or to annul,
     There 's more than one edition, and the readings
       Are various, but they none of them are dull;
     The best is that in short-hand ta'en by Gurney,
     Who to Madrid on purpose made a journey.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Donna Inez, to divert the train
       Of one of the most circulating scandals
     That had for centuries been known in Spain,
       At least since the retirement of the Vandals,
     First vow'd (and never had she vow'd in vain)
       To Virgin Mary several pounds of candles;
     And then, by the advice of some old ladies,
     She sent her son to be shipp'd off from Cadiz.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She had resolved that he should travel through
       All European climes, by land or sea,
     To mend his former morals, and get new,
       Especially in France and Italy
     (At least this is the thing most people do).
       Julia was sent into a convent: she
     Grieved, but, perhaps, her feelings may be better
     Shown in the following copy of her Letter:--

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'They tell me 't is decided; you depart:
       'T is wise--'t is well, but not the less a pain;
     I have no further claim on your young heart,
       Mine is the victim, and would be again;
     To love too much has been the only art
       I used;--I write in haste, and if a stain
     Be on this sheet, 't is not what it appears;
     My eyeballs burn and throb, but have no tears.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'I loved, I love you, for this love have lost
       State, station, heaven, mankind's, my own esteem,
     And yet can not regret what it hath cost,
       So dear is still the memory of that dream;
     Yet, if I name my guilt, 't is not to boast,
       None can deem harshlier of me than I deem:
     I trace this scrawl because I cannot rest--
     I 've nothing to reproach, or to request.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Man's love is of man's life a thing apart,
       'T is woman's whole existence; man may range
     The court, camp, church, the vessel, and the mart;
       Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange
     Pride, fame, ambition, to fill up his heart,
       And few there are whom these cannot estrange;
     Men have all these resources, we but one,
     To love again, and be again undone.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'You will proceed in pleasure, and in pride,
       Beloved and loving many; all is o'er
     For me on earth, except some years to hide
       My shame and sorrow deep in my heart's core;
     These I could bear, but cannot cast aside
       The passion which still rages as before--
     And so farewell--forgive me, love me--No,
     That word is idle now--but let it go.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'My breast has been all weakness, is so yet;
       But still I think I can collect my mind;
     My blood still rushes where my spirit 's set,
       As roll the waves before the settled wind;
     My heart is feminine, nor can forget--
       To all, except one image, madly blind;
     So shakes the needle, and so stands the pole,
     As vibrates my fond heart to my fix'd soul.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'I have no more to say, but linger still,
       And dare not set my seal upon this sheet,
     And yet I may as well the task fulfil,
       My misery can scarce be more complete:
     I had not lived till now, could sorrow kill;
       Death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet,
     And I must even survive this last adieu,
     And bear with life, to love and pray for you!'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This note was written upon gilt-edged paper
       With a neat little crow-quill, slight and new:
     Her small white hand could hardly reach the taper,
       It trembled as magnetic needles do,
     And yet she did not let one tear escape her;
       The seal a sun-flower; 'Elle vous suit partout,'
     The motto cut upon a white cornelian;
     The wax was superfine, its hue vermilion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This was Don Juan's earliest scrape; but whether
       I shall proceed with his adventures is
     Dependent on the public altogether;
       We 'll see, however, what they say to this:
     Their favour in an author's cap 's a feather,
       And no great mischief 's done by their caprice;
     And if their approbation we experience,
     Perhaps they 'll have some more about a year hence.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     My poem 's epic, and is meant to be
       Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
     With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
       A list of ships, and captains, and kings reigning,
     New characters; the episodes are three:
       A panoramic view of hell 's in training,
     After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
     So that my name of Epic 's no misnomer.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All these things will be specified in time,
       With strict regard to Aristotle's rules,
     The Vade Mecum of the true sublime,
       Which makes so many poets, and some fools:
     Prose poets like blank-verse, I 'm fond of rhyme,
       Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
     I 've got new mythological machinery,
     And very handsome supernatural scenery.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There 's only one slight difference between
       Me and my epic brethren gone before,
     And here the advantage is my own, I ween
       (Not that I have not several merits more,
     But this will more peculiarly be seen);
       They so embellish, that 't is quite a bore
     Their labyrinth of fables to thread through,
     Whereas this story 's actually true.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If any person doubt it, I appeal
       To history, tradition, and to facts,
     To newspapers, whose truth all know and feel,
       To plays in five, and operas in three acts;
     All these confirm my statement a good deal,
       But that which more completely faith exacts
     Is that myself, and several now in Seville,
     Saw Juan's last elopement with the devil.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If ever I should condescend to prose,
       I 'll write poetical commandments, which
     Shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
       That went before; in these I shall enrich
     My text with many things that no one knows,
       And carry precept to the highest pitch:
     I 'll call the work 'Longinus o'er a Bottle,
     Or, Every Poet his own Aristotle.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thou shalt believe in Milton, Dryden, Pope;
       Thou shalt not set up Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey;
     Because the first is crazed beyond all hope,
       The second drunk, the third so quaint and mouthy:
     With Crabbe it may be difficult to cope,
       And Campbell's Hippocrene is somewhat drouthy:
     Thou shalt not steal from Samuel Rogers, nor
     Commit--flirtation with the muse of Moore.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If any person should presume to assert
       This story is not moral, first, I pray,
     That they will not cry out before they 're hurt,
       Then that they 'll read it o'er again, and say
     (But, doubtless, nobody will be so pert)
       That this is not a moral tale, though gay;
     Besides, in Canto Twelfth, I mean to show
     The very place where wicked people go.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If, after all, there should be some so blind
       To their own good this warning to despise,
     Led by some tortuosity of mind,
       Not to believe my verse and their own eyes,
     And cry that they 'the moral cannot find,'
       I tell him, if a clergyman, he lies;
     Should captains the remark, or critics, make,
     They also lie too--under a mistake.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The public approbation I expect,
       And beg they 'll take my word about the moral,
     Which I with their amusement will connect
       (So children cutting teeth receive a coral);
     Meantime, they 'll doubtless please to recollect
       My epical pretensions to the laurel:
     For fear some prudish readers should grow skittish,
     I 've bribed my grandmother's review--the British.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I sent it in a letter to the Editor,
       Who thank'd me duly by return of post--
     I 'm for a handsome article his creditor;
       Yet, if my gentle Muse he please to roast,
     And break a promise after having made it her,
       Denying the receipt of what it cost,
     And smear his page with gall instead of honey,
     All I can say is--that he had the money.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I think that with this holy new alliance
       I may ensure the public, and defy
     All other magazines of art or science,
       Daily, or monthly, or three monthly; I
     Have not essay'd to multiply their clients,
       Because they tell me 't were in vain to try,
     And that the Edinburgh Review and Quarterly
     Treat a dissenting author very martyrly.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
       Consule Planco,' Horace said, and so
     Say I; by which quotation there is meant a
       Hint that some six or seven good years ago
     (Long ere I dreamt of dating from the Brenta)
       I was most ready to return a blow,
     And would not brook at all this sort of thing
     In my hot youth--when George the Third was King.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But now at thirty years my hair is grey
       (I wonder what it will be like at forty?
     I thought of a peruke the other day)--
       My heart is not much greener; and, in short, I
     Have squander'd my whole summer while 't was May,
       And feel no more the spirit to retort; I
     Have spent my life, both interest and principal,
     And deem not, what I deem'd, my soul invincible.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     No more--no more--Oh! never more on me
       The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
     Which out of all the lovely things we see
       Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
     Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
       Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
     Alas! 't was not in them, but in thy power
     To double even the sweetness of a flower.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     No more--no more--Oh! never more, my heart,
       Canst thou be my sole world, my universe!
     Once all in all, but now a thing apart,
       Thou canst not be my blessing or my curse:
     The illusion 's gone for ever, and thou art
       Insensible, I trust, but none the worse,
     And in thy stead I 've got a deal of judgment,
     Though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     My days of love are over; me no more
       The charms of maid, wife, and still less of widow,
     Can make the fool of which they made before,--
       In short, I must not lead the life I did do;
     The credulous hope of mutual minds is o'er,
       The copious use of claret is forbid too,
     So for a good old-gentlemanly vice,
     I think I must take up with avarice.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Ambition was my idol, which was broken
       Before the shrines of Sorrow, and of Pleasure;
     And the two last have left me many a token
       O'er which reflection may be made at leisure:
     Now, like Friar Bacon's brazen head, I 've spoken,
       'Time is, Time was, Time 's past:'--a chymic treasure
     Is glittering youth, which I have spent betimes--
     My heart in passion, and my head on rhymes.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     What is the end of Fame? 't is but to fill
       A certain portion of uncertain paper:
     Some liken it to climbing up a hill,
       Whose summit, like all hills, is lost in vapour;
     For this men write, speak, preach, and heroes kill,
       And bards burn what they call their 'midnight taper,'
     To have, when the original is dust,
     A name, a wretched picture, and worse bust.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     What are the hopes of man? Old Egypt's King
       Cheops erected the first pyramid
     And largest, thinking it was just the thing
       To keep his memory whole, and mummy hid;
     But somebody or other rummaging,
       Burglariously broke his coffin's lid:
     Let not a monument give you or me hopes,
     Since not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But I being fond of true philosophy,
       Say very often to myself, 'Alas!
     All things that have been born were born to die,
       And flesh (which Death mows down to hay) is grass;
     You 've pass'd your youth not so unpleasantly,
       And if you had it o'er again--'t would pass--
     So thank your stars that matters are no worse,
     And read your Bible, sir, and mind your purse.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But for the present, gentle reader! and
       Still gentler purchaser! the bard--that 's I--
     Must, with permission, shake you by the hand,
       And so 'Your humble servant, and good-b'ye!'
     We meet again, if we should understand
       Each other; and if not, I shall not try
     Your patience further than by this short sample--
     'T were well if others follow'd my example.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Go, little book, from this my solitude!
       I cast thee on the waters--go thy ways!
     And if, as I believe, thy vein be good,
       The world will find thee after many days.'
     When Southey's read, and Wordsworth understood,
       I can't help putting in my claim to praise--
     The four first rhymes are Southey's every line:
     For God's sake, reader! take them not for mine.

TITLE Don Juan, II 

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,
       Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,
     I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,
       It mends their morals, never mind the pain:
     The best of mothers and of educations
       In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,
     Since, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he
     Became divested of his native modesty.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Had he but been placed at a public school,
       In the third form, or even in the fourth,
     His daily task had kept his fancy cool,
       At least, had he been nurtured in the north;
     Spain may prove an exception to the rule,
       But then exceptions always prove its worth--
     A lad of sixteen causing a divorce
     Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I can't say that it puzzles me at all,
       If all things be consider'd: first, there was
     His lady--mother, mathematical,
       A--never mind; his tutor, an old ass;
     A pretty woman (that 's quite natural,
       Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);
     A husband rather old, not much in unity
     With his young wife--a time, and opportunity.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Well--well, the world must turn upon its axis,
       And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,
     And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,
       And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;
     The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,
       The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,
     A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,
     Fighting, devotion, dust,--perhaps a name.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz--
       A pretty town, I recollect it well--
     'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is
       (Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),
     And such sweet girls--I mean, such graceful ladies,
       Their very walk would make your bosom swell;
     I can't describe it, though so much it strike,
     Nor liken it--I never saw the like:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb
       New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,
     No--none of these will do;--and then their garb!
       Their veil and petticoat--Alas! to dwell
     Upon such things would very near absorb
       A canto--then their feet and ankles,--well,
     Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready
     (And so, my sober Muse--come, let 's be steady--

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Chaste Muse!--well, if you must, you must)--the veil
       Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,
     While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,
       Flashes into the heart:--All sunny land
     Of love! when I forget you, may I fail
       To--say my prayers--but never was there plann'd
     A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,
     Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent
       Her son to Cadiz only to embark;
     To stay there had not answer'd her intent,
       But why?--we leave the reader in the dark--
     'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,
       As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,
     To wean him from the wickedness of earth,
     And send him like a dove of promise forth.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Don Juan bade his valet pack his things
       According to direction, then received
     A lecture and some money: for four springs
       He was to travel; and though Inez grieved
     (As every kind of parting has its stings),
       She hoped he would improve--perhaps believed:
     A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)
     Of good advice--and two or three of credit.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In the mean time, to pass her hours away,
       Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school
     For naughty children, who would rather play
       (Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;
     Infants of three years old were taught that day,
       Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:
     The great success of Juan's education,
     Spurr'd her to teach another generation.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan embark'd--the ship got under way,
       The wind was fair, the water passing rough:
     A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,
       As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;
     And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray
       Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:
     And there he stood to take, and take again,
     His first--perhaps his last--farewell of Spain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I can't but say it is an awkward sight
       To see one's native land receding through
     The growing waters; it unmans one quite,
       Especially when life is rather new:
     I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,
       But almost every other country 's blue,
     When gazing on them, mystified by distance,
     We enter on our nautical existence.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:
       The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,
     And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,
       From which away so fair and fast they bore.
     The best of remedies is a beef-steak
       Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before
     You sneer, and I assure you this is true,
     For I have found it answer--so may you.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,
       Beheld his native Spain receding far:
     First partings form a lesson hard to learn,
       Even nations feel this when they go to war;
     There is a sort of unexprest concern,
       A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:
     At leaving even the most unpleasant people
     And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Juan had got many things to leave,
       His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,
     So that he had much better cause to grieve
       Than many persons more advanced in life;
     And if we now and then a sigh must heave
       At quitting even those we quit in strife,
     No doubt we weep for those the heart endears--
     That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews
       By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:
     I 'd weep,--but mine is not a weeping Muse,
       And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;
     Young men should travel, if but to amuse
       Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on
     Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,
     Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,
       While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,
     'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;
       You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,
     The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought
       Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he
     Reflected on his present situation,
     And seriously resolved on reformation.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,
       'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,
     But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,
       Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:
     Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!
       Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,
     Farewell, too, dearest Julia!--(Here he drew
     Her letter out again, and read it through.)

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear--
       But that 's impossible, and cannot be--
     Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,
       Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,
     Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!
       Or think of any thing excepting thee;
     A mind diseased no remedy can physic
     (Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),
       O, Julia! what is every other wo?
     (For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;
       Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)
     Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)--
       O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)--
     Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'
     (Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,
       Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,
     Beyond the best apothecary's art,
       The loss of love, the treachery of friends,
     Or death of those we dote on, when a part
       Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:
     No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,
     But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold
       Out through a fever caused by its own heat,
     But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,
       And find a quincy very hard to treat;
     Against all noble maladies he 's bold,
       But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,
     Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,
     Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But worst of all is nausea, or a pain
       About the lower region of the bowels;
     Love, who heroically breathes a vein,
       Shrinks from the application of hot towels,
     And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,
       Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else
     Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,
     Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'
       Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;
     For there the Spanish family Moncada
       Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:
     They were relations, and for them he had a
       Letter of introduction, which the morn
     Of his departure had been sent him by
     His Spanish friends for those in Italy.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     His suite consisted of three servants and
       A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,
     Who several languages did understand,
       But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,
     And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,
       His headache being increased by every billow;
     And the waves oozing through the port-hole made
     His berth a little damp, and him afraid.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was not without some reason, for the wind
       Increased at night, until it blew a gale;
     And though 't was not much to a naval mind,
       Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,
     For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:
       At sunset they began to take in sail,
     For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,
     And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift
       Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,
     Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,
       Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the
     Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift
       Herself from out her present jeopardy,
     The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound
     The pumps, and there were four feet water found.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     One gang of people instantly was put
       Upon the pumps and the remainder set
     To get up part of the cargo, and what not;
       But they could not come at the leak as yet;
     At last they did get at it really, but
       Still their salvation was an even bet:
     The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,
     While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Into the opening; but all such ingredients
       Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,
     Despite of all their efforts and expedients,
       But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known
     To all the brother tars who may have need hence,
       For fifty tons of water were upthrown
     By them per hour, and they had all been undone,
     But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,
       And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,
     And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet
       Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.
     The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late
       A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,
     A gust--which all descriptive power transcends--
     Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;
       The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,
     And made a scene men do not soon forget;
       For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,
     Or any other thing that brings regret,
       Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:
     Thus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,
     And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Immediately the masts were cut away,
       Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,
     The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay
       Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.
     Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they
       Eased her at last (although we never meant
     To part with all till every hope was blighted),
     And then with violence the old ship righted.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It may be easily supposed, while this
       Was going on, some people were unquiet,
     That passengers would find it much amiss
       To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;
     That even the able seaman, deeming his
       Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,
     As upon such occasions tars will ask
     For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms
       As rum and true religion: thus it was,
     Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,
       The high wind made the treble, and as bas
     The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms
       Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:
     Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,
     Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for
       Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,
     Got to the spirit-room, and stood before
       It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,
     As if Death were more dreadful by his door
       Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,
     Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,
     Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be
       All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!
     'T is true that death awaits both you and me,
       But let us die like men, not sink below
     Like brutes;'--and thus his dangerous post kept he,
       And none liked to anticipate the blow;
     And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,
     Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The good old gentleman was quite aghast,
       And made a loud and pious lamentation;
     Repented all his sins, and made a last
       Irrevocable vow of reformation;
     Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)
       To quit his academic occupation,
     In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,
     To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But now there came a flash of hope once more;
       Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,
     The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,
       The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.
     They tried the pumps again, and though before
       Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,
     A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale--
     The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,
       And for the moment it had some effect;
     But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,
       Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?
     But still 't is best to struggle to the last,
       'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:
     And though 't is true that man can only die once,
     'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,
       Without their will, they carried them away;
     For they were forced with steering to dispense,
       And never had as yet a quiet day
     On which they might repose, or even commence
       A jurymast or rudder, or could say
     The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,
     Still swam--though not exactly like a duck.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,
       But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope
     To weather out much longer; the distress
       Was also great with which they had to cope
     For want of water, and their solid mess
       Was scant enough: in vain the telescope
     Was used--nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,
     Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Again the weather threaten'd,--again blew
       A gale, and in the fore and after hold
     Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew
       All this, the most were patient, and some bold,
     Until the chains and leathers were worn through
       Of all our pumps:--a wreck complete she roll'd,
     At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are
     Like human beings during civil war.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears
       In his rough eyes, and told the captain he
     Could do no more: he was a man in years,
       And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,
     And if he wept at length, they were not fears
       That made his eyelids as a woman's be,
     But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,--
     Two things for dying people quite bewildering.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The ship was evidently settling now
       Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,
     Some went to prayers again, and made a vow
       Of candles to their saints--but there were none
     To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;
       Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one
     That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,
     Who told him to be damn'd--in his confusion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on
       Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;
     Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,
       And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;
     And others went on as they had begun,
       Getting the boats out, being well aware
     That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,
     Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The worst of all was, that in their condition,
       Having been several days in great distress,
     'T was difficult to get out such provision
       As now might render their long suffering less:
     Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;
       Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:
     Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
     Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But in the long-boat they contrived to stow
       Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;
     Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;
       Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get
     A portion of their beef up from below,
       And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,
     But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon--
     Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had
       Been stove in the beginning of the gale;
     And the long-boat's condition was but bad,
       As there were but two blankets for a sail,
     And one oar for a mast, which a young lad
       Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;
     And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,
     To save one half the people then on board.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down
       Over the waste of waters; like a veil,
     Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown
       Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,
     Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,
       And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,
     And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear
     Been their familiar, and now Death was here.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some trial had been making at a raft,
       With little hope in such a rolling sea,
     A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,
       If any laughter at such times could be,
     Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,
       And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,
     Half epileptical and half hysterical:--
     Their preservation would have been a miracle.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,
       And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,
     That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,
       For yet they strove, although of no great use:
     There was no light in heaven but a few stars,
       The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;
     She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,
     And, going down head foremost--sunk, in short.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell--
       Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,
     Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,
       As eager to anticipate their grave;
     And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,
       And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,
     Like one who grapples with his enemy,
     And strives to strangle him before he die.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And first one universal shriek there rush'd,
       Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash
     Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,
       Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
     Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,
       Accompanied with a convulsive splash,
     A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry
     Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The boats, as stated, had got off before,
       And in them crowded several of the crew;
     And yet their present hope was hardly more
       Than what it had been, for so strong it blew
     There was slight chance of reaching any shore;
       And then they were too many, though so few--
     Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,
     Were counted in them when they got afloat.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls
       Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!
     When over Catholics the ocean rolls,
       They must wait several weeks before a mass
     Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,
       Because, till people know what 's come to pass,
     They won't lay out their money on the dead--
     It costs three francs for every mass that 's said.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan got into the long-boat, and there
       Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;
     It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,
       For Juan wore the magisterial face
     Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair
       Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:
     Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),
     Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,
       But the same cause, conducive to his loss,
     Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave
       As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,
     And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;
       They could not rescue him although so close,
     Because the sea ran higher every minute,
     And for the boat--the crew kept crowding in it.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A small old spaniel,--which had been Don Jose's,
       His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,
     For on such things the memory reposes
       With tenderness--stood howling on the brink,
     Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),
       No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;
     And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd
     Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He also stuff'd his money where he could
       About his person, and Pedrillo's too,
     Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,
       Not knowing what himself to say, or do,
     As every rising wave his dread renew'd;
       But Juan, trusting they might still get through,
     And deeming there were remedies for any ill,
     Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,
       That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,
     Though on the wave's high top too much to set,
       They dared not take it in for all the breeze:
     Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,
       And made them bale without a moment's ease,
     So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,
     And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still
       Kept above water, with an oar for mast,
     Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill
       Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:
     Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,
       And present peril all before surpass'd,
     They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,
     And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign
       Of the continuance of the gale: to run
     Before the sea until it should grow fine,
       Was all that for the present could be done:
     A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine
       Were served out to the people, who begun
     To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,
     And most of them had little clothes but rags.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They counted thirty, crowded in a space
       Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;
     They did their best to modify their case,
       One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,
     While t'other half were laid down in their place
       At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian
     Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,
     With nothing but the sky for a great coat.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is very certain the desire of life
       Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,
     When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,
       Survive through very desperate conditions,
     Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife
       Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:
     Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,
     And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is said that persons living on annuities
       Are longer lived than others,--God knows why,
     Unless to plague the grantors,--yet so true it is,
       That some, I really think, do never die;
     Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,
       And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:
     In my young days they lent me cash that way,
     Which I found very troublesome to pay.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is thus with people in an open boat,
       They live upon the love of life, and bear
     More than can be believed, or even thought,
       And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;
     And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,
       Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;
     She had a curious crew as well as cargo,
     Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But man is a carnivorous production,
       And must have meals, at least one meal a day;
     He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,
       But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;
     Although his anatomical construction
       Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,
     Your labouring people think beyond all question,
     Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And thus it was with this our hapless crew;
       For on the third day there came on a calm,
     And though at first their strength it might renew,
       And lying on their weariness like balm,
     Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue
       Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,
     And fell all ravenously on their provision,
     Instead of hoarding it with due precision.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The consequence was easily foreseen--
       They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,
     In spite of all remonstrances, and then
       On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?
     They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!
       And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,
     But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,
     It would have been more wise to save their victual.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,
       And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:
     The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,
       The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild--
     With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)
       What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:
     So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,
     Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,
       And Juan, who had still refused, because
     The creature was his father's dog that died,
       Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,
     With some remorse received (though first denied)
       As a great favour one of the fore-paws,
     Which he divided with Pedrillo, who
     Devour'd it, longing for the other too.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The seventh day, and no wind--the burning sun
       Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,
     They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,
       Save in the breeze that came not; savagely
     They glared upon each other--all was done,
       Water, and wine, and food,--and you might see
     The longings of the cannibal arise
     (Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     At length one whisper'd his companion, who
       Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,
     And then into a hoarser murmur grew,
       An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;
     And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,
       'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:
     And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,
     And who should die to be his fellow's food.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But ere they came to this, they that day shared
       Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;
     And then they look'd around them and despair'd,
       And none to be the sacrifice would choose;
     At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,
       But of materials that much shock the Muse--
     Having no paper, for the want of better,
     They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,
       In silent horror, and their distribution
     Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,
       Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;
     None in particular had sought or plann'd it,
       'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,
     By which none were permitted to be neuter--
     And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He but requested to be bled to death:
       The surgeon had his instruments, and bled
     Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,
       You hardly could perceive when he was dead.
     He died as born, a Catholic in faith,
       Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,
     And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,
     And then held out his jugular and wrist.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The surgeon, as there was no other fee,
       Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;
     But being thirstiest at the moment, he
       Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:
     Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,
       And such things as the entrails and the brains
     Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow--
     The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The sailors ate him, all save three or four,
       Who were not quite so fond of animal food;
     To these was added Juan, who, before
       Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could
     Feel now his appetite increased much more;
       'T was not to be expected that he should,
     Even in extremity of their disaster,
     Dine with them on his pastor and his master.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,
       The consequence was awful in the extreme;
     For they, who were most ravenous in the act,
       Went raging mad--Lord! how they did blaspheme!
     And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,
       Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,
     Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,
     And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,
       And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;
     And some of them had lost their recollection,
       Happier than they who still perceived their woes;
     But others ponder'd on a new dissection,
       As if not warn'd sufficiently by those
     Who had already perish'd, suffering madly,
     For having used their appetites so sadly.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And next they thought upon the master's mate,
       As fattest; but he saved himself, because,
     Besides being much averse from such a fate,
       There were some other reasons: the first was,
     He had been rather indisposed of late;
       And that which chiefly proved his saving clause
     Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,
     By general subscription of the ladies.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,
       But was used sparingly,--some were afraid,
     And others still their appetites constrain'd,
       Or but at times a little supper made;
     All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,
       Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:
     At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,
     And then they left off eating the dead body.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,
       Remember Ugolino condescends
     To eat the head of his arch-enemy
       The moment after he politely ends
     His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea
       'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,
     When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,
     Without being much more horrible than Dante.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And the same night there fell a shower of rain,
       For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth
     When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain
       Men really know not what good water 's worth;
     If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,
       Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,
     Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,
     You 'd wish yourself where Truth is--in a well.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer
       Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,
     Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,
       And when they deem'd its moisture was complete
     They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher
       Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
     As a full pot of porter, to their thinking
     They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,
       Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;
     Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,
       As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd
     To beg the beggar, who could not rain back
       A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd
     To taste of heaven--If this be true, indeed
     Some Christians have a comfortable creed.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,
       And with them their two sons, of whom the one
     Was more robust and hardy to the view,
       But he died early; and when he was gone,
     His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw
       One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!
     I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown
     Into the deep without a tear or groan.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The other father had a weaklier child,
       Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;
     But the boy bore up long, and with a mild
       And patient spirit held aloof his fate;
     Little he said, and now and then he smiled,
       As if to win a part from off the weight
     He saw increasing on his father's heart,
     With the deep deadly thought that they must part.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised
       His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam
     From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,
       And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,
     And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,
       Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,
     He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
     Into his dying child's mouth--but in vain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The boy expired--the father held the clay,
       And look'd upon it long, and when at last
     Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay
       Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,
     He watch'd it wistfully, until away
       'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;
     Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,
     And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through
       The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,
     Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;
       And all within its arch appear'd to be
     Clearer than that without, and its wide hue
       Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,
     Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then
     Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,
       The airy child of vapour and the sun,
     Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,
       Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,
     Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,
       And blending every colour into one,
     Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
     (For sometimes we must box without the muffle).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen--
       It is as well to think so, now and then;
     'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,
       And may become of great advantage when
     Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men
       Had greater need to nerve themselves again
     Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope--
     Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     About this time a beautiful white bird,
       Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size
     And plumage (probably it might have err'd
       Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,
     And tried to perch, although it saw and heard
       The men within the boat, and in this guise
     It came and went, and flutter'd round them till
     Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But in this case I also must remark,
       'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,
     Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark
       Was not so safe for roosting as a church;
     And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,
       Returning there from her successful search,
     Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,
     They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     With twilight it again came on to blow,
       But not with violence; the stars shone out,
     The boat made way; yet now they were so low,
       They knew not where nor what they were about;
     Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'
       The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt--
     Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,
     And all mistook about the latter once.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     As morning broke, the light wind died away,
       When he who had the watch sung out and swore,
     If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,
       He wish'd that land he never might see more;
     And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,
       Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;
     For shore it was, and gradually grew
     Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then of these some part burst into tears,
       And others, looking with a stupid stare,
     Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,
       And seem'd as if they had no further care;
     While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)--
       And at the bottom of the boat three were
     Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,
     And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The day before, fast sleeping on the water,
       They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,
     And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,
       Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind
     Proved even still a more nutritious matter,
       Because it left encouragement behind:
     They thought that in such perils, more than chance
     Had sent them this for their deliverance.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,
       And higher grew the mountains as they drew,
     Set by a current, toward it: they were lost
       In various conjectures, for none knew
     To what part of the earth they had been tost,
       So changeable had been the winds that blew;
     Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,
     Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Meantime the current, with a rising gale,
       Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,
     Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:
       Their living freight was now reduced to four,
     And three dead, whom their strength could not avail
       To heave into the deep with those before,
     Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd
     The spray into their faces as they splash'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done
       Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to
     Such things a mother had not known her son
       Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;
     By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one
       They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,
     But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,
     In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen
       Unequal in its aspect here and there,
     They felt the freshness of its growing green,
       That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,
     And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
       From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare--
     Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep
     Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,
       And girt by formidable waves; but they
     Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,
       Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:
     A reef between them also now began
       To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,
     But finding no place for their landing better,
     They ran the boat for shore,--and overset her.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,
       Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;
     And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,
       Had often turn'd the art to some account:
     A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,
       He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,
     As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)
     Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,
       He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply
     With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,
       The beach which lay before him, high and dry:
     The greatest danger here was from a shark,
       That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;
     As for the other two, they could not swim,
     So nobody arrived on shore but him.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,
       Which, providentially for him, was wash'd
     Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,
       And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd
     Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore
       The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;
     At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he
     Roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung
       Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,
     From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,
       Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:
     And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,
       Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,
     With just enough of life to feel its pain,
     And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     With slow and staggering effort he arose,
       But sunk again upon his bleeding knee
     And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those
       Who long had been his mates upon the sea;
     But none of them appear'd to share his woes,
       Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,
     Who died two days before, and now had found
     An unknown barren beach for burial ground.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,
       And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand
     Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:
       He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand
     Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),
       And, like a wither'd lily, on the land
     His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,
     As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     How long in his damp trance young Juan lay
       He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,
     And Time had nothing more of night nor day
       For his congealing blood, and senses dim;
     And how this heavy faintness pass'd away
       He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,
     And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,
     For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,
       For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought
     He still was in the boat and had but dozed,
       And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,
     And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;
       And then once more his feelings back were brought,
     And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
     A lovely female face of seventeen.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth
       Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;
     And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth
       Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;
     And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe
       Each pulse to animation, till beneath
     Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh
     To these kind efforts made a low reply.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung
       Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm
     Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;
       And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,
     Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung
       His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;
     And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew
     A sigh from his heaved bosom--and hers, too.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And lifting him with care into the cave,
       The gentle girl and her attendant,--one
     Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,
       And more robust of figure,--then begun
     To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave
       Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun
     Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er
     She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,
       That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair--
     Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd
       In braids behind; and though her stature were
     Even of the highest for a female mould,
       They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air
     There was a something which bespoke command,
     As one who was a lady in the land.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes
       Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,
     Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies
       Deepest attraction; for when to the view
     Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,
       Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;
     'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,
     And hurls at once his venom and his strength.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye
       Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;
     Short upper lip--sweet lips! that make us sigh
       Ever to have seen such; for she was one
     Fit for the model of a statuary
       (A race of mere impostors, when all 's done--
     I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,
     Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just
       One should not rail without a decent cause:
     There was an Irish lady, to whose bust
       I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was
     A frequent model; and if e'er she must
       Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,
     They will destroy a face which mortal thought
     Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And such was she, the lady of the cave:
       Her dress was very different from the Spanish,
     Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;
       For, as you know, the Spanish women banish
     Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave
       Around them (what I hope will never vanish)
     The basquina and the mantilla, they
     Seem at the same time mystical and gay.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But with our damsel this was not the case:
       Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;
     Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,
       But through them gold and gems profusely shone:
     Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace
       Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone
     Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,
     Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The other female's dress was not unlike,
       But of inferior materials: she
     Had not so many ornaments to strike,
       Her hair had silver only, bound to be
     Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,
       Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;
     Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes
     As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both
       With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,
     Which are (as I must own) of female growth,
       And have ten thousand delicate inventions:
     They made a most superior mess of broth,
       A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,
     But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's
     Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,
       Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;
     Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air
       Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;
     And so, in short, the girls they really were
       They shall appear before your curious eyes,
     Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter
     Of an old man who lived upon the water.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A fisherman he had been in his youth,
       And still a sort of fisherman was he;
     But other speculations were, in sooth,
       Added to his connection with the sea,
     Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:
       A little smuggling, and some piracy,
     Left him, at last, the sole of many masters
     Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A fisher, therefore, was he,--though of men,
       Like Peter the Apostle,--and he fish'd
     For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,
       And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;
     The cargoes he confiscated, and gain
       He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd
     Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,
     By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He was a Greek, and on his isle had built
       (One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)
     A very handsome house from out his guilt,
       And there he lived exceedingly at ease;
     Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,
       A sad old fellow was he, if you please;
     But this I know, it was a spacious building,
     Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,
       The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;
     Besides, so very beautiful was she,
       Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:
     Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree
       She grew to womanhood, and between whiles
     Rejected several suitors, just to learn
     How to accept a better in his turn.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And walking out upon the beach, below
       The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,
     Insensible,--not dead, but nearly so,--
       Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;
     But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,
       Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,
     As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,
     A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But taking him into her father's house
       Was not exactly the best way to save,
     But like conveying to the cat the mouse,
       Or people in a trance into their grave;
     Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'
       Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,
     He would have hospitably cured the stranger,
     And sold him instantly when out of danger.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best
       (A virgin always on her maid relies)
     To place him in the cave for present rest:
       And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,
     Their charity increased about their guest;
       And their compassion grew to such a size,
     It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven
     (St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They made a fire,--but such a fire as they
       Upon the moment could contrive with such
     Materials as were cast up round the bay,--
       Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch
     Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay
       A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;
     But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,
     That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,
       For Haidee stripped her sables off to make
     His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,
       And warm, in case by chance he should awake,
     They also gave a petticoat apiece,
       She and her maid--and promised by daybreak
     To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish
     For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And thus they left him to his lone repose:
       Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,
     Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),
       Just for the present; and in his lull'd head
     Not even a vision of his former woes
       Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread
     Unwelcome visions of our former years,
     Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Young Juan slept all dreamless:--but the maid,
       Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den
     Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,
       And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.
     He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said
       (The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),
     He had pronounced her name--but she forgot
     That at this moment Juan knew it not.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And pensive to her father's house she went,
       Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who
     Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,
       She being wiser by a year or two:
     A year or two 's an age when rightly spent,
       And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,
     In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
     Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still
       Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon
     His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,
       And the young beams of the excluded sun,
     Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;
       And need he had of slumber yet, for none
     Had suffer'd more--his hardships were comparative
     To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,
       And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er
     Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,
       And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;
     And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,
       And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore
     In several oaths--Armenian, Turk, and Greek--
     They knew not what to think of such a freak.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But up she got, and up she made them get,
       With some pretence about the sun, that makes
     Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;
       And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks
     Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet
       With mist, and every bird with him awakes,
     And night is flung off like a mourning suit
     Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,
       I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late
     I have sat up on purpose all the night,
       Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;
     And so all ye, who would be in the right
       In health and purse, begin your day to date
     From daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,
     Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Haidee met the morning face to face;
       Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush
     Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race
       From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,
     Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,
       That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,
     Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;
     Or the Red Sea--but the sea is not red.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And down the cliff the island virgin came,
       And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,
     While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,
       And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,
     Taking her for a sister; just the same
       Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,
     Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,
     Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd
       All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw
     That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;
       And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe
     (For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept
       And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,
     Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death
     Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And thus like to an angel o'er the dying
       Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there
     All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,
       As o'er him the calm and stirless air:
     But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,
       Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair
     Must breakfast--and betimes, lest they should ask it,
     She drew out her provision from the basket.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She knew that the best feelings must have victual,
       And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;
     Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,
       And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;
     And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;
       I can't say that she gave them any tea,
     But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,
     With Scio wine,--and all for love, not money.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and
       The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;
     But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,
       And without word, a sign her finger drew on
     Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;
       And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,
     Because her mistress would not let her break
     That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek
       A purple hectic play'd like dying day
     On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak
       Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,
     Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;
       And his black curls were dewy with the spray,
     Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,
     Mix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,
       Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,
     Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,
       Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,
     Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,
       Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;
     In short, he was a very pretty fellow,
     Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,
       But the fair face which met his eyes forbade
     Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain
       Had further sleep a further pleasure made;
     For woman's face was never form'd in vain
       For Juan, so that even when he pray'd
     He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,
     To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And thus upon his elbow he arose,
       And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek
     The pale contended with the purple rose,
       As with an effort she began to speak;
     Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,
       Although she told him, in good modern Greek,
     With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,
     That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now Juan could not understand a word,
       Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,
     And her voice was the warble of a bird,
       So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,
     That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;
       The sort of sound we echo with a tear,
     Without knowing why--an overpowering tone,
     Whence Melody descends as from a throne.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Juan gazed as one who is awoke
       By a distant organ, doubting if he be
     Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke
       By the watchman, or some such reality,
     Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;
       At least it is a heavy sound to me,
     Who like a morning slumber--for the night
     Shows stars and women in a better light.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,
       Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling
     A most prodigious appetite: the steam
       Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing
     Upon his senses, and the kindling beam
       Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling
     To stir her viands, made him quite awake
     And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But beef is rare within these oxless isles;
       Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;
     And, when a holiday upon them smiles,
       A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:
     But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,
       For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;
     Others are fair and fertile, among which
     This, though not large, was one of the most rich.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking
       That the old fable of the Minotaur--
     From which our modern morals rightly shrinking
       Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore
     A cow's shape for a mask--was only (sinking
       The allegory) a mere type, no more,
     That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,
     To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For we all know that English people are
       Fed upon beef--I won't say much of beer,
     Because 't is liquor only, and being far
       From this my subject, has no business here;
     We know, too, they very fond of war,
       A pleasure--like all pleasures--rather dear;
     So were the Cretans--from which I infer
     That beef and battles both were owing to her.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But to resume. The languid Juan raised
       His head upon his elbow, and he saw
     A sight on which he had not lately gazed,
       As all his latter meals had been quite raw,
     Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,
       And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,
     He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like
     A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,
       Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed
     Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see
       Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;
     But Zoe, being older than Haidee,
       Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)
     That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,
     And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And so she took the liberty to state,
       Rather by deeds than words, because the case
     Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate
       Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
     The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,
       Unless he wish'd to die upon the place--
     She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,
     Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Next they--he being naked, save a tatter'd
       Pair of scarce decent trowsers--went to work,
     And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,
       And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,
     Or Greek--that is, although it not much matter'd,
       Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,--
     They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,
     With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,
       But not a word could Juan comprehend,
     Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in
       Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;
     And, as he interrupted not, went eking
       Her speech out to her protege and friend,
     Till pausing at the last her breath to take,
     She saw he did not understand Romaic.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,
       And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,
     And read (the only book she could) the lines
       Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,
     The answer eloquent, where soul shines
       And darts in one quick glance a long reply;
     And thus in every look she saw exprest
     A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,
       And words repeated after her, he took
     A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,
       No doubt, less of her language than her look:
     As he who studies fervently the skies
       Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,
     Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better
     From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue
       By female lips and eyes--that is, I mean,
     When both the teacher and the taught are young,
       As was the case, at least, where I have been;
     They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong
       They smile still more, and then there intervene
     Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;--
     I learn'd the little that I know by this:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,
       Italian not at all, having no teachers;
     Much English I cannot pretend to speak,
       Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,
     Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week
       I study, also Blair, the highest reachers
     Of eloquence in piety and prose--
     I hate your poets, so read none of those.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     As for the ladies, I have nought to say,
       A wanderer from the British world of fashion,
     Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'
       Like other men, too, may have had my passion--
     But that, like other things, has pass'd away,
       And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:
     Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me
     But dreams of what has been, no more to be.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Return we to Don Juan. He begun
       To hear new words, and to repeat them; but
     Some feelings, universal as the sun,
       Were such as could not in his breast be shut
     More than within the bosom of a nun:
       He was in love,--as you would be, no doubt,
     With a young benefactress,--so was she,
     Just in the way we very often see.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And every day by daybreak--rather early
       For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest--
     She came into the cave, but it was merely
       To see her bird reposing in his nest;
     And she would softly stir his locks so curly,
       Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,
     Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,
     As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And every morn his colour freshlier came,
       And every day help'd on his convalescence;
     'T was well, because health in the human frame
       Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,
     For health and idleness to passion's flame
       Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons
     Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,
     Without whom Venus will not long attack us.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     While Venus fills the heart (without heart really
       Love, though good always, is not quite so good),
     Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,--
       For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,--
     While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:
       Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;
     But who is their purveyor from above
     Heaven knows,--it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     When Juan woke he found some good things ready,
       A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes
     That ever made a youthful heart less steady,
       Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;
     But I have spoken of all this already--
       And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,--
     Well--Juan, after bathing in the sea,
     Came always back to coffee and Haidee.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Both were so young, and one so innocent,
       That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd
     To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,
       Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,
     A something to be loved, a creature meant
       To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd
     To render happy; all who joy would win
     Must share it,--Happiness was born a twin.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It was such pleasure to behold him, such
       Enlargement of existence to partake
     Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,
       To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:
     To live with him forever were too much;
       But then the thought of parting made her quake;
     He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast
     Like a rich wreck--her first love, and her last.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee
       Paid daily visits to her boy, and took
     Such plentiful precautions, that still he
       Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;
     At last her father's prows put out to sea
       For certain merchantmen upon the look,
     Not as of yore to carry off an Io,
     But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,
       So that, her father being at sea, she was
     Free as a married woman, or such other
       Female, as where she likes may freely pass,
     Without even the incumbrance of a brother,
       The freest she that ever gazed on glass;
     I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,
     Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now she prolong'd her visits and her talk
       (For they must talk), and he had learnt to say
     So much as to propose to take a walk,--
       For little had he wander'd since the day
     On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,
       Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,--
     And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,
     And saw the sun set opposite the moon.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,
       With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,
     Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,
       With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore
     A better welcome to the tempest-tost;
       And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,
     Save on the dead long summer days, which make
     The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And the small ripple spilt upon the beach
       Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,
     When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,
       That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!
     Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach
       Who please,--the more because they preach in vain,--
     Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,
     Sermons and soda-water the day after.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;
       The best of life is but intoxication:
     Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk
       The hopes of all men, and of every nation;
     Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk
       Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:
     But to return,--Get very drunk; and when
     You wake with headache, you shall see what then.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Ring for your valet--bid him quickly bring
       Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know
     A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;
       For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,
     Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,
       Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,
     After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,
     Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The coast--I think it was the coast that
       Was just describing--Yes, it was the coast--
     Lay at this period quiet as the sky,
       The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,
     And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,
       And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost
     By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret
     Against the boundary it scarcely wet.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,
       As I have said, upon an expedition;
     And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,
       Save Zoe, who, although with due precision
     She waited on her lady with the sun,
       Thought daily service was her only mission,
     Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,
     And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
       Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
     Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
       Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,
     With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
       On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill
     Upon the other, and the rosy sky,
     With one star sparkling through it like an eye.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
       Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
     Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,
       And in the worn and wild receptacles
     Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,
       In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,
     They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,
     Yielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
       Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
     They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
       Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
     They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,
       And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
     Into each other--and, beholding this,
     Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,
       And beauty, all concentrating like rays
     Into one focus, kindled from above;
       Such kisses as belong to early days,
     Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,
       And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,
     Each kiss a heart-quake,--for a kiss's strength,
     I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     By length I mean duration; theirs endured
       Heaven knows how long--no doubt they never reckon'd;
     And if they had, they could not have secured
       The sum of their sensations to a second:
     They had not spoken; but they felt allured,
       As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,
     Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung--
     Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They were alone, but not alone as they
       Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;
     The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,
       The twilight glow which momently grew less,
     The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay
       Around them, made them to each other press,
     As if there were no life beneath the sky
     Save theirs, and that their life could never die.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,
       They felt no terrors from the night, they were
     All in all to each other: though their speech
       Was broken words, they thought a language there,--
     And all the burning tongues the passions teach
       Found in one sigh the best interpreter
     Of nature's oracle--first love,--that all
     Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,
       Nor offer'd any; she had never heard
     Of plight and promises to be a spouse,
       Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;
     She was all which pure ignorance allows,
       And flew to her young mate like a young bird;
     And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she
     Had not one word to say of constancy.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She loved, and was beloved--she adored,
       And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,
     Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,
       If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,--
     But by degrees their senses were restored,
       Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;
     And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart
     Felt as if never more to beat apart.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,
       So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour
     Was that in which the heart is always full,
       And, having o'er itself no further power,
     Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,
       But pays off moments in an endless shower
     Of hell-fire--all prepared for people giving
     Pleasure or pain to one another living.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were
       So loving and so lovely--till then never,
     Excepting our first parents, such a pair
       Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;
     And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,
       Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,
     And hell and purgatory--but forgot
     Just in the very crisis she should not.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They look upon each other, and their eyes
       Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps
     Round Juan's head, and his around her lies
       Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;
     She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,
       He hers, until they end in broken gasps;
     And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,
     Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,
       And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,
     She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,
       Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;
     And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,
       And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,
     Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants
     With all it granted, and with all it grants.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     An infant when it gazes on a light,
       A child the moment when it drains the breast,
     A devotee when soars the Host in sight,
       An Arab with a stranger for a guest,
     A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,
       A miser filling his most hoarded chest,
     Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping
     As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,
       All that it hath of life with us is living;
     So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,
       And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;
     All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,
       Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:
     There lies the thing we love with all its errors
     And all its charms, like death without its terrors.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The lady watch'd her lover--and that hour
       Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,
     O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;
       Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
     She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,
       Where nought upon their passion could intrude,
     And all the stars that crowded the blue space
     Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Alas! the love of women! it is known
       To be a lovely and a fearful thing;
     For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,
       And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring
     To them but mockeries of the past alone,
       And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,
     Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real
     Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,
       Is always so to women; one sole bond
     Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;
       Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond
     Over their idol, till some wealthier lust
       Buys them in marriage--and what rests beyond?
     A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,
     Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,
       Some mind their household, others dissipation,
     Some run away, and but exchange their cares,
       Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;
     Few changes e'er can better their affairs,
       Theirs being an unnatural situation,
     From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:
     Some play the devil, and then write a novel.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;
       Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun
     Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss
       Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one
     Made but to love, to feel that she was his
       Who was her chosen: what was said or done
     Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,
     Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!
       How much it costs us! yet each rising throb
     Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,
       That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob
     Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat
       Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job
     To make us understand each good old maxim,
     So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And now 't was done--on the lone shore were plighted
       Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed
     Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:
       Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,
     By their own feelings hallow'd and united,
       Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:
     And they were happy, for to their young eyes
     Each was an angel, and earth paradise.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,
       Titus the master, Antony the slave,
     Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,
       Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave
     All those may leap who rather would be neuter
       (Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)--
     O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,
     For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,
       And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:
     Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,
       Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;
     Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,
       Such worthies Time will never see again;
     Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,
     They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus
       And Aristippus, a material crew!
     Who to immoral courses would allure us
       By theories quite practicable too;
     If only from the devil they would insure us,
       How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),
     'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'
     So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?
       And should he have forgotten her so soon?
     I can't but say it seems to me most truly
       Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon
     Does these things for us, and whenever newly
       Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,
     Else how the devil is it that fresh features
     Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I hate inconstancy--I loathe, detest,
       Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made
     Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
       No permanent foundation can be laid;
     Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,
       And yet last night, being at a masquerade,
     I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,
     Which gave me some sensations like a villain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But soon Philosophy came to my aid,
       And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'
     'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,
       'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!
     I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,
       Or neither--out of curiosity.'
     'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian
     (Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Stop!' so I stopp'd.--But to return: that which
       Men call inconstancy is nothing more
     Than admiration due where nature's rich
       Profusion with young beauty covers o'er
     Some favour'd object; and as in the niche
       A lovely statue we almost adore,
     This sort of adoration of the real
     Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is the perception of the beautiful,
       A fine extension of the faculties,
     Platonic, universal, wonderful,
       Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,
     Without which life would be extremely dull;
       In short, it is the use of our own eyes,
     With one or two small senses added, just
     To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,
       For surely if we always could perceive
     In the same object graces quite as killing
       As when she rose upon us like an Eve,
     'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling
       (For we must get them any how or grieve),
     Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,
     How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,
       But changes night and day, too, like the sky;
     Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,
       And darkness and destruction as on high:
     But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,
       Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye
     Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,
     Which make the English climate of our years.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The liver is the lazaret of bile,
       But very rarely executes its function,
     For the first passion stays there such a while,
       That all the rest creep in and form a junction,
     Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,--
       Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,--
     So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,
     Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In the mean time, without proceeding more
       In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now
     Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,
       That being about the number I 'll allow
     Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;
       And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,
     Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead
     For them and theirs with all who deign to read.

TITLE Don Juan, III 

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Hail, Muse! et cetera.--We left Juan sleeping,
       Pillow'd upon a fair and happy breast,
     And watch'd by eyes that never yet knew weeping,
       And loved by a young heart, too deeply blest
     To feel the poison through her spirit creeping,
       Or know who rested there, a foe to rest,
     Had soil'd the current of her sinless years,
     And turn'd her pure heart's purest blood to tears!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O, Love! what is it in this world of ours
       Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why
     With cypress branches hast thou Wreathed thy bowers,
       And made thy best interpreter a sigh?
     As those who dote on odours pluck the flowers,
       And place them on their breast--but place to die--
     Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
     Are laid within our bosoms but to perish.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In her first passion woman loves her lover,
       In all the others all she loves is love,
     Which grows a habit she can ne'er get over,
       And fits her loosely--like an easy glove,
     As you may find, whene'er you like to prove her:
       One man alone at first her heart can move;
     She then prefers him in the plural number,
     Not finding that the additions much encumber.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I know not if the fault be men's or theirs;
       But one thing 's pretty sure; a woman planted
     (Unless at once she plunge for life in prayers)
       After a decent time must be gallanted;
     Although, no doubt, her first of love affairs
       Is that to which her heart is wholly granted;
     Yet there are some, they say, who have had none,
     But those who have ne'er end with only one.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is melancholy, and a fearful sign
       Of human frailty, folly, also crime,
     That love and marriage rarely can combine,
       Although they both are born in the same clime;
     Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine--
       A sad, sour, sober beverage--by time
     Is sharpen'd from its high celestial flavour
     Down to a very homely household savour.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There 's something of antipathy, as 't were,
       Between their present and their future state;
     A kind of flattery that 's hardly fair
       Is used until the truth arrives too late--
     Yet what can people do, except despair?
       The same things change their names at such a rate;
     For instance--passion in a lover 's glorious,
     But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;
       They sometimes also get a little tired
     (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond:
       The same things cannot always be admired,
     Yet 't is 'so nominated in the bond,'
       That both are tied till one shall have expired.
     Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning
     Our days, and put one's servants into mourning.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There 's doubtless something in domestic doings
       Which forms, in fact, true love's antithesis;
     Romances paint at full length people's wooings,
       But only give a bust of marriages;
     For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,
       There 's nothing wrong in a connubial kiss:
     Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch's wife,
     He would have written sonnets all his life?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All tragedies are finish'd by a death,
       All comedies are ended by a marriage;
     The future states of both are left to faith,
       For authors fear description might disparage
     The worlds to come of both, or fall beneath,
       And then both worlds would punish their miscarriage;
     So leaving each their priest and prayer-book ready,
     They say no more of Death or of the Lady.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The only two that in my recollection
       Have sung of heaven and hell, or marriage, are
     Dante and Milton, and of both the affection
       Was hapless in their nuptials, for some bar
     Of fault or temper ruin'd the connection
       (Such things, in fact, it don't ask much to mar):
     But Dante's Beatrice and Milton's Eve
     Were not drawn from their spouses, you conceive.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some persons say that Dante meant theology
       By Beatrice, and not a mistress--I,
     Although my opinion may require apology,
       Deem this a commentator's fantasy,
     Unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
       Decided thus, and show'd good reason why;
     I think that Dante's more abstruse ecstatics
     Meant to personify the mathematics.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Haidee and Juan were not married, but
       The fault was theirs, not mine; it is not fair,
     Chaste reader, then, in any way to put
       The blame on me, unless you wish they were;
     Then if you 'd have them wedded, please to shut
       The book which treats of this erroneous pair,
     Before the consequences grow too awful;
     'T is dangerous to read of loves unlawful.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet they were happy,--happy in the illicit
       Indulgence of their innocent desires;
     But more imprudent grown with every visit,
       Haidee forgot the island was her sire's;
     When we have what we like, 't is hard to miss it,
       At least in the beginning, ere one tires;
     Thus she came often, not a moment losing,
     Whilst her piratical papa was cruising.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Let not his mode of raising cash seem strange,
       Although he fleeced the flags of every nation,
     For into a prime minister but change
       His title, and 't is nothing but taxation;
     But he, more modest, took an humbler range
       Of life, and in an honester vocation
     Pursued o'er the high seas his watery journey,
     And merely practised as a sea-attorney.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The good old gentleman had been detain'd
       By winds and waves, and some important captures;
     And, in the hope of more, at sea remain'd,
       Although a squall or two had damp'd his raptures,
     By swamping one of the prizes; he had chain'd
       His prisoners, dividing them like chapters
     In number'd lots; they all had cuffs and collars,
     And averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some he disposed of off Cape Matapan,
       Among his friends the Mainots; some he sold
     To his Tunis correspondents, save one man
       Toss'd overboard unsaleable (being old);
     The rest--save here and there some richer one,
       Reserved for future ransom--in the hold
     Were link'd alike, as for the common people he
     Had a large order from the Dey of Tripoli.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The merchandise was served in the same way,
       Pieced out for different marts in the Levant;
     Except some certain portions of the prey,
       Light classic articles of female want,
     French stuffs, lace, tweezers, toothpicks, teapot, tray,
       Guitars and castanets from Alicant,
     All which selected from the spoil he gathers,
     Robb'd for his daughter by the best of fathers.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A monkey, a Dutch mastiff, a mackaw,
       Two parrots, with a Persian cat and kittens,
     He chose from several animals he saw--
       A terrier, too, which once had been a Briton's,
     Who dying on the coast of Ithaca,
       The peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance;
     These to secure in this strong blowing weather,
     He caged in one huge hamper altogether.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then having settled his marine affairs,
       Despatching single cruisers here and there,
     His vessel having need of some repairs,
       He shaped his course to where his daughter fair
     Continued still her hospitable cares;
       But that part of the coast being shoal and bare,
     And rough with reefs which ran out many a mile,
     His port lay on the other side o' the isle.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And there he went ashore without delay,
       Having no custom-house nor quarantine
     To ask him awkward questions on the way
       About the time and place where he had been:
     He left his ship to be hove down next day,
       With orders to the people to careen;
     So that all hands were busy beyond measure,
     In getting out goods, ballast, guns, and treasure.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Arriving at the summit of a hill
       Which overlook'd the white walls of his home,
     He stopp'd.--What singular emotions fill
       Their bosoms who have been induced to roam!
     With fluttering doubts if all be well or ill--
       With love for many, and with fears for some;
     All feelings which o'erleap the years long lost,
     And bring our hearts back to their starting-post.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The approach of home to husbands and to sires,
       After long travelling by land or water,
     Most naturally some small doubt inspires--
       A female family 's a serious matter
     (None trusts the sex more, or so much admires--
       But they hate flattery, so I never flatter);
     Wives in their husbands' absences grow subtler,
     And daughters sometimes run off with the butler.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     An honest gentleman at his return
       May not have the good fortune of Ulysses;
     Not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn,
       Or show the same dislike to suitors' kisses;
     The odds are that he finds a handsome urn
       To his memory--and two or three young misses
     Born to some friend, who holds his wife and riches,--
     And that his Argus--bites him by the breeches.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If single, probably his plighted fair
       Has in his absence wedded some rich miser;
     But all the better, for the happy pair
       May quarrel, and the lady growing wiser,
     He may resume his amatory care
       As cavalier servente, or despise her;
     And that his sorrow may not be a dumb one,
     Write odes on the Inconstancy of Woman.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And oh! ye gentlemen who have already
       Some chaste liaison of the kind--I mean
     An honest friendship with a married lady--
       The only thing of this sort ever seen
     To last--of all connections the most steady,
       And the true Hymen (the first 's but a screen)--
     Yet for all that keep not too long away,
     I 've known the absent wrong'd four times a day.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Lambro, our sea-solicitor, who had
       Much less experience of dry land than ocean,
     On seeing his own chimney-smoke, felt glad;
       But not knowing metaphysics, had no notion
     Of the true reason of his not being sad,
       Or that of any other strong emotion;
     He loved his child, and would have wept the loss of her,
     But knew the cause no more than a philosopher.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He saw his white walls shining in the sun,
       His garden trees all shadowy and green;
     He heard his rivulet's light bubbling run,
       The distant dog-bark; and perceived between
     The umbrage of the wood so cool and dun
       The moving figures, and the sparkling sheen
     Of arms (in the East all arm)--and various dyes
     Of colour'd garbs, as bright as butterflies.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And as the spot where they appear he nears,
       Surprised at these unwonted signs of idling,
     He hears--alas! no music of the spheres,
       But an unhallow'd, earthly sound of fiddling!
     A melody which made him doubt his ears,
       The cause being past his guessing or unriddling;
     A pipe, too, and a drum, and shortly after,
     A most unoriental roar of laughter.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And still more nearly to the place advancing,
       Descending rather quickly the declivity,
     Through the waved branches o'er the greensward glancing,
       'Midst other indications of festivity,
     Seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
       Like dervises, who turn as on a pivot, he
     Perceived it was the Pyrrhic dance so martial,
     To which the Levantines are very partial.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And further on a group of Grecian girls,
       The first and tallest her white kerchief waving,
     Were strung together like a row of pearls,
       Link'd hand in hand, and dancing; each too having
     Down her white neck long floating auburn curls
       (The least of which would set ten poets raving);
     Their leader sang--and bounded to her song,
     With choral step and voice, the virgin throng.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And here, assembled cross-legg'd round their trays,
       Small social parties just begun to dine;
     Pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze,
       And flasks of Samian and of Chian wine,
     And sherbet cooling in the porous vase;
       Above them their dessert grew on its vine,
     The orange and pomegranate nodding o'er
     Dropp'd in their laps, scarce pluck'd, their mellow store.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A band of children, round a snow-white ram,
       There wreathe his venerable horns with flowers;
     While peaceful as if still an unwean'd lamb,
       The patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
     His sober head, majestically tame,
       Or eats from out the palm, or playful lowers
     His brow, as if in act to butt, and then
     Yielding to their small hands, draws back again.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Their classical profiles, and glittering dresses,
       Their large black eyes, and soft seraphic cheeks,
     Crimson as cleft pomegranates, their long tresses,
       The gesture which enchants, the eye that speaks,
     The innocence which happy childhood blesses,
       Made quite a picture of these little Greeks;
     So that the philosophical beholder
     Sigh'd for their sakes--that they should e'er grow older.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Afar, a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
       To a sedate grey circle of old smokers,
     Of secret treasures found in hidden vales,
       Of wonderful replies from Arab jokers,
     Of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails,
       Of rocks bewitch'd that open to the knockers,
     Of magic ladies who, by one sole act,
     Transform'd their lords to beasts (but that 's a fact).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Here was no lack of innocent diversion
       For the imagination or the senses,
     Song, dance, wine, music, stories from the Persian,
       All pretty pastimes in which no offence is;
     But Lambro saw all these things with aversion,
       Perceiving in his absence such expenses,
     Dreading that climax of all human ills,
     The inflammation of his weekly bills.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Ah! what is man? what perils still environ
       The happiest mortals even after dinner--
     A day of gold from out an age of iron
       Is all that life allows the luckiest sinner;
     Pleasure (whene'er she sings, at least) 's a siren,
       That lures, to flay alive, the young beginner;
     Lambro's reception at his people's banquet
     Was such as fire accords to a wet blanket.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He--being a man who seldom used a word
       Too much, and wishing gladly to surprise
     (In general he surprised men with the sword)
       His daughter--had not sent before to advise
     Of his arrival, so that no one stirr'd;
       And long he paused to re-assure his eyes
     In fact much more astonish'd than delighted,
     To find so much good company invited.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He did not know (alas! how men will lie)
       That a report (especially the Greeks)
     Avouch'd his death (such people never die),
       And put his house in mourning several weeks,--
     But now their eyes and also lips were dry;
       The bloom, too, had return'd to Haidee's cheeks,
     Her tears, too, being return'd into their fount,
     She now kept house upon her own account.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Hence all this rice, meat, dancing, wine, and fiddling,
       Which turn'd the isle into a place of pleasure;
     The servants all were getting drunk or idling,
       A life which made them happy beyond measure.
     Her father's hospitality seem'd middling,
       Compared with what Haidee did with his treasure;
     'T was wonderful how things went on improving,
     While she had not one hour to spare from loving.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
       He flew into a passion, and in fact
     There was no mighty reason to be pleased;
       Perhaps you prophesy some sudden act,
     The whip, the rack, or dungeon at the least,
       To teach his people to be more exact,
     And that, proceeding at a very high rate,
     He show'd the royal penchants of a pirate.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     You 're wrong.--He was the mildest manner'd man
       That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat:
     With such true breeding of a gentleman,
       You never could divine his real thought;
     No courtier could, and scarcely woman can
       Gird more deceit within a petticoat;
     Pity he loved adventurous life's variety,
     He was so great a loss to good society.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Advancing to the nearest dinner tray,
       Tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest,
     With a peculiar smile, which, by the way,
       Boded no good, whatever it express'd,
     He ask'd the meaning of this holiday;
       The vinous Greek to whom he had address'd
     His question, much too merry to divine
     The questioner, fill'd up a glass of wine,

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And without turning his facetious head,
       Over his shoulder, with a Bacchant air,
     Presented the o'erflowing cup, and said,
       'Talking 's dry work, I have no time to spare.'
     A second hiccup'd, 'Our old master 's dead,
       You 'd better ask our mistress who 's his heir.'
     'Our mistress!' quoth a third: 'Our mistress!--pooh!-
     You mean our master--not the old, but new.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     These rascals, being new comers, knew not whom
       They thus address'd--and Lambro's visage fell--
     And o'er his eye a momentary gloom
       Pass'd, but he strove quite courteously to quell
     The expression, and endeavouring to resume
       His smile, requested one of them to tell
     The name and quality of his new patron,
     Who seem'd to have turn'd Haidee into a matron.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'I know not,' quoth the fellow, 'who or what
       He is, nor whence he came--and little care;
     But this I know, that this roast capon 's fat,
       And that good wine ne'er wash'd down better fare;
     And if you are not satisfied with that,
       Direct your questions to my neighbour there;
     He 'll answer all for better or for worse,
     For none likes more to hear himself converse.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I said that Lambro was a man of patience,
       And certainly he show'd the best of breeding,
     Which scarce even France, the paragon of nations,
       E'er saw her most polite of sons exceeding;
     He bore these sneers against his near relations,
       His own anxiety, his heart, too, bleeding,
     The insults, too, of every servile glutton,
     Who all the time was eating up his mutton.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now in a person used to much command--
       To bid men come, and go, and come again--
     To see his orders done, too, out of hand--
       Whether the word was death, or but the chain--
     It may seem strange to find his manners bland;
       Yet such things are, which I can not explain,
     Though doubtless he who can command himself
     Is good to govern--almost as a Guelf.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Not that he was not sometimes rash or so,
       But never in his real and serious mood;
     Then calm, concentrated, and still, and slow,
       He lay coil'd like the boa in the wood;
     With him it never was a word and blow,
       His angry word once o'er, he shed no blood,
     But in his silence there was much to rue,
     And his one blow left little work for two.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He ask'd no further questions, and proceeded
       On to the house, but by a private way,
     So that the few who met him hardly heeded,
       So little they expected him that day;
     If love paternal in his bosom pleaded
       For Haidee's sake, is more than I can say,
     But certainly to one deem'd dead, returning,
     This revel seem'd a curious mode of mourning.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If all the dead could now return to life
       (Which God forbid!) or some, or a great many,
     For instance, if a husband or his wife
       (Nuptial examples are as good as any),
     No doubt whate'er might be their former strife,
       The present weather would be much more rainy--
     Tears shed into the grave of the connection
     Would share most probably its resurrection.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He enter'd in the house no more his home,
       A thing to human feelings the most trying,
     And harder for the heart to overcome,
       Perhaps, than even the mental pangs of dying;
     To find our hearthstone turn'd into a tomb,
       And round its once warm precincts palely lying
     The ashes of our hopes, is a deep grief,
     Beyond a single gentleman's belief.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He enter'd in the house--his home no more,
       For without hearts there is no home; and felt
     The solitude of passing his own door
       Without a welcome; there he long had dwelt,
     There his few peaceful days Time had swept o'er,
       There his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
     Over the innocence of that sweet child,
     His only shrine of feelings undefiled.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He was a man of a strange temperament,
       Of mild demeanour though of savage mood,
     Moderate in all his habits, and content
       With temperance in pleasure, as in food,
     Quick to perceive, and strong to bear, and meant
       For something better, if not wholly good;
     His country's wrongs and his despair to save her
     Had stung him from a slave to an enslaver.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The love of power, and rapid gain of gold,
       The hardness by long habitude produced,
     The dangerous life in which he had grown old,
       The mercy he had granted oft abused,
     The sights he was accustom'd to behold,
       The wild seas, and wild men with whom he cruised,
     Had cost his enemies a long repentance,
     And made him a good friend, but bad acquaintance.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But something of the spirit of old Greece
       Flash'd o'er his soul a few heroic rays,
     Such as lit onward to the Golden Fleece
       His predecessors in the Colchian days;
     T is true he had no ardent love for peace--
       Alas! his country show'd no path to praise:
     Hate to the world and war with every nation
     He waged, in vengeance of her degradation.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Still o'er his mind the influence of the clime
       Shed its Ionian elegance, which show'd
     Its power unconsciously full many a time,--
       A taste seen in the choice of his abode,
     A love of music and of scenes sublime,
       A pleasure in the gentle stream that flow'd
     Past him in crystal, and a joy in flowers,
     Bedew'd his spirit in his calmer hours.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But whatsoe'er he had of love reposed
       On that beloved daughter; she had been
     The only thing which kept his heart unclosed
       Amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen;
     A lonely pure affection unopposed:
       There wanted but the loss of this to wean
     His feelings from all milk of human kindness,
     And turn him like the Cyclops mad with blindness.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The cubless tigress in her jungle raging
       Is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock;
     The ocean when its yeasty war is waging
       Is awful to the vessel near the rock;
     But violent things will sooner bear assuaging,
       Their fury being spent by its own shock,
     Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire
     Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It is a hard although a common case
       To find our children running restive--they
     In whom our brightest days we would retrace,
       Our little selves re-form'd in finer clay,
     Just as old age is creeping on apace,
       And clouds come o'er the sunset of our day,
     They kindly leave us, though not quite alone,
     But in good company--the gout or stone.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet a fine family is a fine thing
       (Provided they don't come in after dinner);
     'T is beautiful to see a matron bring
       Her children up (if nursing them don't thin her);
     Like cherubs round an altar-piece they cling
       To the fire-side (a sight to touch a sinner).
     A lady with her daughters or her nieces
     Shines like a guinea and seven-shilling pieces.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Old Lambro pass'd unseen a private gate,
       And stood within his hall at eventide;
     Meantime the lady and her lover sate
       At wassail in their beauty and their pride:
     An ivory inlaid table spread with state
       Before them, and fair slaves on every side;
     Gems, gold, and silver, form'd the service mostly,
     Mother of pearl and coral the less costly.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The dinner made about a hundred dishes;
       Lamb and pistachio nuts--in short, all meats,
     And saffron soups, and sweetbreads; and the fishes
       Were of the finest that e'er flounced in nets,
     Drest to a Sybarite's most pamper'd wishes;
       The beverage was various sherbets
     Of raisin, orange, and pomegranate juice,
     Squeezed through the rind, which makes it best for use.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     These were ranged round, each in its crystal ewer,
       And fruits, and date-bread loaves closed the repast,
     And Mocha's berry, from Arabia pure,
       In small fine China cups, came in at last;
     Gold cups of filigree made to secure
       The hand from burning underneath them placed,
     Cloves, cinnamon, and saffron too were boil'd
     Up with the coffee, which (I think) they spoil'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The hangings of the room were tapestry, made
       Of velvet panels, each of different hue,
     And thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid;
       And round them ran a yellow border too;
     The upper border, richly wrought, display'd,
       Embroider'd delicately o'er with blue,
     Soft Persian sentences, in lilac letters,
     From poets, or the moralists their betters.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     These Oriental writings on the wall,
       Quite common in those countries, are a kind
     Of monitors adapted to recall,
       Like skulls at Memphian banquets, to the mind
     The words which shook Belshazzar in his hall,
       And took his kingdom from him: You will find,
     Though sages may pour out their wisdom's treasure,
     There is no sterner moralist than Pleasure.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A beauty at the season's close grown hectic,
       A genius who has drunk himself to death,
     A rake turn'd methodistic, or Eclectic
       (For that 's the name they like to pray beneath)--
     But most, an alderman struck apoplectic,
       Are things that really take away the breath,--
     And show that late hours, wine, and love are able
     To do not much less damage than the table.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Haidee and Juan carpeted their feet
       On crimson satin, border'd with pale blue;
     Their sofa occupied three parts complete
       Of the apartment--and appear'd quite new;
     The velvet cushions (for a throne more meet)
       Were scarlet, from whose glowing centre grew
     A sun emboss'd in gold, whose rays of tissue,
     Meridian-like, were seen all light to issue.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Crystal and marble, plate and porcelain,
       Had done their work of splendour; Indian mats
     And Persian carpets, which the heart bled to stain,
       Over the floors were spread; gazelles and cats,
     And dwarfs and blacks, and such like things, that gain
       Their bread as ministers and favourites (that 's
     To say, by degradation) mingled there
     As plentiful as in a court, or fair.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There was no want of lofty mirrors, and
       The tables, most of ebony inlaid
     With mother of pearl or ivory, stood at hand,
       Or were of tortoise-shell or rare woods made,
     Fretted with gold or silver:--by command,
       The greater part of these were ready spread
     With viands and sherbets in ice--and wine--
     Kept for all comers at all hours to dine.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Of all the dresses I select Haidee's:
       She wore two jelicks--one was of pale yellow;
     Of azure, pink, and white was her chemise--
       'Neath which her breast heaved like a little billow;
     With buttons form'd of pearls as large as peas,
       All gold and crimson shone her jelick's fellow,
     And the striped white gauze baracan that bound her,
     Like fleecy clouds about the moon, flow'd round her.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     One large gold bracelet clasp'd each lovely arm,
       Lockless--so pliable from the pure gold
     That the hand stretch'd and shut it without harm,
       The limb which it adorn'd its only mould;
     So beautiful--its very shape would charm;
       And, clinging as if loath to lose its hold,
     The purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
     That e'er by precious metal was held in.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Around, as princess of her father's land,
       A like gold bar above her instep roll'd
     Announced her rank; twelve rings were on her hand;
       Her hair was starr'd with gems; her veil's fine fold
     Below her breast was fasten'd with a band
       Of lavish pearls, whose worth could scarce be told;
     Her orange silk full Turkish trousers furl'd
     About the prettiest ankle in the world.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her hair's long auburn waves down to her heel
       Flow'd like an Alpine torrent which the sun
     Dyes with his morning light,--and would conceal
       Her person if allow'd at large to run,
     And still they seem resentfully to feel
       The silken fillet's curb, and sought to shun
     Their bonds whene'er some Zephyr caught began
     To offer his young pinion as her fan.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Round her she made an atmosphere of life,
       The very air seem'd lighter from her eyes,
     They were so soft and beautiful, and rife
       With all we can imagine of the skies,
     And pure as Psyche ere she grew a wife--
       Too pure even for the purest human ties;
     Her overpowering presence made you feel
     It would not be idolatry to kneel.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her eyelashes, though dark as night, were tinged
       (It is the country's custom), but in vain;
     For those large black eyes were so blackly fringed,
       The glossy rebels mock'd the jetty stain,
     And in their native beauty stood avenged:
       Her nails were touch'd with henna; but again
     The power of art was turn'd to nothing, for
     They could not look more rosy than before.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The henna should be deeply dyed to make
       The skin relieved appear more fairly fair;
     She had no need of this, day ne'er will break
       On mountain tops more heavenly white than her:
     The eye might doubt if it were well awake,
       She was so like a vision; I might err,
     But Shakspeare also says, 't is very silly
     'To gild refined gold, or paint the lily'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan had on a shawl of black and gold,
       But a white baracan, and so transparent
     The sparkling gems beneath you might behold,
       Like small stars through the milky way apparent;
     His turban, furl'd in many a graceful fold,
       An emerald aigrette with Haidee's hair in 't
     Surmounted as its clasp--a glowing crescent,
     Whose rays shone ever trembling, but incessant.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And now they were diverted by their suite,
       Dwarfs, dancing girls, black eunuchs, and a poet,
     Which made their new establishment complete;
       The last was of great fame, and liked to show it:
     His verses rarely wanted their due feet;
       And for his theme--he seldom sung below it,
     He being paid to satirize or flatter,
     As the psalm says, 'inditing a good matter.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He praised the present, and abused the past,
       Reversing the good custom of old days,
     An Eastern anti-jacobin at last
       He turn'd, preferring pudding to no praise--
     For some few years his lot had been o'ercast
       By his seeming independent in his lays,
     But now he sung the Sultan and the Pacha
     With truth like Southey, and with verse like Crashaw.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He was a man who had seen many changes,
       And always changed as true as any needle;
     His polar star being one which rather ranges,
       And not the fix'd--he knew the way to wheedle:
     So vile he 'scaped the doom which oft avenges;
       And being fluent (save indeed when fee'd ill),
     He lied with such a fervour of intention--
     There was no doubt he earn'd his laureate pension.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But he had genius,--when a turncoat has it,
       The 'Vates irritabilis' takes care
     That without notice few full moons shall pass it;
       Even good men like to make the public stare:--
     But to my subject--let me see--what was it?-
       O!--the third canto--and the pretty pair--
     Their loves, and feasts, and house, and dress, and mode
     Of living in their insular abode.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Their poet, a sad trimmer, but no less
       In company a very pleasant fellow,
     Had been the favourite of full many a mess
       Of men, and made them speeches when half mellow;
     And though his meaning they could rarely guess,
       Yet still they deign'd to hiccup or to bellow
     The glorious meed of popular applause,
     Of which the first ne'er knows the second cause.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But now being lifted into high society,
       And having pick'd up several odds and ends
     Of free thoughts in his travels for variety,
       He deem'd, being in a lone isle, among friends,
     That, without any danger of a riot, he
       Might for long lying make himself amends;
     And, singing as he sung in his warm youth,
     Agree to a short armistice with truth.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He had travell'd 'mongst the Arabs, Turks, and Franks,
       And knew the self-loves of the different nations;
     And having lived with people of all ranks,
       Had something ready upon most occasions--
     Which got him a few presents and some thanks.
       He varied with some skill his adulations;
     To 'do at Rome as Romans do,' a piece
     Of conduct was which he observed in Greece.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thus, usually, when he was ask'd to sing,
       He gave the different nations something national;
     'T was all the same to him--'God save the king,'
       Or 'Ca ira,' according to the fashion all:
     His muse made increment of any thing,
       From the high lyric down to the low rational:
     If Pindar sang horse-races, what should hinder
     Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
       In England a six canto quarto tale;
     In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
       The last war--much the same in Portugal;
     In Germany, the Pegasus he 'd prance on
       Would be old Goethe's (see what says De Stael);
     In Italy he 'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
     In Greece, he sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye:

RHYME a b a b c c 

           The isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece!
             Where burning Sappho loved and sung,
           Where grew the arts of war and peace,
             Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!
           Eternal summer gilds them yet,
           But all, except their sun, is set.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           The Scian and the Teian muse,
             The hero's harp, the lover's lute,
           Have found the fame your shores refuse;
             Their place of birth alone is mute
           To sounds which echo further west
           Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.'

RHYME a b a b c c 

           The mountains look on Marathon--
             And Marathon looks on the sea;
           And musing there an hour alone,
             I dream'd that Greece might still be free;
           For standing on the Persians' grave,
           I could not deem myself a slave.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           A king sate on the rocky brow
             Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;
           And ships, by thousands, lay below,
             And men in nations;--all were his!
           He counted them at break of day--
           And when the sun set where were they?

RHYME a b a b c c 

           And where are they? and where art thou,
             My country? On thy voiceless shore
           The heroic lay is tuneless now--
             The heroic bosom beats no more!
           And must thy lyre, so long divine,
           Degenerate into hands like mine?

RHYME a b a b c c 

           'T is something, in the dearth of fame,
             Though link'd among a fetter'd race,
           To feel at least a patriot's shame,
             Even as I sing, suffuse my face;
           For what is left the poet here?
           For Greeks a blush--for Greece a tear.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           Must we but weep o'er days more blest?
             Must we but blush?--Our fathers bled.
           Earth! render back from out thy breast
             A remnant of our Spartan dead!
           Of the three hundred grant but three,
           To make a new Thermopylae!

RHYME a b a b c c 

           What, silent still? and silent all?
             Ah! no;--the voices of the dead
           Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
             And answer, 'Let one living head,
           But one arise,--we come, we come!'
           'T is but the living who are dumb.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           In vain--in vain: strike other chords;
             Fill high the cup with Samian wine!
           Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,
             And shed the blood of Scio's vine!
           Hark! rising to the ignoble call--
           How answers each bold Bacchanal!

RHYME a b a b c c 

           You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,
             Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?
           Of two such lessons, why forget
             The nobler and the manlier one?
           You have the letters Cadmus gave--
           Think ye he meant them for a slave?

RHYME a b a b c c 

           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             We will not think of themes like these!
           It made Anacreon's song divine:
             He served--but served Polycrates--
           A tyrant; but our masters then
           Were still, at least, our countrymen.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           The tyrant of the Chersonese
             Was freedom's best and bravest friend;
           That tyrant was Miltiades!
             O! that the present hour would lend
           Another despot of the kind!
           Such chains as his were sure to bind.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,
           Exists the remnant of a line
             Such as the Doric mothers bore;
           And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,
           The Heracleidan blood might own.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           Trust not for freedom to the Franks--
             They have a king who buys and sells;
           In native swords, and native ranks,
             The only hope of courage dwells;
           But Turkish force, and Latin fraud,
           Would break your shield, however broad.

RHYME a b a b c c 

           Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!
             Our virgins dance beneath the shade--
           I see their glorious black eyes shine;
             But gazing on each glowing maid,
           My own the burning tear-drop laves,
           To think such breasts must suckle slaves

RHYME a b a b c c 

           Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,
             Where nothing, save the waves and I,
           May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;
             There, swan-like, let me sing and die:
           A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine--
           Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thus sung, or would, or could, or should have sung,
       The modern Greek, in tolerable verse;
     If not like Orpheus quite, when Greece was young,
       Yet in these times he might have done much worse:
     His strain display'd some feeling--right or wrong;
       And feeling, in a poet, is the source
     Of others' feeling; but they are such liars,
     And take all colours--like the hands of dyers.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But words are things, and a small drop of ink,
       Falling like dew, upon a thought, produces
     That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think;
       'T is strange, the shortest letter which man uses
     Instead of speech, may form a lasting link
       Of ages; to what straits old Time reduces
     Frail man, when paper--even a rag like this,
     Survives himself, his tomb, and all that 's his.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And when his bones are dust, his grave a blank,
       His station, generation, even his nation,
     Become a thing, or nothing, save to rank
       In chronological commemoration,
     Some dull MS. oblivion long has sank,
       Or graven stone found in a barrack's station
     In digging the foundation of a closet,
     May turn his name up, as a rare deposit.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And glory long has made the sages smile;
       'T is something, nothing, words, illusion, wind--
     Depending more upon the historian's style
       Than on the name a person leaves behind:
     Troy owes to Homer what whist owes to Hoyle:
       The present century was growing blind
     To the great Marlborough's skill in giving knocks,
     Until his late life by Archdeacon Coxe.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Milton 's the prince of poets--so we say;
       A little heavy, but no less divine:
     An independent being in his day--
       Learn'd, pious, temperate in love and wine;
     But, his life falling into Johnson's way,
       We 're told this great high priest of all the Nine
     Was whipt at college--a harsh sire--odd spouse,
     For the first Mrs. Milton left his house.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All these are, certes, entertaining facts,
       Like Shakspeare's stealing deer, Lord Bacon's bribes;
     Like Titus' youth, and Caesar's earliest acts;
       Like Burns (whom Doctor Currie well describes);
     Like Cromwell's pranks;--but although truth exacts
       These amiable descriptions from the scribes,
     As most essential to their hero's story,
     They do not much contribute to his glory.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All are not moralists, like Southey, when
       He prated to the world of 'Pantisocracy;'
     Or Wordsworth unexcised, unhired, who then
       Season'd his pedlar poems with democracy;
     Or Coleridge, long before his flighty pen
       Let to the Morning Post its aristocracy;
     When he and Southey, following the same path,
     Espoused two partners (milliners of Bath).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Such names at present cut a convict figure,
       The very Botany Bay in moral geography;
     Their loyal treason, renegado rigour,
       Are good manure for their more bare biography.
     Wordsworth's last quarto, by the way, is bigger
       Than any since the birthday of typography;
     A drowsy frowzy poem, call'd the 'Excursion.'
     Writ in a manner which is my aversion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He there builds up a formidable dyke
       Between his own and others' intellect;
     But Wordsworth's poem, and his followers, like
       Joanna Southcote's Shiloh, and her sect,
     Are things which in this century don't strike
       The public mind,--so few are the elect;
     And the new births of both their stale virginities
     Have proved but dropsies, taken for divinities.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But let me to my story: I must own,
       If I have any fault, it is digression--
     Leaving my people to proceed alone,
       While I soliloquize beyond expression;
     But these are my addresses from the throne,
       Which put off business to the ensuing session:
     Forgetting each omission is a loss to
     The world, not quite so great as Ariosto.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I know that what our neighbours call 'longueurs'
       (We 've not so good a word, but have the thing
     In that complete perfection which ensures
       An epic from Bob Southey every spring),
     Form not the true temptation which allures
       The reader; but 't would not be hard to bring
     Some fine examples of the epopee,
     To prove its grand ingredient is ennui.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     We learn from Horace, 'Homer sometimes sleeps;'
       We feel without him, Wordsworth sometimes wakes,--
     To show with what complacency he creeps,
       With his dear 'Waggoners,' around his lakes.
     He wishes for 'a boat' to sail the deeps--
       Of ocean?--No, of air; and then he makes
     Another outcry for 'a little boat,'
     And drivels seas to set it well afloat.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If he must fain sweep o'er the ethereal plain,
       And Pegasus runs restive in his 'Waggon,'
     Could he not beg the loan of Charles's Wain?
       Or pray Medea for a single dragon?
     Or if, too classic for his vulgar brain,
       He fear'd his neck to venture such a nag on,
     And he must needs mount nearer to the moon,
     Could not the blockhead ask for a balloon?

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Pedlars,' and 'Boats,' and 'Waggons!' Oh! ye shades
       Of Pope and Dryden, are we come to this?
     That trash of such sort not alone evades
       Contempt, but from the bathos' vast abyss
     Floats scumlike uppermost, and these Jack Cades
       Of sense and song above your graves may hiss--
     The 'little boatman' and his 'Peter Bell'
     Can sneer at him who drew 'Achitophel'!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     T' our tale.--The feast was over, the slaves gone,
       The dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired;
     The Arab lore and poet's song were done,
       And every sound of revelry expired;
     The lady and her lover, left alone,
       The rosy flood of twilight's sky admired;--
     Ave Maria! o'er the earth and sea,
     That heavenliest hour of Heaven is worthiest thee!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Ave Maria! blessed be the hour!
       The time, the clime, the spot, where I so oft
     Have felt that moment in its fullest power
       Sink o'er the earth so beautiful and soft,
     While swung the deep bell in the distant tower,
       Or the faint dying day-hymn stole aloft,
     And not a breath crept through the rosy air,
     And yet the forest leaves seem'd stirr'd with prayer.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Ave Maria! 't is the hour of prayer!
       Ave Maria! 't is the hour of love!
     Ave Maria! may our spirits dare
       Look up to thine and to thy Son's above!
     Ave Maria! oh that face so fair!
       Those downcast eyes beneath the Almighty dove--
     What though 't is but a pictured image?--strike--
     That painting is no idol,--'t is too like.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some kinder casuists are pleased to say,
       In nameless print--that I have no devotion;
     But set those persons down with me to pray,
       And you shall see who has the properest notion
     Of getting into heaven the shortest way;
       My altars are the mountains and the ocean,
     Earth, air, stars,--all that springs from the great Whole,
     Who hath produced, and will receive the soul.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Sweet hour of twilight!--in the solitude
       Of the pine forest, and the silent shore
     Which bounds Ravenna's immemorial wood,
       Rooted where once the Adrian wave flow'd o'er,
     To where the last Caesarean fortress stood,
       Evergreen forest! which Boccaccio's lore
     And Dryden's lay made haunted ground to me,
     How have I loved the twilight hour and thee!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The shrill cicadas, people of the pine,
       Making their summer lives one ceaseless song,
     Were the sole echoes, save my steed's and mine,
       And vesper bell's that rose the boughs along;
     The spectre huntsman of Onesti's line,
       His hell-dogs, and their chase, and the fair throng
     Which learn'd from this example not to fly
     From a true lover,--shadow'd my mind's eye.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O, Hesperus! thou bringest all good things--
       Home to the weary, to the hungry cheer,
     To the young bird the parent's brooding wings,
       The welcome stall to the o'erlabour'd steer;
     Whate'er of peace about our hearthstone clings,
       Whate'er our household gods protect of dear,
     Are gather'd round us by thy look of rest;
     Thou bring'st the child, too, to the mother's breast.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
       Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
       Seeming to weep the dying day's decay;
     Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     When Nero perish'd by the justest doom
       Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd,
     Amidst the roar of liberated Rome,
       Of nations freed, and the world overjoy'd,
     Some hands unseen strew'd flowers upon his tomb:
       Perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
     Of feeling for some kindness done, when power
     Had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But I 'm digressing; what on earth has Nero,
       Or any such like sovereign buffoons,
     To do with the transactions of my hero,
       More than such madmen's fellow man--the moon's?
     Sure my invention must be down at zero,
       And I grown one of many 'wooden spoons'
     Of verse (the name with which we Cantabs please
     To dub the last of honours in degrees).

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I feel this tediousness will never do--
       'T is being too epic, and I must cut down
     (In copying) this long canto into two;
       They 'll never find it out, unless I own
     The fact, excepting some experienced few;
       And then as an improvement 't will be shown:
     I 'll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
     From Aristotle passim.--See poietikes.

TITLE Don Juan, IV

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

Nothing so difficult as a beginning
       In poesy, unless perhaps the end;
     For oftentimes when Pegasus seems winning
       The race, he sprains a wing, and down we tend,
     Like Lucifer when hurl'd from heaven for sinning;
       Our sin the same, and hard as his to mend,
     Being pride, which leads the mind to soar too far,
     Till our own weakness shows us what we are.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But Time, which brings all beings to their level,
       And sharp Adversity, will teach at last
     Man,�and, as we would hope,�perhaps the devil,
       That neither of their intellects are vast:
     While youth's hot wishes in our red veins revel,
       We know not this�the blood flows on too fast;
     But as the torrent widens towards the ocean,
     We ponder deeply on each past emotion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     As boy, I thought myself a clever fellow,
       And wish'd that others held the same opinion;
     They took it up when my days grew more mellow,
       And other minds acknowledged my dominion:
     Now my sere fancy 'falls into the yellow
       Leaf,' and Imagination droops her pinion,
     And the sad truth which hovers o'er my desk
     Turns what was once romantic to burlesque.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And if I laugh at any mortal thing,
       'T is that I may not weep; and if I weep,
     'T is that our nature cannot always bring
       Itself to apathy, for we must steep
     Our hearts first in the depths of Lethe's spring,
       Ere what we least wish to behold will sleep:
     Thetis baptized her mortal son in Styx;
     A mortal mother would on Lethe fix.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some have accused me of a strange design
       Against the creed and morals of the land,
     And trace it in this poem every line:
       I don't pretend that I quite understand
     My own meaning when I would be very fine;
       But the fact is that I have nothing plann'd,
     Unless it were to be a moment merry,
     A novel word in my vocabulary.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     To the kind reader of our sober clime
       This way of writing will appear exotic;
     Pulci was sire of the half-serious rhyme,
       Who sang when chivalry was more Quixotic,
     And revell'd in the fancies of the time,
       True knights, chaste dames, huge giants, kings despotic:
     But all these, save the last, being obsolete,
     I chose a modern subject as more meet.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     How I have treated it, I do not know;
       Perhaps no better than they have treated me
     Who have imputed such designs as show
       Not what they saw, but what they wish'd to see:
     But if it gives them pleasure, be it so;
       This is a liberal age, and thoughts are free:
     Meantime Apollo plucks me by the ear,
     And tells me to resume my story here.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Young Juan and his lady-love were left
       To their own hearts' most sweet society;
     Even Time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
       With his rude scythe such gentle bosoms; he
     Sigh'd to behold them of their hours bereft,
       Though foe to love; and yet they could not be
     Meant to grow old, but die in happy spring,
     Before one charm or hope had taken wing.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Their faces were not made for wrinkles, their
       Pure blood to stagnate, their great hearts to fail;
     The blank grey was not made to blast their hair,
       But like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
     They were all summer: lightning might assail
       And shiver them to ashes, but to trail
     A long and snake-like life of dull decay
     Was not for them�they had too little day.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They were alone once more; for them to be
       Thus was another Eden; they were never
     Weary, unless when separate: the tree
       Cut from its forest root of years�the river
     Damm'd from its fountain�the child from the knee
       And breast maternal wean'd at once for ever,�
     Would wither less than these two torn apart;
     Alas! there is no instinct like the heart�

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The heart�which may be broken: happy they!
       Thrice fortunate! who of that fragile mould,
     The precious porcelain of human clay,
       Break with the first fall: they can ne'er behold
     The long year link'd with heavy day on day,
       And all which must be borne, and never told;
     While life's strange principle will often lie
     Deepest in those who long the most to die.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Whom the gods love die young,' was said of yore,
       And many deaths do they escape by this:
     The death of friends, and that which slays even more�
       The death of friendship, love, youth, all that is,
     Except mere breath; and since the silent shore
       Awaits at last even those who longest miss
     The old archer's shafts, perhaps the early grave
     Which men weep over may be meant to save.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Haidee and Juan thought not of the dead�
       The heavens, and earth, and air, seem'd made for them:
     They found no fault with Time, save that he fled;
       They saw not in themselves aught to condemn:
     Each was the other's mirror, and but read
       Joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem,
     And knew such brightness was but the reflection
     Of their exchanging glances of affection.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The gentle pressure, and the thrilling touch,
       The least glance better understood than words,
     Which still said all, and ne'er could say too much;
       A language, too, but like to that of birds,
     Known but to them, at least appearing such
       As but to lovers a true sense affords;
     Sweet playful phrases, which would seem absurd
     To those who have ceased to hear such, or ne'er heard,�

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All these were theirs, for they were children still,
       And children still they should have ever been;
     They were not made in the real world to fill
       A busy character in the dull scene,
     But like two beings born from out a rill,
       A nymph and her beloved, all unseen
     To pass their lives in fountains and on flowers,
     And never know the weight of human hours.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Moons changing had roll'd on, and changeless found
       Those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
     As rarely they beheld throughout their round;
       And these were not of the vain kind which cloys,
     For theirs were buoyant spirits, never bound
       By the mere senses; and that which destroys
     Most love, possession, unto them appear'd
     A thing which each endearment more endear'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O beautiful! and rare as beautiful
       But theirs was love in which the mind delights
     To lose itself when the old world grows dull,
       And we are sick of its hack sounds and sights,
     Intrigues, adventures of the common school,
       Its petty passions, marriages, and flights,
     Where Hymen's torch but brands one strumpet more,
     Whose husband only knows her not a wh�re.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Hard words; harsh truth; a truth which many know.
       Enough.�The faithful and the fairy pair,
     Who never found a single hour too slow,
       What was it made them thus exempt from care?
     Young innate feelings all have felt below,
       Which perish in the rest, but in them were
     Inherent�what we mortals call romantic,
     And always envy, though we deem it frantic.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     This is in others a factitious state,
       An opium dream of too much youth and reading,
     But was in them their nature or their fate:
       No novels e'er had set their young hearts bleeding,
     For Haidee's knowledge was by no means great,
       And Juan was a boy of saintly breeding;
     So that there was no reason for their loves
     More than for those of nightingales or doves.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They gazed upon the sunset; 't is an hour
       Dear unto all, but dearest to their eyes,
     For it had made them what they were: the power
       Of love had first o'erwhelm'd them from such skies,
     When happiness had been their only dower,
       And twilight saw them link'd in passion's ties;
     Charm'd with each other, all things charm'd that brought
     The past still welcome as the present thought.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I know not why, but in that hour to-night,
       Even as they gazed, a sudden tremor came,
     And swept, as 't were, across their hearts' delight,
       Like the wind o'er a harp-string, or a flame,
     When one is shook in sound, and one in sight;
       And thus some boding flash'd through either frame,
     And call'd from Juan's breast a faint low sigh,
     While one new tear arose in Haidee's eye.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     That large black prophet eye seem'd to dilate
       And follow far the disappearing sun,
     As if their last day! of a happy date
       With his broad, bright, and dropping orb were gone;
     Juan gazed on her as to ask his fate�
       He felt a grief, but knowing cause for none,
     His glance inquired of hers for some excuse
     For feelings causeless, or at least abstruse.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She turn'd to him, and smiled, but in that sort
       Which makes not others smile; then turn'd aside:
     Whatever feeling shook her, it seem'd short,
       And master'd by her wisdom or her pride;
     When Juan spoke, too�it might be in sport�
       Of this their mutual feeling, she replied�
     'If it should be so,�but�it cannot be�
     Or I at least shall not survive to see.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan would question further, but she press'd
       His lip to hers, and silenced him with this,
     And then dismiss'd the omen from her breast,
       Defying augury with that fond kiss;
     And no doubt of all methods 't is the best:
       Some people prefer wine�'t is not amiss;
     I have tried both; so those who would a part take
     May choose between the headache and the heartache.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     One of the two, according to your choice,
       Woman or wine, you 'll have to undergo;
     Both maladies are taxes on our joys:
       But which to choose, I really hardly know;
     And if I had to give a casting voice,
       For both sides I could many reasons show,
     And then decide, without great wrong to either,
     It were much better to have both than neither.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan and Haidee gazed upon each other
       With swimming looks of speechless tenderness,
     Which mix'd all feelings, friend, child, lover, brother,
       All that the best can mingle and express
     When two pure hearts are pour'd in one another,
       And love too much, and yet can not love less;
     But almost sanctify the sweet excess
     By the immortal wish and power to bless.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Mix'd in each other's arms, and heart in heart,
       Why did they not then die?�they had lived too long
     Should an hour come to bid them breathe apart;
       Years could but bring them cruel things or wrong;
     The world was not for them, nor the world's art
       For beings passionate as Sappho's song;
     Love was born with them, in them, so intense,
     It was their very spirit�not a sense.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They should have lived together deep in woods,
       Unseen as sings the nightingale; they were
     Unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
       Call'd social, haunts of Hate, and Vice, and Care:
     How lonely every freeborn creature broods!
       The sweetest song-birds nestle in a pair;
     The eagle soars alone; the gull and crow
     Flock o'er their carrion, just like men below.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Now pillow'd cheek to cheek, in loving sleep,
       Haidee and Juan their siesta took,
     A gentle slumber, but it was not deep,
       For ever and anon a something shook
     Juan, and shuddering o'er his frame would creep;
       And Haidee's sweet lips murmur'd like a brook
     A wordless music, and her face so fair
     Stirr'd with her dream, as rose-leaves with the air.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Or as the stirring of a deep dear stream
       Within an Alpine hollow, when the wind
     Walks o'er it, was she shaken by the dream,
       The mystical usurper of the mind�
     O'erpowering us to be whate'er may seem
       Good to the soul which we no more can bind;
     Strange state of being! (for 't is still to be)
     Senseless to feel, and with seal'd eyes to see.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She dream'd of being alone on the sea-shore,
       Chain'd to a rock; she knew not how, but stir
     She could not from the spot, and the loud roar
       Grew, and each wave rose roughly, threatening her;
     And o'er her upper lip they seem'd to pour,
       Until she sobb'd for breath, and soon they were
     Foaming o'er her lone head, so fierce and high�
     Each broke to drown her, yet she could not die.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Anon�she was released, and then she stray'd
       O'er the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet,
     And stumbled almost every step she made;
       And something roll'd before her in a sheet,
     Which she must still pursue howe'er afraid:
       'T was white and indistinct, nor stopp'd to meet
     Her glance nor grasp, for still she gazed, and grasp'd,
     And ran, but it escaped her as she clasp'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The dream changed:�in a cave she stood, its walls
       Were hung with marble icicles, the work
     Of ages on its water-fretted halls,
       Where waves might wash, and seals might breed and lurk;
     Her hair was dripping, and the very balls
       Of her black eyes seem'd turn'd to tears, and mirk
     The sharp rocks look'd below each drop they caught,
     Which froze to marble as it fell,�she thought.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And wet, and cold, and lifeless at her feet,
       Pale as the foam that froth'd on his dead brow,
     Which she essay'd in vain to clear (how sweet
       Were once her cares, how idle seem'd they now!),
     Lay Juan, nor could aught renew the beat
       Of his quench'd heart; and the sea dirges low
     Rang in her sad ears like a mermaid's song,
     And that brief dream appear'd a life too long.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And gazing on the dead, she thought his face
       Faded, or alter'd into something new�
     Like to her father's features, till each trace�
       More like and like to Lambro's aspect grew�
     With all his keen worn look and Grecian grace;
       And starting, she awoke, and what to view?
     O! Powers of Heaven! what dark eye meets she there?
     'T is�'t is her father's�fix'd upon the pair!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then shrieking, she arose, and shrieking fell,
       With joy and sorrow, hope and fear, to see
     Him whom she deem'd a habitant where dwell
       The ocean-buried, risen from death, to be
     Perchance the death of one she loved too well:
       Dear as her father had been to Haidee,
     It was a moment of that awful kind�
     I have seen such�but must not call to mind.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Up Juan sprung to Haidee's bitter shriek,
       And caught her falling, and from off the wall
     Snatch'd down his sabre, in hot haste to wreak
       Vengeance on him who was the cause of all:
     Then Lambro, who till now forbore to speak,
       Smiled scornfully, and said, 'Within my call,
     A thousand scimitars await the word;
     Put up, young man, put up your silly sword.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And Haidee clung around him; 'Juan, 't is�
       'T is Lambro�'t is my father! Kneel with me�
     He will forgive us�yes�it must be�yes.
       O! dearest father, in this agony
     Of pleasure and of pain�even while I kiss
       Thy garment's hem with transport, can it be
     That doubt should mingle with my filial joy?
     Deal with me as thou wilt, but spare this boy.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     High and inscrutable the old man stood,
       Calm in his voice, and calm within his eye�
     Not always signs with him of calmest mood:
       He look'd upon her, but gave no reply;
     Then turn'd to Juan, in whose cheek the blood
       Oft came and went, as there resolved to die;
     In arms, at least, he stood, in act to spring
     On the first foe whom Lambro's call might bring.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Young man, your sword;' so Lambro once more said:
       Juan replied, 'Not while this arm is free.'
     The old man's cheek grew pale, but not with dread,
       And drawing from his belt a pistol, he
     Replied, 'Your blood be then on your own head.'
       Then look'd dose at the flint, as if to see
     'T was fresh�for he had lately used the lock�
     And next proceeded quietly to cock.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It has a strange quick jar upon the ear,
       That cocking of a pistol, when you know
     A moment more will bring the sight to bear
       Upon your person, twelve yards off, or so;
     A gentlemanly distance, not too near,
       If you have got a former friend for foe;
     But after being fired at once or twice,
     The ear becomes more Irish, and less nice.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Lambro presented, and one instant more
       Had stopp'd this Canto, and Don Juan's breath,
     When Haidee threw herself her boy before;
       Stern as her sire: 'On me,' she cried, 'let death
     Descend�the fault is mine; this fatal shore
       He found�but sought not. I have pledged my faith;
     I love him�I will die with him: I knew
     Your nature's firmness�know your daughter's too.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A minute past, and she had been all tears,
       And tenderness, and infancy; but now
     She stood as one who champion'd human fears�
       Pale, statue-like, and stern, she woo'd the blow;
     And tall beyond her sex, and their compeers,
       She drew up to her height, as if to show
     A fairer mark; and with a fix'd eye scann'd
     Her father's face�but never stopp'd his hand.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He gazed on her, and she on him; 't was strange
       How like they look'd! the expression was the same;
     Serenely savage, with a little change
       In the large dark eye's mutual-darted flame;
     For she, too, was as one who could avenge,
       If cause should be�a lioness, though tame.
     Her father's blood before her father's face
     Boil'd up, and proved her truly of his race.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I said they were alike, their features and
       Their stature, differing but in sex and years;
     Even to the delicacy of their hand
       There was resemblance, such as true blood wears;
     And now to see them, thus divided, stand
       In fix'd ferocity, when joyous tears
     And sweet sensations should have welcomed both,
     Show what the passions are in their full growth.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The father paused a moment, then withdrew
       His weapon, and replaced it; but stood still,
     And looking on her, as to look her through,
       'Not I,' he said, 'have sought this stranger's ill;
     Not I have made this desolation: few
       Would bear such outrage, and forbear to kill;
     But I must do my duty�how thou hast
     Done thine, the present vouches for the past.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Let him disarm; or, by my father's head,
       His own shall roll before you like a ball!'
     He raised his whistle, as the word he said,
       And blew; another answer'd to the call,
     And rushing in disorderly, though led,
       And arm'd from boot to turban, one and all,
     Some twenty of his train came, rank on rank;
     He gave the word,�'Arrest or slay the Frank.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Then, with a sudden movement, he withdrew
       His daughter; while compress'd within his clasp,
     'Twixt her and Juan interposed the crew;
       In vain she struggled in her father's grasp�
     His arms were like a serpent's coil: then flew
       Upon their prey, as darts an angry asp,
     The file of pirates; save the foremost, who
     Had fallen, with his right shoulder half cut through.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The second had his cheek laid open; but
       The third, a wary, cool old sworder, took
     The blows upon his cutlass, and then put
       His own well in; so well, ere you could look,
     His man was floor'd, and helpless at his foot,
       With the blood running like a little brook
     From two smart sabre gashes, deep and red�
     One on the arm, the other on the head.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then they bound him where he fell, and bore
       Juan from the apartment: with a sign
     Old Lambro bade them take him to the shore,
       Where lay some ships which were to sail at nine.
     They laid him in a boat, and plied the oar
       Until they reach'd some galliots, placed in line;
     On board of one of these, and under hatches,
     They stow'd him, with strict orders to the watches.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The world is full of strange vicissitudes,
       And here was one exceedingly unpleasant:
     A gentleman so rich in the world's goods,
       Handsome and young, enjoying all the present,
     Just at the very time when he least broods
       On such a thing is suddenly to sea sent,
     Wounded and chain'd, so that he cannot move,
     And all because a lady fell in love.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Here I must leave him, for I grow pathetic,
       Moved by the Chinese nymph of tears, green tea!
     Than whom Cassandra was not more prophetic;
       For if my pure libations exceed three,
     I feel my heart become so sympathetic,
       That I must have recourse to black Bohea:
     'T is pity wine should be so deleterious,
     For tea and coffee leave us much more serious,

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Unless when qualified with thee, Cogniac!
       Sweet Naiad of the Phlegethontic rill!
     Ah! why the liver wilt thou thus attack,
       And make, like other nymphs, thy lovers ill?
     I would take refuge in weak punch, but rack
       (In each sense of the word), whene'er I fill
     My mild and midnight beakers to the brim,
     Wakes me next morning with its synonym.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I leave Don Juan for the present, safe�
       Not sound, poor fellow, but severely wounded;
     Yet could his corporal pangs amount to half
       Of those with which his Haidee's bosom bounded?
     She was not one to weep, and rave, and chafe,
       And then give way, subdued because surrounded;
     Her mother was a Moorish maid, from Fez,
     Where all is Eden, or a wilderness.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There the large olive rains its amber store
       In marble fonts; there grain, and flower, and fruit,
     Gush from the earth until the land runs o'er;
       But there, too, many a poison-tree has root,
     And midnight listens to the lion's roar,
       And long, long deserts scorch the camel's foot,
     Or heaving whelm the helpless caravan;
     And as the soil is, so the heart of man.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Afric is all the sun's, and as her earth
       Her human day is kindled; full of power
     For good or evil, burning from its birth,
       The Moorish blood partakes the planet's hour,
     And like the soil beneath it will bring forth:
       Beauty and love were Haidee's mother's dower;
     But her large dark eye show'd deep Passion's force,
     Though sleeping like a lion near a source.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her daughter, temper'd with a milder ray,
       Like summer clouds all silvery, smooth, and fair,
     Till slowly charged with thunder they display
       Terror to earth, and tempest to the air,
     Had held till now her soft and milky way;
       But overwrought with passion and despair,
     The fire burst forth from her Numidian veins,
     Even as the Simoom sweeps the blasted plains.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The last sight which she saw was Juan's gore,
       And he himself o'ermaster'd and cut down;
     His blood was running on the very floor
       Where late he trod, her beautiful, her own;
     Thus much she view'd an instant and no more,�
       Her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan;
     On her sire's arm, which until now scarce held
     Her writhing, fell she like a cedar fell'd.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     A vein had burst, and her sweet lips' pure dyes
       Were dabbled with the deep blood which ran o'er;
     And her head droop'd as when the lily lies
       O'ercharged with rain: her summon'd handmaids bore
     Their lady to her couch with gushing eyes;
       Of herbs and cordials they produced their store,
     But she defied all means they could employ,
     Like one life could not hold, nor death destroy.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Days lay she in that state unchanged, though chill�
       With nothing livid, still her lips were red;
     She had no pulse, but death seem'd absent still;
       No hideous sign proclaim'd her surely dead;
     Corruption came not in each mind to kill
       All hope; to look upon her sweet face bred
     New thoughts of life, for it seem'd full of soul�
     She had so much, earth could not claim the whole.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The ruling passion, such as marble shows
       When exquisitely chisell'd, still lay there,
     But fix'd as marble's unchanged aspect throws
       O'er the fair Venus, but for ever fair;
     O'er the Laocoon's all eternal throes,
       And ever-dying Gladiator's air,
     Their energy like life forms all their fame,
     Yet looks not life, for they are still the same.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She woke at length, but not as sleepers wake,
       Rather the dead, for life seem'd something new,
     A strange sensation which she must partake
       Perforce, since whatsoever met her view
     Struck not on memory, though a heavy ache
       Lay at her heart, whose earliest beat still true
     Brought back the sense of pain without the cause,
     For, for a while, the furies made a pause.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She look'd on many a face with vacant eye,
       On many a token without knowing what;
     She saw them watch her without asking why,
       And reck'd not who around her pillow sat;
     Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh
       Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat
     Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave
     No sign, save breath, of having left the grave.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Her handmaids tended, but she heeded not;
       Her father watch'd, she turn'd her eyes away;
     She recognized no being, and no spot,
       However dear or cherish'd in their day;
     They changed from room to room�but all forgot�
       Gentle, but without memory she lay;
     At length those eyes, which they would fain be weaning
     Back to old thoughts, wax'd full of fearful meaning.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And then a slave bethought her of a harp;
       The harper came, and tuned his instrument;
     At the first notes, irregular and sharp,
       On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,
     Then to the wall she turn'd as if to warp
       Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent;
     And he begun a long low island song
     Of ancient days, ere tyranny grew strong.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
       In time to his old tune; he changed the theme,
     And sung of love; the fierce name struck through all
       Her recollection; on her flash'd the dream
     Of what she was, and is, if ye could call
       To be so being; in a gushing stream
     The tears rush'd forth from her o'erclouded brain,
     Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Short solace, vain relief!�thought came too quick,
       And whirl'd her brain to madness; she arose
     As one who ne'er had dwelt among the sick,
       And flew at all she met, as on her foes;
     But no one ever heard her speak or shriek,
       Although her paroxysm drew towards its dose;�
     Hers was a phrensy which disdain'd to rave,
     Even when they smote her, in the hope to save.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet she betray'd at times a gleam of sense;
       Nothing could make her meet her father's face,
     Though on all other things with looks intense
       She gazed, but none she ever could retrace;
     Food she refused, and raiment; no pretence
       Avail'd for either; neither change of place,
     Nor time, nor skill, nor remedy, could give her
     Senses to sleep�the power seem'd gone for ever.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Twelve days and nights she wither'd thus; at last,
       Without a groan, or sigh, or glance, to show
     A parting pang, the spirit from her past:
       And they who watch'd her nearest could not know
     The very instant, till the change that cast
       Her sweet face into shadow, dull and slow,
     Glazed o'er her eyes�the beautiful, the black�
     O! to possess such lustre�and then lack!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     She died, but not alone; she held within
       A second principle of life, which might
     Have dawn'd a fair and sinless child of sin;
       But closed its little being without light,
     And went down to the grave unborn, wherein
       Blossom and bough lie wither'd with one blight;
     In vain the dews of Heaven descend above
     The bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Thus lived�thus died she; never more on her
       Shall sorrow light, or shame. She was not made
     Through years or moons the inner weight to bear,
       Which colder hearts endure till they are laid
     By age in earth: her days and pleasures were
       Brief, but delightful�such as had not staid
     Long with her destiny; but she sleeps well
     By the sea-shore, whereon she loved to dwell.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     That isle is now all desolate and bare,
       Its dwellings down, its tenants pass'd away;
     None but her own and father's grave is there,
       And nothing outward tells of human clay;
     Ye could not know where lies a thing so fair,
       No stone is there to show, no tongue to say
     What was; no dirge, except the hollow sea's,
     Mourns o'er the beauty of the Cyclades.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But many a Greek maid in a loving song
       Sighs o'er her name; and many an islander
     With her sire's story makes the night less long;
       Valour was his, and beauty dwelt with her:
     If she loved rashly, her life paid for wrong�
       A heavy price must all pay who thus err,
     In some shape; let none think to fly the danger,
     For soon or late Love is his own avenger.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But let me change this theme which grows too sad,
       And lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf;
     I don't much like describing people mad,
       For fear of seeming rather touch'd myself�
     Besides, I 've no more on this head to add;
       And as my Muse is a capricious elf,
     We 'll put about, and try another tack
     With Juan, left half-kill'd some stanzas back.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Wounded and fetter'd, 'cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,'
       Some days and nights elapsed before that he
     Could altogether call the past to mind;
       And when he did, he found himself at sea,
     Sailing six knots an hour before the wind;
       The shores of Ilion lay beneath their lee�
     Another time he might have liked to see 'em,
     But now was not much pleased with Cape Sigaeum.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     There, on the green and village-cotted hill, is
       (Flank'd by the Hellespont and by the sea)
     Entomb'd the bravest of the brave, Achilles;
       They say so (Bryant says the contrary):
     And further downward, tall and towering still, is
       The tumulus�of whom? Heaven knows! 't may be
     Patroclus, Ajax, or Protesilaus�
     All heroes, who if living still would slay us.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     High barrows, without marble or a name,
       A vast, untill'd, and mountain-skirted plain,
     And Ida in the distance, still the same,
       And old Scamander (if 't is he) remain;
     The situation seems still form'd for fame�
       A hundred thousand men might fight again
     With case; but where I sought for Ilion's walls,
     The quiet sheep feeds, and the tortoise crawls;

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Troops of untended horses; here and there
       Some little hamlets, with new names uncouth;
     Some shepherds (unlike Paris) led to stare
       A moment at the European youth
     Whom to the spot their school-boy feelings bear;
       A turk, with beads in hand and pipe in mouth,
     Extremely taken with his own religion,
     Are what I found there�but the devil a Phrygian.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Don Juan, here permitted to emerge
       From his dull cabin, found himself a slave;
     Forlorn, and gazing on the deep blue surge,
       O'ershadow'd there by many a hero's grave;
     Weak still with loss of blood, he scarce could urge
       A few brief questions; and the answers gave
     No very satisfactory information
     About his past or present situation.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     He saw some fellow captives, who appear'd
       To be Italians, as they were in fact;
     From them, at least, their destiny he heard,
       Which was an odd one; a troop going to act
     In Sicily (all singers, duly rear'd
       In their vocation) had not been attack'd
     In sailing from Livorno by the pirate,
     But sold by the impresario at no high rate.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     By one of these, the buffo of the party,
       Juan was told about their curious case;
     For although destined to the Turkish mart, he
       Still kept his spirits up�at least his face;
     The little fellow really look'd quite hearty,
       And bore him with some gaiety and grace,
     Showing a much more reconciled demeanour,
     Than did the prima donna and the tenor.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     In a few words he told their hapless story,
       Saying, 'Our Machiavellian impresario,
     Making a signal off some promontory,
       Hail'd a strange brig�Corpo di Caio Mario!
     We were transferr'd on board her in a hurry,
       Without a Single scudo of salario;
     But if the Sultan has a taste for song,
     We will revive our fortunes before long.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'The prima donna, though a little old,
       And haggard with a dissipated life,
     And subject, when the house is thin, to cold,
       Has some good notes; and then the tenor's wife,
     With no great voice, is pleasing to behold;
       Last carnival she made a deal of strife
     By carrying off Count Cesare Cicogna
     From an old Roman princess at Bologna.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'And then there are the dancers; there 's the Nini,
       With more than one profession, gains by all;
     Then there 's that laughing slut the Pelegrini,
       She, too, was fortunate last carnival,
     And made at least five hundred good zecchini,
       But spends so fast, she has not now a paul;
     And then there 's the Grotesca�such a dancer!
     Where men have souls or bodies she must answer.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'As for the figuranti, they are like
       The rest of all that tribe; with here and there
     A pretty person, which perhaps may strike,
       The rest are hardly fitted for a fair;
     There 's one, though tall and stiffer than a pike,
       Yet has a sentimental kind of air
     Which might go far, but she don't dance with vigour;
     The more 's the pity, with her face and figure.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'As for the men, they are a middling set;
       The musico is but a crack'd old basin,
     But being qualified in one way yet,
       May the seraglio do to set his face in,
     And as a servant some preferment get;
       His singing I no further trust can place in:
     From all the Pope makes yearly 't would perplex
     To find three perfect pipes of the third sex.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'The tenor's voice is spoilt by affectation,
       And for the bass, the beast can only bellow;
     In fact, he had no singing education,
       An ignorant, noteless, timeless, tuneless fellow;
     But being the prima donna's near relation,
       Who swore his voice was very rich and mellow,
     They hired him, though to hear him you 'd believe
     An ass was practising recitative.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     ''T would not become myself to dwell upon
       My own merits, and though young�I see, Sir�you
     Have got a travell'd air, which speaks you one
       To whom the opera is by no means new:
     You 've heard of Raucocanti?�I 'm the man;
       The time may come when you may hear me too;
     You was not last year at the fair of Lugo,
     But next, when I 'm engaged to sing there�do go.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'Our baritone I almost had forgot,
       A pretty lad, but bursting with conceit;
     With graceful action, science not a jot,
       A voice of no great compass, and not sweet,
     He always is complaining of his lot,
       Forsooth, scarce fit for ballads in the street;
     In lovers' parts his passion more to breathe,
     Having no heart to show, he shows his teeth.'

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Here Raucocanti's eloquent recital
       Was interrupted by the pirate crew,
     Who came at stated moments to invite all
       The captives back to their sad berths; each threw
     A rueful glance upon the waves (which bright all
       From the blue skies derived a double blue,
     Dancing all free and happy in the sun),
     And then went down the hatchway one by one.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     They heard next day�that in the Dardanelles,
       Waiting for his Sublimity's firman,
     The most imperative of sovereign spells,
       Which every body does without who can,
     More to secure them in their naval cells,
       Lady to lady, well as man to man,
     Were to be chain'd and lotted out per couple,
     For the slave market of Constantinople.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     It seems when this allotment was made out,
       There chanced to be an odd male, and odd female,
     Who (after some discussion and some doubt,
       If the soprano might be deem'd to be male,
     They placed him o'er the women as a scout)
       Were link'd together, and it happen'd the male
     Was Juan,�who, an awkward thing at his age,
     Pair'd off with a Bacchante blooming visage.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     With Raucocanti lucklessly was chain'd
       The tenor; these two hated with a hate
     Found only on the stage, and each more pain'd
       With this his tuneful neighbour than his fate;
     Sad strife arose, for they were so cross-grain'd,
       Instead of bearing up without debate,
     That each pull'd different ways with many an oath,
     'Arcades ambo,' id est�blackguards both.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Juan's companion was a Romagnole,
       But bred within the March of old Ancona,
     With eyes that look'd into the very soul
       (And other chief points of a 'bella donna'),
     Bright�and as black and burning as a coal;
       And through her dear brunette complexion shone
     Great wish to please�a most attractive dower,
     Especially when added to the power.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But all that power was wasted upon him,
       For sorrow o'er each sense held stern command;
     Her eye might flash on his, but found it dim;
       And though thus chain'd, as natural her hand
     Touch'd his, nor that�nor any handsome limb
       (And she had some not easy to withstand)
     Could stir his pulse, or make his faith feel brittle;
     Perhaps his recent wounds might help a little.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     No matter; we should ne'er too much enquire,
       But facts are facts: no knight could be more true,
     And firmer faith no ladye�love desire;
       We will omit the proofs, save one or two:
     'T is said no one in hand 'can hold a fire
       By thought of frosty Caucasus;' but few,
     I really think; yet Juan's then ordeal
     Was more triumphant, and not much less real.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Here I might enter on a chaste description,
       Having withstood temptation in my youth,
     But hear that several people take exception
       At the first two books having too much truth;
     Therefore I 'll make Don Juan leave the ship soon,
       Because the publisher declares, in sooth,
     Through needles' eyes it easier for the camel is
     To pass, than those two cantos into families.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     'T is all the same to me; I 'm fond of yielding,
       And therefore leave them to the purer page
     Of Smollett, Prior, Ariosto, Fielding,
       Who say strange things for so correct an age;
     I once had great alacrity in wielding
       My pen, and liked poetic war to wage,
     And recollect the time when all this cant
     Would have provoked remarks which now it shan't.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     As boys love rows, my boyhood liked a squabble;
       But at this hour I wish to part in peace,
     Leaving such to the literary rabble:
       Whether my verse's fame be doom'd to cease
     While the right hand which wrote it still is able,
       Or of some centuries to take a lease,
     The grass upon my grave will grow as long,
     And sigh to midnight winds, but not to song.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Of poets who come down to us through distance
       Of time and tongues, the foster-babes of Fame,
     Life seems the smallest portion of existence;
       Where twenty ages gather o'er a name,
     'T is as a snowball which derives assistance
       From every flake, and yet rolls on the same,
     Even till an iceberg it may chance to grow;
     But, after all, 't is nothing but cold snow.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     And so great names are nothing more than nominal,
       And love of glory 's but an airy lust,
     Too often in its fury overcoming all
       Who would as 't were identify their dust
     From out the wide destruction, which, entombing all,
       Leaves nothing till 'the coming of the just'-
     Save change: I 've stood upon Achilles' tomb,
     And heard Troy doubted; time will doubt of Rome.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     The very generations of the dead
       Are swept away, and tomb inherits tomb,
     Until the memory of an age is fled,
       And, buried, sinks beneath its offspring's doom:
     Where are the epitaphs our fathers read?
       Save a few glean'd from the sepulchral gloom
     Which once-named myriads nameless lie beneath,
     And lose their own in universal death.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I canter by the spot each afternoon
       Where perish'd in his fame the hero-boy,
     Who lived too long for men, but died too soon
       For human vanity, the young De Foix!
     A broken pillar, not uncouthly hewn,
       But which neglect is hastening to destroy,
     Records Ravenna's carnage on its face,
     While weeds and ordure rankle round the base.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     I pass each day where Dante's bones are laid:
       A little cupola, more neat than solemn,
     Protects his dust, but reverence here is paid
       To the bard's tomb, and not the warrior's column.
     The time must come, when both alike decay'd,
       The chieftain's trophy, and the poet's volume,
     Will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth,
     Before Pelides' death, or Homer's birth.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     With human blood that column was cemented,
       With human filth that column is defiled,
     As if the peasant's coarse contempt were vented
       To show his loathing of the spot he soil'd:
     Thus is the trophy used, and thus lamented
       Should ever be those blood-hounds, from whose wild
     Instinct of gore and glory earth has known
     Those sufferings Dante saw in hell alone.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet there will still be bards: though fame is smoke,
       Its fumes are frankincense to human thought;
     And the unquiet feelings, which first woke
       Song in the world, will seek what then they sought;
     As on the beach the waves at last are broke,
       Thus to their extreme verge the passions brought
     Dash into poetry, which is but passion,
     Or at least was so ere it grew a fashion.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     If in the course of such a life as was
       At once adventurous and contemplative,
     Men, who partake all passions as they pass,
       Acquire the deep and bitter power to give
     Their images again as in a glass,
       And in such colours that they seem to live;
     You may do right forbidding them to show 'em,
     But spoil (I think) a very pretty poem.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O! ye, who make the fortunes of all books!
       Benign Ceruleans of the second sex!
     Who advertise new poems by your looks,
       Your 'imprimatur' will ye not annex?
     What! must I go to the oblivious cooks,
       Those Cornish plunderers of Parnassian wrecks?
     Ah! must I then the only minstrel be,
     Proscribed from tasting your Castalian tea!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     What! can I prove 'a lion' then no more?
       A ball-room bard, a foolscap, hot-press darling?
     To bear the compliments of many a bore,
       And sigh, 'I can't get out,' like Yorick's starling;
     Why then I 'll swear, as poet Wordy swore
       (Because the world won't read him, always snarling),
     That taste is gone, that fame is but a lottery,
     Drawn by the blue-coat misses of a coterie.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     O! 'darkly, deeply, beautifully blue,'
       As some one somewhere sings about the sky,
     And I, ye learned ladies, say of you;
       They say your stockings are so (Heaven knows why,
     I have examined few pair of that hue);
       Blue as the garters which serenely lie
     Round the Patrician left-legs, which adorn
     The festal midnight, and the levee morn.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Yet some of you are most seraphic creatures�
       But times are alter'd since, a rhyming lover,
     You read my stanzas, and I read your features:
       And�but no matter, all those things are over;
     Still I have no dislike to learned natures,
       For sometimes such a world of virtues cover;
     I knew one woman of that purple school,
     The loveliest, chastest, best, but�quite a fool.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Humboldt, 'the first of travellers,' but not
       The last, if late accounts be accurate,
     Invented, by some name I have forgot,
       As well as the sublime discovery's date,
     An airy instrument, with which he sought
       To ascertain the atmospheric state,
     By measuring 'the intensity of blue:'
     O, Lady Daphne! let me measure you!

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But to the narrative:�The vessel bound
       With slaves to sell off in the capital,
     After the usual process, might be found
       At anchor under the seraglio wall;
     Her cargo, from the plague being safe and sound,
       Were landed in the market, one and all,
     And there with Georgians, Russians, and Circassians,
     Bought up for different purposes and passions.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
       For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
     Warranted virgin; beauty's brightest colours
       Had deck'd her out in all the hues of heaven:
     Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
       Who bade on till the hundreds reach'd eleven;
     But when the offer went beyond, they knew
     'T was for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     Twelve negresses from Nubia brought a price
       Which the West Indian market scarce would bring;
     Though Wilberforce, at last, has made it twice
       What 't was ere Abolition; and the thing
     Need not seem very wonderful, for vice
       Is always much more splendid than a king:
     The virtues, even the most exalted, Charity,
     Are saving�vice spares nothing for a rarity.

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     But for the destiny of this young troop,
       How some were bought by pachas, some by Jews,
     How some to burdens were obliged to stoop,
       And others rose to the command of crews
     As renegadoes; while in hapless group,
       Hoping no very old vizier might choose,
     The females stood, as one by one they pick'd 'em,
     To make a mistress, or fourth wife, or victim:

RHYME a b a b a b c c 

     All this must be reserved for further song;
       Also our hero's lot, howe'er unpleasant
     (Because this Canto has become too long),
       Must be postponed discreetly for the present;
     I 'm sensible redundancy is wrong,
       But could not for the muse of me put less in 't:
     And now delay the progress of Don Juan,
     Till what is call'd in Ossian the fifth Juan.

TITLE She Walks in Beauty

RHYME a b a b a b

SHE walks in beauty, like the night	
Of cloudless climes and starry skies,	
And all that�s best of dark and bright	
Meet in her aspect and her eyes;	
Thus mellow�d to that tender light	        
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.	
 
RHYME a b a b a b

One shade the more, one ray the less,	
Had half impair�d the nameless grace	
Which waves in every raven tress	
Or softly lightens o�er her face,	        
Where thoughts serenely sweet express	
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.	
 
RHYME a b a b a b

And on that cheek and o�er that brow	
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,	
The smiles that win, the tints that glow	        
But tell of days in goodness spent,�	
A mind at peace with all below,	
A heart whose love is innocent.

TITLE Elegy

RHYME a a b b a

O SNATCH�D away in beauty�s bloom!	
  On thee shall press no ponderous tomb;	
  But on thy turf shall roses rear	
  Their leaves, the earliest of the year,	
And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom:	        
 
RHYME a b a b b

  And oft by yon blue gushing stream	
  Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,	
  And feed deep thought with many a dream,	
  And lingering pause and lightly tread;	
Fond wretch! as if her step disturb�d the dead.	        

RHYME a b a b c c

  Away! we know that tears are vain,	
  That Death nor heeds nor hears distress:	
  Will this unteach us to complain?	
  Or make one mourner weep the less?	
  And thou, who tell�st me to forget,	        
Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.

TITLE To Augusta

RHYME a b a b c d c d
 
THOUGH the day of my destiny�s over,	
  And the star of my fate hath declined,	
Thy soft heart refused to discover	
  The faults which so many could find.	
Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted,	        
  It shrunk not to share it with me,	
And the love which my spirit hath painted	
  It never hath found but in thee.	
 
RHYME a b a b c d c d
 
Then when nature around me is smiling,	
  The last smile which answers to mine,	        
I do not believe it beguiling,	
  Because it reminds me of thine;	
And when winds are at war with the ocean,	
  As the breasts I believed in with me,	
If their billows excite an emotion,	        
  It is that they bear me from thee.	
 
RHYME a b a b c d c d
 
Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,	
  And its fragments are sunk in the wave,	
Though I feel that my soul is delivered	
  To pain�it shall not be its slave.	        
There is many a pang to pursue me:	
  They may crush, but they shall not contemn;	
They may torture, but shall not subdue me;	
  �Tis of thee that I think�not of them.	
 
RHYME a b a b c d c d
 
Though human, thou didst not deceive me,	        
  Though woman, thou didst not forsake,	
Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,	
  Though slander�d, thou never couldst shake;	
Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,	
  Though parted, it was not to fly,	        
Though watchful, �twas not to defame me,	
  Nor, mute, that the world might belie.	
 
RHYME a b a b c d c d
 
Yet I blame not the world, nor despise it,	
  Nor the war of the many with one;	
If my soul was not fitted to prize it,	        
  �Twas folly not sooner to shun:	
And if dearly that error hath cost me,	
  And more than I once could foresee,	
I have found that, whatever it lost me,	
  It could not deprive me of thee.	        
 
RHYME a b a b c d c d
 
From the wreck of the past, which hath perish�d,	
  Thus much I at least may recall,	
It hath taught me that what I most cherish�d	
  Deserved to be dearest of all:	
In the desert a fountain is springing,	        
  In the wide waste there still is a tree,	
And a bird in the solitude singing,	
  Which speaks to my spirit of thee.

TITLE Maid of Athens

RHYME a a b b c
RHYME-POEM a a b b c

MAID of Athens, ere we part,	
Give, oh, give me back my heart!	
Or, since that has left my breast,	
Keep it now, and take the rest!	
Hear my vow, before I go,	        
 
RHYME a a b b c
RHYME-POEM d d e e c

By those tresses unconfined,	
Woo�d by each �gean wind;	
By those lids whose jetty fringe	
Kiss thy soft cheeks� blooming tinge;	        
By those wild eyes like the roe,	
 
RHYME a a b b c
RHYME-POEM f f g g c

By that lip I long to taste;	
By that zone-encircled waist;	
By all the token-flowers that tell	        
What words can never speak so well;	
By love�s alternate joy and woe,	
 
RHYME a a b b c
RHYME-POEM h h i i c

Maid of Athens! I am gone:	
Think of me, sweet! when alone.	        
Though I fly to Istambol,	
Athens holds my heart and soul;	
Can I cease to love thee? No!

TITLE Longing

RHYME a b a b c b c b d d

THE CASTLED crag of Drachenfels	
Frowns o�er the wide and winding Rhine,	
Whose breast of waters broadly swells	
Between the banks which bear the vine.	
And hills all rich with blossom�d trees,	        
And fields which promise corn and wine,	
And scatter�d cities crowning these,	
Whose far white walls along them shine,	
Have strew�d a scene, which I should see	
With double joy wert thou with me.	        
 
RHYME a b a b c b c b d d

And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,	
And hands which offer early flowers,	
Walk smiling o�er this paradise:	
Above, the frequent feudal towers	
Through green leaves lift their walls of gray;	        
And many a rock which steeply lowers,	
And noble arch in proud decay,	
Look o�er this vale of vintage-bowers;	
But one thing want these banks of Rhine,�	
Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!	        
 
RHYME a b a b c b c b d d

I send the lilies given to me;	
Though long before thy hand they touch,	
I know that they must wither�d be,	
But yet reject them not as such;	
For I have cherish�d them as dear,	        
Because they yet may meet thine eye,	
And guide thy soul to mine even here,	
When thou behold�st them, drooping nigh,	
And know�st them gather�d by the Rhine,	
And offer�d from my heart to thine!	        
 
RHYME a b a b c b c b d d

The river nobly foams and flows,	
The charm of this enchanted ground,	
And all its thousand turns disclose	
Some fresher beauty varying round:	
The haughtiest breast its wish might bound	        
Through life to dwell delighted here;	
Nor could on earth a spot be found	
To nature and to me so dear,	
Could thy dear eyes in following mine	
Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!

TITLE Fare Thee Well

RHYME a b a b

FARE thee well! and if for ever,	
  Still for ever, fare thee well:	
Even though unforgiving, never	
  �Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.	
 
RHYME a b a b

Would that breast were bared before thee	        
  Where thy head so oft hath lain,	
While that placid sleep came o�er thee	
  Which thou ne�er canst know again:	
 
RHYME a b a b

Would that breast, by thee glanced over,	
  Every inmost thought could show!	        
Then thou wouldst at last discover	
  �Twas not well to spurn it so.	
 
RHYME a b a b

Though the world for this commend thee�	
  Though it smile upon the blow,	
Even its praises must offend thee,	        
  Founded on another�s woe:	
 
RHYME a b a b

Though my many faults defaced me,	
  Could no other arm be found,	
Than the one which once embraced me,	
  To inflict a cureless wound?	        
 
RHYME a b a b

Yet, oh yet, thyself deceive not;	
  Love may sink by slow decay,	
But by sudden wrench, believe not	
  Hearts can thus be torn away:	
 
RHYME a b a b

Still thine own its life retaineth,	        
  Still must mine, though bleeding, beat;	
And the undying thought which paineth	
  Is�that we no more may meet.	
 
RHYME a b a b

These are words of deeper sorrow	
  Than the wail above the dead;	        
Both shall live, but every morrow	
  Wake us from a widow�d bed.	
 
RHYME a b a b

And when thou wouldst solace gather,	
  When our child�s first accents flow,	
Wilt thou teach her to say �Father!�	        
  Though his care she must forego?	
 
RHYME a b a b

When her little hands shall press thee,	
  When her lip to thine is press�d,	
Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee,	
  Think of him thy love had bless�d!	        
 
RHYME a b a b

Should her lineaments resemble	
  Those thou never more may�st see,	
Then thy heart will softly tremble	
  With a pulse yet true to me.	
 
RHYME a b a b

All my faults perchance thou knowest,	        
  All my madness none can know;	
All my hopes, where�er thou goest,	
  Wither, yet with thee they go.	
 
RHYME a b a b

Every feeling hath been shaken;	
  Pride, which not a world could bow,	        
Bows to thee�by thee forsaken,	
  Even my soul forsakes me now:	
 
RHYME a b a b

But �tis done�all words are idle�	
  Words from me are vainer still;	
But the thoughts we cannot bridle	        
  Force their way without the will.	
 
RHYME a b a b

Fare thee well! thus disunited,	
  Torn from every nearer tie,	
Sear�d in heart, and lone, and blighted,	
  More than this I scarce can die.

TITLE On the Castle of Chillon

RHYME a b b a

ETERNAL SPIRIT of the chainless Mind!	
Brightest in dungeons, Liberty, thou art,�	
For there thy habitation is the heart�	
The heart which love of Thee alone can bind;	
 
RHYME a b b a

And when thy sons to fetters are consign�d,	        
To fetters, and the damp vault�s dayless gloom,	
Their country conquers with their martyrdom,	
And Freedom�s fame finds wings on every wind.	
 
RHYME a b a b a b

Chillon! thy prison is a holy place	
And thy sad floor an altar, for �twas trod,	        
Until his very steps have left a trace	
Worn as if thy cold pavement were a sod,	
By Bonnivard! May none those marks efface!	
For they appeal from tyranny to God.

TITLE Song of Saul

RHYME a a b b

WARRIORS and chiefs! should the shaft or the sword	
Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,	
Heed not the corse, though a king�s in your path:	
Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath!	
 
RHYME a a b b

Thou who art bearing my buckler and bow,	        
Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe,	
Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet!	
Mine be the doom which they dared not to meet.	
 
RHYME a a b b

Farewell to others, but never we part,	
Heir to my royalty, son of my heart!	        
Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway,	
Or kingly the death, which awaits us to-day!

TITLE On This Day I Complete My Thirty-Sixth Year

RHYME a b a b

�TIS time this heart should be unmoved,	
  Since others it hath ceased to move:	
Yet, though I cannot be beloved,	
      Still let me love!	
 
RHYME a b a b

My days are in the yellow leaf;	        
  The flowers and fruits of love are gone;	
The worm, the canker, and the grief	
      Are mine alone!	
 
RHYME a b a b

The fire that on my bosom preys	
  Is lone as some volcanic isle;	        
No torch is kindled at its blaze�	
      A funeral pile.	
 
RHYME a b a b

The hope, the fear, the jealous care,	
  The exalted portion of the pain	
And power of love, I cannot share,	        
      But wear the chain.	
 
RHYME a b a b

But �tis not thus�and �tis not here�	
  Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now,	
Where glory decks the hero�s bier,	
      Or binds his brow.	        
 
RHYME a b a b

The sword, the banner, and the field,	
  Glory and Greece, around me see!	
The Spartan, borne upon his shield,	
      Was not more free.	
 
RHYME a b a b

Awake! (not Greece�she is awake!)	        
  Awake, my spirit! Think through whom	
Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,	
      And then strike home!	
 
RHYME a b a b

Tread those reviving passions down,	
  Unworthy manhood!�unto thee	        
Indifferent should the smile or frown	
      Of beauty be.	
 
RHYME a b a b

If thou regret�st thy youth, why live?	
  The land of honourable death	
Is here:�up to the field, and give	        
      Away thy breath!	
 
RHYME a b a b

Seek out�less often sought than found�	
  A soldier�s grave, for thee the best;	
Then look around, and choose thy ground,	
      And take thy rest.

TITLE Elegy on Thyrza

RHYME a b a b c c b d d

AND thou art dead, as young and fair	
  As aught of mortal birth;	
And forms so soft and charms so rare	
  Too soon return�d to Earth!	
Though Earth received them in her bed,	        
And o�er the spot the crowd may tread	
  In carelessness or mirth,	
There is an eye which could not brook	
A moment on that grave to look.	
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

I will not ask where thou liest low	        
  Nor gaze upon the spot;	
There flowers or weeds at will may grow	
  So I behold them not:	
It is enough for me to prove	
That what I loved, and long must love	        
  Like common earth can rot;	
To me there needs no stone to tell	
�Tis Nothing that I loved so well.	
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

Yet did I love thee to the last,	
  As fervently as thou	        
Who didst not change through all the past	
  And canst not alter now.	
The love where Death has set his seal	
Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,	
  Nor falsehood disavow:	        
And, what were worse, thou canst not see	
Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.	
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

The better days of life were ours;	
  The worst can be but mine:	
The sun that cheers, the storm that lours,	        
  Shall never more be thine.	
The silence of that dreamless sleep	
I envy now too much to weep;	
  Nor need I to repine	
That all those charms have pass�d away	        
I might have watch�d through long decay.	
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

The flower in ripen�d bloom unmatch�d	
  Must fall the earliest prey;	
Though by no hand untimely snatch�d,	
  The leaves must drop away.	        
And yet it were a greater grief	
To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,	
  Than see it pluck�d today;	
Since earthly eye but ill can bear	
To trace the change to foul from fair.	        
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

I know not if I could have borne	
  To see thy beauties fade;	
The night that follow�d such a morn	
  Had worn a deeper shade:	
Thy day without a cloud hath past,	        
And thou wert lovely to the last,	
  Extinguish�d, not decay�d;	
As stars that shoot along the sky	
Shine brightest as they fall from high.	
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

As once I wept, if I could weep,	        
  My tears might well be shed	
To think I was not near, to keep	
  One vigil o�er thy bed:	
To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,	
To fold thee in a faint embrace,	        
  Uphold thy drooping head;	
And show that love, however vain,	
Nor thou nor I can feel again.	
 
RHYME a b a b c c b d d

Yet how much less it were to gain,	
  Though thou hast left me free,	        
The loveliest things that still remain	
  Than thus remember thee!	
The all of thine that cannot die	
Through dark and dread Eternity	
  Returns again to me,	        
And more thy buried love endears	
Than aught except its living years.

TITLE Youth and Age

RHYME a a b b

THERE�S not a joy the world can give like that it takes away	
When the glow of early thought declines in feeling�s dull decay;	
�Tis not on youth�s smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades so fast,	
But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past.	
 
RHYME a a b b

Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness	        
Are driven o�er the shoals of guilt, or ocean of excess:	
The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain	
The shore to which their shiver�d sail shall never stretch again.	
 
RHYME a a b b

Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down;	
It cannot feel for others� woes, it dare not dream its own;	        
That heavy chill has frozen o�er the fountain of our tears,	
And though the eye may sparkle still, �tis where the ice appears.	
 
RHYME a a b b

Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,	
Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest;	
�Tis but as ivy-leaves around the ruin�d turret wreathe,	        
All green and wildly fresh without, but worn and gray beneath.	
 
RHYME a a b b

O could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been,	
Or weep as I could once have wept o�er many a vanish�d scene,�	
As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,	
So midst the wither�d waste of life, those tears would flow to me!

AUTHOR G K Chesterton

TITLE Ballad of the White Horse

RHYME a b c c b

Of great limbs gone to chaos,
A great face turned to night--
Why bend above a shapeless shroud
Seeking in such archaic cloud
Sight of strong lords and light?

RHYME a b c c b

Where seven sunken Englands
Lie buried one by one,
Why should one idle spade, I wonder,
Shake up the dust of thanes like thunder
To smoke and choke the sun?

RHYME a b c c c b

In cloud of clay so cast to heaven
What shape shall man discern?
These lords may light the mystery
Of mastery or victory,
And these ride high in history,
But these shall not return.

RHYME a b c c c b

Gored on the Norman gonfalon
The Golden Dragon died:
We shall not wake with ballad strings
The good time of the smaller things,
We shall not see the holy kings
Ride down by Severn side.

RHYME a b c c c b

Stiff, strange, and quaintly coloured
As the broidery of Bayeux
The England of that dawn remains,
And this of Alfred and the Danes
Seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns
Too English to be true.

RHYME a b c c c b

Of a good king on an island
That ruled once on a time;
And as he walked by an apple tree
There came green devils out of the sea
With sea-plants trailing heavily
And tracks of opal slime.

RHYME a b c c c b

Yet Alfred is no fairy tale;
His days as our days ran,
He also looked forth for an hour
On peopled plains and skies that lower,
From those few windows in the tower
That is the head of a man.

RHYME a b c c c b

But who shall look from Alfred's hood
Or breathe his breath alive?
His century like a small dark cloud
Drifts far; it is an eyeless crowd,
Where the tortured trumpets scream aloud
And the dense arrows drive.

RHYME a b c c c b

Lady, by one light only
We look from Alfred's eyes,
We know he saw athwart the wreck
The sign that hangs about your neck,
Where One more than Melchizedek
Is dead and never dies.

RHYME a b c c c b

Therefore I bring these rhymes to you
Who brought the cross to me,
Since on you flaming without flaw
I saw the sign that Guthrum saw
When he let break his ships of awe,
And laid peace on the sea.

RHYME a b c c c b

Do you remember when we went
Under a dragon moon,
And `mid volcanic tints of night
Walked where they fought the unknown fight
And saw black trees on the battle-height,
Black thorn on Ethandune?

RHYME a b c c c b

And I thought, "I will go with you,
As man with God has gone,
And wander with a wandering star,
The wandering heart of things that are,
The fiery cross of love and war
That like yourself, goes on."

RHYME a b c c c b

O go you onward; where you are
Shall honour and laughter be,
Past purpled forest and pearled foam,
God's winged pavilion free to roam,
Your face, that is a wandering home,
A flying home for me.

RHYME a b c c c b

Ride through the silent earthquake lands,
Wide as a waste is wide,
Across these days like deserts, when
Pride and a little scratching pen
Have dried and split the hearts of men,
Heart of the heroes, ride.

RHYME a b c c c b

Up through an empty house of stars,
Being what heart you are,
Up the inhuman steeps of space
As on a staircase go in grace,
Carrying the firelight on your face
Beyond the loneliest star.

RHYME a b c c c b

Take these; in memory of the hour
We strayed a space from home
And saw the smoke-hued hamlets, quaint
With Westland king and Westland saint,
And watched the western glory faint
Along the road to Frome.

RHYME a b c b

Before the gods that made the gods
Had seen their sunrise pass,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
Was cut out of the grass.

RHYME a b c b

Before the gods that made the gods
Had drunk at dawn their fill,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale
Was hoary on the hill.

RHYME a b c b

Age beyond age on British land,
Aeons on aeons gone,
Was peace and war in western hills,
And the White Horse looked on.

RHYME a b c c b

For the White Horse knew England
When there was none to know;
He saw the first oar break or bend,
He saw heaven fall and the world end,
O God, how long ago.

RHYME a b c c b

For the end of the world was long ago,
And all we dwell to-day
As children of some second birth,
Like a strange people left on earth
After a judgment day.

RHYME a b c b

For the end of the world was long ago,
When the ends of the world waxed free,
When Rome was sunk in a waste of slaves,
And the sun drowned in the sea.

RHYME a b c b

When Caesar's sun fell out of the sky
And whoso hearkened right
Could only hear the plunging
Of the nations in the night.

RHYME a b c c b

When the ends of the earth came marching in
To torch and cresset gleam.
And the roads of the world that lead to Rome
Were filled with faces that moved like foam,
Like faces in a dream.

RHYME a b c c b

And men rode out of the eastern lands,
Broad river and burning plain;
Trees that are Titan flowers to see,
And tiger skies, striped horribly,
With tints of tropic rain.

RHYME a b c c b

Where Ind's enamelled peaks arise
Around that inmost one,
Where ancient eagles on its brink,
Vast as archangels, gather and drink
The sacrament of the sun.

RHYME a b c c b

And men brake out of the northern lands,
Enormous lands alone,
Where a spell is laid upon life and lust
And the rain is changed to a silver dust
And the sea to a great green stone.

RHYME a b c c b

And a Shape that moveth murkily
In mirrors of ice and night,
Hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds,
As death and a shock of evil words
Blast a man's hair with white.

RHYME a b c c b

And the cry of the palms and the purple moons,
Or the cry of the frost and foam,
Swept ever around an inmost place,
And the din of distant race on race
Cried and replied round Rome.

RHYME a b c b

And there was death on the Emperor
And night upon the Pope:
And Alfred, hiding in deep grass,
Hardened his heart with hope.

RHYME a b c c b

A sea-folk blinder than the sea
Broke all about his land,
But Alfred up against them bare
And gripped the ground and grasped the air,
Staggered, and strove to stand.

RHYME a b c c b

He bent them back with spear and spade,
With desperate dyke and wall,
With foemen leaning on his shield
And roaring on him when he reeled;
And no help came at all.

RHYME a b c c c b

He broke them with a broken sword
A little towards the sea,
And for one hour of panting peace,
Ringed with a roar that would not cease,
With golden crown and girded fleece
Made laws under a tree.

RHYME a b c c b

The Northmen came about our land
A Christless chivalry:
Who knew not of the arch or pen,
Great, beautiful half-witted men
From the sunrise and the sea.

RHYME a b c c b

Misshapen ships stood on the deep
Full of strange gold and fire,
And hairy men, as huge as sin
With horned heads, came wading in
Through the long, low sea-mire.

RHYME a b c c b

Our towns were shaken of tall kings
With scarlet beards like blood:
The world turned empty where they trod,
They took the kindly cross of God
And cut it up for wood.

RHYME a b c b

Their souls were drifting as the sea,
And all good towns and lands
They only saw with heavy eyes,
And broke with heavy hands,

RHYME a b c b

Their gods were sadder than the sea,
Gods of a wandering will,
Who cried for blood like beasts at night,
Sadly, from hill to hill.

RHYME a b c b

They seemed as trees walking the earth,
As witless and as tall,
Yet they took hold upon the heavens
And no help came at all.

RHYME a b c b

They bred like birds in English woods,
They rooted like the rose,
When Alfred came to Athelney
To hide him from their bows

RHYME a b c b

There was not English armour left,
Nor any English thing,
When Alfred came to Athelney
To be an English king.

RHYME a b c c b

For earthquake swallowing earthquake
Uprent the Wessex tree;
The whirlpool of the pagan sway
Had swirled his sires as sticks away
When a flood smites the sea.

RHYME a b c c c b

And the great kings of Wessex
Wearied and sank in gore,
And even their ghosts in that great stress
Grew greyer and greyer, less and less,
With the lords that died in Lyonesse
And the king that comes no more.

RHYME a b c b

And the God of the Golden Dragon
Was dumb upon his throne,
And the lord of the Golden Dragon
Ran in the woods alone.

RHYME a b c c b

And if ever he climbed the crest of luck
And set the flag before,
Returning as a wheel returns,
Came ruin and the rain that burns,
And all began once more.

RHYME a b c b

And naught was left King Alfred
But shameful tears of rage,
In the island in the river
In the end of all his age.

RHYME a b c c c b

In the island in the river
He was broken to his knee:
And he read, writ with an iron pen,
That God had wearied of Wessex men
And given their country, field and fen,
To the devils of the sea.

RHYME a b c c c b

And he saw in a little picture,
Tiny and far away,
His mother sitting in Egbert's hall,
And a book she showed him, very small,
Where a sapphire Mary sat in stall
With a golden Christ at play.

RHYME a b c b

It was wrought in the monk's slow manner,
From silver and sanguine shell,
Where the scenes are little and terrible,
Keyholes of heaven and hell.

RHYME a b c c c b

In the river island of Athelney,
With the river running past,
In colours of such simple creed
All things sprang at him, sun and weed,
Till the grass grew to be grass indeed
And the tree was a tree at last.

RHYME a b c c c b

Fearfully plain the flowers grew,
Like the child's book to read,
Or like a friend's face seen in a glass;
He looked; and there Our Lady was,
She stood and stroked the tall live grass
As a man strokes his steed.

RHYME a b c b

Her face was like an open word
When brave men speak and choose,
The very colours of her coat
Were better than good news.

RHYME a b c c b

She spoke not, nor turned not,
Nor any sign she cast,
Only she stood up straight and free,
Between the flowers in Athelney,
And the river running past.

RHYME a b c c c b

One dim ancestral jewel hung
On his ruined armour grey,
He rent and cast it at her feet:
Where, after centuries, with slow feet,
Men came from hall and school and street
And found it where it lay.

RHYME a b c b

"Mother of God," the wanderer said,
"I am but a common king,
Nor will I ask what saints may ask,
To see a secret thing.

RHYME a b c c b

"The gates of heaven are fearful gates
Worse than the gates of hell;
Not I would break the splendours barred
Or seek to know the thing they guard,
Which is too good to tell.

RHYME a b c c b

"But for this earth most pitiful,
This little land I know,
If that which is for ever is,
Or if our hearts shall break with bliss,
Seeing the stranger go?

RHYME a b c c c b

"When our last bow is broken, Queen,
And our last javelin cast,
Under some sad, green evening sky,
Holding a ruined cross on high,
Under warm westland grass to lie,
Shall we come home at last?"

RHYME a b c c c b

And a voice came human but high up,
Like a cottage climbed among
The clouds; or a serf of hut and croft
That sits by his hovel fire as oft,
But hears on his old bare roof aloft
A belfry burst in song.

RHYME a b c c b

"The gates of heaven are lightly locked,
We do not guard our gain,
The heaviest hind may easily
Come silently and suddenly
Upon me in a lane.

RHYME a b c c b

"And any little maid that walks
In good thoughts apart,
May break the guard of the Three Kings
And see the dear and dreadful things
I hid within my heart.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The meanest man in grey fields gone
Behind the set of sun,
Heareth between star and other star,
Through the door of the darkness fallen ajar,
The council, eldest of things that are,
The talk of the Three in One.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The gates of heaven are lightly locked,
We do not guard our gold,
Men may uproot where worlds begin,
Or read the name of the nameless sin;
But if he fail or if he win
To no good man is told.

RHYME a b c b

"The men of the East may spell the stars,
And times and triumphs mark,
But the men signed of the cross of Christ
Go gaily in the dark.

RHYME a b c b

"The men of the East may search the scrolls
For sure fates and fame,
But the men that drink the blood of God
Go singing to their shame.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The wise men know what wicked things
Are written on the sky,
They trim sad lamps, they touch sad strings,
Hearing the heavy purple wings,
Where the forgotten seraph kings
Still plot how God shall die.

RHYME a b c c b

"The wise men know all evil things
Under the twisted trees,
Where the perverse in pleasure pine
And men are weary of green wine
And sick of crimson seas.

RHYME a b c b

"But you and all the kind of Christ
Are ignorant and brave,
And you have wars you hardly win
And souls you hardly save.

RHYME a b c b

"I tell you naught for your comfort,
Yea, naught for your desire,
Save that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.

RHYME a b c b

"Night shall be thrice night over you,
And heaven an iron cope.
Do you have joy without a cause,
Yea, faith without a hope?"

RHYME a b c c c b

Even as she spoke she was not,
Nor any word said he,
He only heard, still as he stood
Under the old night's nodding hood,
The sea-folk breaking down the wood
Like a high tide from sea.

RHYME a b c c b

He only heard the heathen men,
Whose eyes are blue and bleak,
Singing about some cruel thing
Done by a great and smiling king
In daylight on a deck.

RHYME a b c c b

He only heard the heathen men,
Whose eyes are blue and blind,
Singing what shameful things are done
Between the sunlit sea and the sun
When the land is left behind.

RHYME a b c b

Up across windy wastes and up
Went Alfred over the shaws,
Shaken of the joy of giants,
The joy without a cause.

RHYME a b c b

In the slopes away to the western bays,
Where blows not ever a tree,
He washed his soul in the west wind
And his body in the sea.

RHYME a b c b

And he set to rhyme his ale-measures,
And he sang aloud his laws,
Because of the joy of the giants,
The joy without a cause.

RHYME a b c c c b

The King went gathering Wessex men,
As grain out of the chaff
The few that were alive to die,
Laughing, as littered skulls that lie
After lost battles turn to the sky
An everlasting laugh.

RHYME a b c c c b

The King went gathering Christian men,
As wheat out of the husk;
Eldred, the Franklin by the sea,
And Mark, the man from Italy,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree,
From the old tribe on Usk.

RHYME a b c c b

The rook croaked homeward heavily,
The west was clear and warm,
The smoke of evening food and ease
Rose like a blue tree in the trees
When he came to Eldred's farm.

RHYME a b c c c b

But Eldred's farm was fallen awry,
Like an old cripple's bones,
And Eldred's tools were red with rust,
And on his well was a green crust,
And purple thistles upward thrust,
Between the kitchen stones.

RHYME a b c c c b

But smoke of some good feasting
Went upwards evermore,
And Eldred's doors stood wide apart
For loitering foot or labouring cart,
And Eldred's great and foolish heart
Stood open like his door.

RHYME a b c b

A mighty man was Eldred,
A bulk for casks to fill,
His face a dreaming furnace,
His body a walking hill.

RHYME a b c c c b

In the old wars of Wessex
His sword had sunken deep,
But all his friends, he signed and said,
Were broken about Ethelred;
And between the deep drink and the dead
He had fallen upon sleep.

RHYME a b c c b

"Come not to me, King Alfred, Save always for the ale:
Why should my harmless hinds be slain
Because the chiefs cry once again,
As in all fights, that we shall gain,
And in all fights we fail?

RHYME a b c c b

"Your scalds still thunder and prophesy
That crown that never comes;
Friend, I will watch the certain things,
Swine, and slow moons like silver rings,
And the ripening of the plums."

RHYME a b c c b

And Alfred answered, drinking,
And gravely, without blame,
"Nor bear I boast of scald or king,
The thing I bear is a lesser thing,
But comes in a better name.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Out of the mouth of the Mother of God,
More than the doors of doom,
I call the muster of Wessex men
From grassy hamlet or ditch or den,
To break and be broken, God knows when,
But I have seen for whom.

RHYME a b c c c b

Out of the mouth of the Mother of God
Like a little word come I;
For I go gathering Christian men
From sunken paving and ford and fen,
To die in a battle, God knows when,
By God, but I know why.

RHYME a b c c b

"And this is the word of Mary,
The word of the world's desire
`No more of comfort shall ye get,
Save that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher.' "

RHYME a b c c c b

Then silence sank. And slowly
Arose the sea-land lord,
Like some vast beast for mystery,
He filled the room and porch and sky,
And from a cobwebbed nail on high
Unhooked his heavy sword.

RHYME a b c c c b

Up on the shrill sea-downs and up
Went Alfred all alone,
Turning but once e'er the door was shut,
Shouting to Eldred over his butt,
That he bring all spears to the woodman's hut
Hewn under Egbert's Stone.

RHYME a b c c c b

And he turned his back and broke the fern,
And fought the moths of dusk,
And went on his way for other friends
Friends fallen of all the wide world's ends,
From Rome that wrath and pardon sends
And the grey tribes on Usk.

RHYME a b c c b

He saw gigantic tracks of death
And many a shape of doom,
Good steadings to grey ashes gone
And a monk's house white like a skeleton
In the green crypt of the combe.

RHYME a b c c b

And in many a Roman villa
Earth and her ivies eat,
Saw coloured pavements sink and fade
In flowers, and the windy colonnade
Like the spectre of a street.

RHYME a b c b

But the cold stars clustered
Among the cold pines
Ere he was half on his pilgrimage
Over the western lines.

RHYME a b c b

And the white dawn widened
Ere he came to the last pine,
Where Mark, the man from Italy,
Still made the Christian sign.

RHYME a b c b

The long farm lay on the large hill-side,
Flat like a painted plan,
And by the side the low white house,
Where dwelt the southland man.

RHYME a b c c c b

A bronzed man, with a bird's bright eye,
And a strong bird's beak and brow,
His skin was brown like buried gold,
And of certain of his sires was told
That they came in the shining ship of old,
With Caesar in the prow.

RHYME a b c c b

His fruit trees stood like soldiers
Drilled in a straight line,
His strange, stiff olives did not fail,
And all the kings of the earth drank ale,
But he drank wine.

RHYME a b c c c b

Wide over wasted British plains
Stood never an arch or dome,
Only the trees to toss and reel,
The tribes to bicker, the beasts to squeal;
But the eyes in his head were strong like steel,
And his soul remembered Rome.

RHYME a b c c b

Then Alfred of the lonely spear
Lifted his lion head;
And fronted with the Italian's eye,
Asking him of his whence and why,
King Alfred stood and said:

RHYME a b c c c b

"I am that oft-defeated King
Whose failure fills the land,
Who fled before the Danes of old,
Who chaffered with the Danes with gold,
Who now upon the Wessex wold
Hardly has feet to stand.

RHYME a b c b

"But out of the mouth of the Mother of God
I have seen the truth like fire,
This--that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher."

RHYME a b c c c b

Long looked the Roman on the land;
The trees as golden crowns
Blazed, drenched with dawn and dew-empearled
While faintlier coloured, freshlier curled,
The clouds from underneath the world
Stood up over the downs.

RHYME a b c c c b

"These vines be ropes that drag me hard,"
He said. "I go not far;
Where would you meet? For you must hold
Half Wiltshire and the White Horse wold,
And the Thames bank to Owsenfold,
If Wessex goes to war.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Guthrum sits strong on either bank
And you must press his lines
Inwards, and eastward drive him down;
I doubt if you shall take the crown
Till you have taken London town.
For me, I have the vines."

RHYME a b c c c b

"If each man on the Judgment Day
Meet God on a plain alone,"
Said Alfred, "I will speak for you
As for myself, and call it true
That you brought all fighting folk you knew
Lined under Egbert's Stone.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Though I be in the dust ere then,
I know where you will be."
And shouldering suddenly his spear
He faded like some elfin fear,
Where the tall pines ran up, tier on tier
Tree overtoppling tree.

RHYME a b c c c b

He shouldered his spear at morning
And laughed to lay it on,
But he leaned on his spear as on a staff,
With might and little mood to laugh,
Or ever he sighted chick or calf
Of Colan of Caerleon.

RHYME a b c c b

For the man dwelt in a lost land
Of boulders and broken men,
In a great grey cave far off to the south
Where a thick green forest stopped the mouth,
Giving darkness in his den.

RHYME a b c c b

And the man was come like a shadow,
From the shadow of Druid trees,
Where Usk, with mighty murmurings,
Past Caerleon of the fallen kings,
Goes out to ghostly seas.

RHYME a b c b

Last of a race in ruin--
He spoke the speech of the Gaels;
His kin were in holy Ireland,
Or up in the crags of Wales.

RHYME a b c c b

But his soul stood with his mother's folk,
That were of the rain-wrapped isle,
Where Patrick and Brandan westerly
Looked out at last on a landless sea
And the sun's last smile.

RHYME a b c b

His harp was carved and cunning,
As the Celtic craftsman makes,
Graven all over with twisting shapes
Like many headless snakes.

RHYME a b c b

His harp was carved and cunning,
His sword prompt and sharp,
And he was gay when he held the sword,
Sad when he held the harp.

RHYME a b c b

For the great Gaels of Ireland
Are the men that God made mad,
For all their wars are merry,
And all their songs are sad.

RHYME a b c c b

He kept the Roman order,
He made the Christian sign;
But his eyes grew often blind and bright,
And the sea that rose in the rocks at night
Rose to his head like wine.

RHYME a b c b

He made the sign of the cross of God,
He knew the Roman prayer,
But he had unreason in his heart
Because of the gods that were.

RHYME a b c b

Even they that walked on the high cliffs,
High as the clouds were then,
Gods of unbearable beauty,
That broke the hearts of men.

RHYME a b c c b

And whether in seat or saddle,
Whether with frown or smile,
Whether at feast or fight was he,
He heard the noise of a nameless sea
On an undiscovered isle.

RHYME a b c b

Lifting the great green ivy
And the great spear lowering,
One said, "I am Alfred of Wessex,
And I am a conquered king."

RHYME a b c b

And the man of the cave made answer,
And his eyes were stars of scorn,
"And better kings were conquered
Or ever your sires were born.

RHYME a b c b

"What goddess was your mother,
What fay your breed begot,
That you should not die with Uther
And Arthur and Lancelot?

RHYME a b c b

"But when you win you brag and blow,
And when you lose you rail,
Army of eastland yokels
Not strong enough to fail."

RHYME a b c c b

"I bring not boast or railing,"
Spake Alfred not in ire,
"I bring of Our Lady a lesson set,
This--that the sky grows darker yet
And the sea rises higher."

RHYME a b c c b

Then Colan of the Sacred Tree
Tossed his black mane on high,
And cried, as rigidly he rose,
"And if the sea and sky be foes,
We will tame the sea and sky."

RHYME a b c b

Smiled Alfred, "Seek ye a fable
More dizzy and more dread
Than all your mad barbarian tales
Where the sky stands on its head ?

RHYME a b c b

"A tale where a man looks down on the sky
That has long looked down on him;
A tale where a man can swallow a sea
That might swallow the seraphim.

RHYME a b c c b

"Bring to the hut by Egbert's Stone
All bills and bows ye have."
And Alfred strode off rapidly,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree
Went slowly to his cave.

RHYME a b c c b

In a tree that yawned and twisted
The King's few goods were flung,
A mass-book mildewed, line by line,
And weapons and a skin of wine,
And an old harp unstrung.

RHYME a b c c b

By the yawning tree in the twilight
The King unbound his sword,
Severed the harp of all his goods,
And there in the cool and soundless woods
Sounded a single chord.

RHYME a b c b

Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,
The sullen flies in swarm,
And went unarmed over the hills,
With the harp upon his arm,

RHYME a b c c b

Until he came to the White Horse Vale
And saw across the plains,
In the twilight high and far and fell,
Like the fiery terraces of hell,
The camp fires of the Danes--

RHYME a b c c c b

The fires of the Great Army
That was made of iron men,
Whose lights of sacrilege and scorn
Ran around England red as morn,
Fires over Glastonbury Thorn--
Fires out on Ely Fen.

RHYME a b c c c b

And as he went by White Horse Vale
He saw lie wan and wide
The old horse graven, God knows when,
By gods or beasts or what things then
Walked a new world instead of men
And scrawled on the hill-side.

RHYME a b c c c b

And when he came to White Horse Down
The great White Horse was grey,
For it was ill scoured of the weed,
And lichen and thorn could crawl and feed,
Since the foes of settled house and creed
Had swept old works away.

RHYME a b c d d d c

King Alfred gazed all sorrowful
At thistle and mosses grey,
Then laughed; and watched the finches flash,
Till a rally of Danes with shield and bill
Rolled drunk over the dome of the hill,
And, hearing of his harp and skill,
They dragged him to their play.

RHYME a b c b

And as they went through the high green grass
They roared like the great green sea;
But when they came to the red camp fire
They were silent suddenly.

RHYME a b c b

And as they went up the wastes away
They went reeling to and fro;
But when they came to the red camp fire
They stood all in a row.

RHYME a b c c b

For golden in the firelight,
With a smile carved on his lips,
And a beard curled right cunningly,
Was Guthrum of the Northern Sea,
The emperor of the ships--

RHYME a b c c c b

With three great earls King Guthrum
Went the rounds from fire to fire,
With Harold, nephew of the King,
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling,
And Elf, whose gold lute had a string
That sighed like all desire.

RHYME a b c c c b

The Earls of the Great Army
That no men born could tire,
Whose flames anear him or aloof
Took hold of towers or walls of proof,
Fire over Glastonbury roof
And out on Ely, fire.

RHYME a b c c c b

And Guthrum heard the soldiers' tale
And bade the stranger play;
Not harshly, but as one on high,
On a marble pillar in the sky,
Who sees all folk that live and die--
Pigmy and far away.

RHYME a b c c c b

And Alfred, King of Wessex,
Looked on his conqueror--
And his hands hardened; but he played,
And leaving all later hates unsaid,
He sang of some old British raid
On the wild west march of yore.

RHYME a b c c b

He sang of war in the warm wet shires,
Where rain nor fruitage fails,
Where England of the motley states
Deepens like a garden to the gates
In the purple walls of Wales.

RHYME a b c c b

He sang of the seas of savage heads
And the seas and seas of spears,
Boiling all over Offa's Dyke,
What time a Wessex club could strike
The kings of the mountaineers.

RHYME a b c c b

Till Harold laughed and snatched the harp,
The kinsman of the King,
A big youth, beardless like a child,
Whom the new wine of war sent wild,
Smote, and began to sing--

RHYME a b c b

And he cried of the ships as eagles
That circle fiercely and fly,
And sweep the seas and strike the towns
From Cyprus round to Skye.

RHYME a b c b

How swiftly and with peril
They gather all good things,
The high horns of the forest beasts,
Or the secret stones of kings.

RHYME a b c b

"For Rome was given to rule the world,
And gat of it little joy--
But we, but we shall enjoy the world,
The whole huge world a toy.

RHYME a b c b

"Great wine like blood from Burgundy,
Cloaks like the clouds from Tyre,
And marble like solid moonlight,
And gold like frozen fire.

RHYME a b c b

"Smells that a man might swill in a cup,
Stones that a man might eat,
And the great smooth women like ivory
That the Turks sell in the street."

RHYME a b c b

He sang the song of the thief of the world,
And the gods that love the thief;
And he yelled aloud at the cloister-yards,
Where men go gathering grief.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Well have you sung, O stranger,
Of death on the dyke in Wales,
Your chief was a bracelet-giver;
But the red unbroken river
Of a race runs not for ever,
But suddenly it fails.

RHYME a b c b

"Doubtless your sires were sword-swingers
When they waded fresh from foam,
Before they were turned to women
By the god of the nails from Rome;

RHYME a b c b

"But since you bent to the shaven men,
Who neither lust nor smite,
Thunder of Thor, we hunt you
A hare on the mountain height."

RHYME a b c c c b

King Guthrum smiled a little,
And said, "It is enough,
Nephew, let Elf retune the string;
A boy must needs like bellowing,
But the old ears of a careful king
Are glad of songs less rough."

RHYME a b c b

Blue-eyed was Elf the minstrel,
With womanish hair and ring,
Yet heavy was his hand on sword,
Though light upon the string.

RHYME a b c b

And as he stirred the strings of the harp
To notes but four or five,
The heart of each man moved in him
Like a babe buried alive.

RHYME a b c b

And they felt the land of the folk-songs
Spread southward of the Dane,
And they heard the good Rhine flowing
In the heart of all Allemagne.

RHYME a b c b

They felt the land of the folk-songs,
Where the gifts hang on the tree,
Where the girls give ale at morning
And the tears come easily.

RHYME a b c b

The mighty people, womanlike,
That have pleasure in their pain
As he sang of Balder beautiful,
Whom the heavens loved in vain.

RHYME a b c b

As he sang of Balder beautiful,
Whom the heavens could not save,
Till the world was like a sea of tears
And every soul a wave.

RHYME a b c c c b

"There is always a thing forgotten
When all the world goes well;
A thing forgotten, as long ago,
When the gods forgot the mistletoe,
And soundless as an arrow of snow
The arrow of anguish fell.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The thing on the blind side of the heart,
On the wrong side of the door,
The green plant groweth, menacing
Almighty lovers in the spring;
There is always a forgotten thing,
And love is not secure."

RHYME a b c b

And all that sat by the fire were sad,
Save Ogier, who was stern,
And his eyes hardened, even to stones,
As he took the harp in turn;

RHYME a b c c c b

Earl Ogier of the Stone and Sling
Was odd to ear and sight,
Old he was, but his locks were red,
And jests were all the words he said
Yet he was sad at board and bed
And savage in the fight.

RHYME a b c c b

"You sing of the young gods easily
In the days when you are young;
But I go smelling yew and sods,
And I know there are gods behind the gods,
Gods that are best unsung.

RHYME a b c b

"And a man grows ugly for women,
And a man grows dull with ale,
Well if he find in his soul at last
Fury, that does not fail.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The wrath of the gods behind the gods
Who would rend all gods and men,
Well if the old man's heart hath still
Wheels sped of rage and roaring will,
Like cataracts to break down and kill,
Well for the old man then--

RHYME a b c b

"While there is one tall shrine to shake,
Or one live man to rend;
For the wrath of the gods behind the gods
Who are weary to make an end.

RHYME a b c c b

"There lives one moment for a man
When the door at his shoulder shakes,
When the taut rope parts under the pull,
And the barest branch is beautiful
One moment, while it breaks.

RHYME a b c c c b

"So rides my soul upon the sea
That drinks the howling ships,
Though in black jest it bows and nods
Under the moons with silver rods,
I know it is roaring at the gods,
Waiting the last eclipse.

RHYME a b c c b

"And in the last eclipse the sea
Shall stand up like a tower,
Above all moons made dark and riven,
Hold up its foaming head in heaven,
And laugh, knowing its hour.

RHYME a b c c c b

"And the high ones in the happy town
Propped of the planets seven,
Shall know a new light in the mind,
A noise about them and behind,
Shall hear an awful voice, and find
Foam in the courts of heaven.

RHYME a b c b

"And you that sit by the fire are young,
And true love waits for you;
But the king and I grow old, grow old,
And hate alone is true."

RHYME a b c b

And Guthrum shook his head but smiled,
For he was a mighty clerk,
And had read lines in the Latin books
When all the north was dark.

RHYME a b c b

He said, "I am older than you, Ogier;
Not all things would I rend,
For whether life be bad or good
It is best to abide the end."

RHYME a b c b

He took the great harp wearily,
Even Guthrum of the Danes,
With wide eyes bright as the one long day
On the long polar plains.

RHYME a b c b

For he sang of a wheel returning,
And the mire trod back to mire,
And how red hells and golden heavens
Are castles in the fire.

RHYME a b c c b

"It is good to sit where the good tales go,
To sit as our fathers sat;
But the hour shall come after his youth,
When a man shall know not tales but truth,
And his heart fail thereat.

RHYME a b c b

"When he shall read what is written
So plain in clouds and clods,
When he shall hunger without hope
Even for evil gods.

RHYME a b c c b

"For this is a heavy matter,
And the truth is cold to tell;
Do we not know, have we not heard,
The soul is like a lost bird,
The body a broken shell.

RHYME a b c c b

"And a man hopes, being ignorant,
Till in white woods apart
He finds at last the lost bird dead:
And a man may still lift up his head
But never more his heart.

RHYME a b c b

"There comes no noise but weeping
Out of the ancient sky,
And a tear is in the tiniest flower
Because the gods must die.

RHYME a b c b

"The little brooks are very sweet,
Like a girl's ribbons curled,
But the great sea is bitter
That washes all the world.

RHYME a b c b

"Strong are the Roman roses,
Or the free flowers of the heath,
But every flower, like a flower of the sea,
Smelleth with the salt of death.

RHYME a b c c c b

"And the heart of the locked battle
Is the happiest place for men;
When shrieking souls as shafts go by
And many have died and all may die;
Though this word be a mystery,
Death is most distant then.

RHYME a b c b

"Death blazes bright above the cup,
And clear above the crown;
But in that dream of battle
We seem to tread it down.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Wherefore I am a great king,
And waste the world in vain,
Because man hath not other power,
Save that in dealing death for dower,
He may forget it for an hour
To remember it again."

RHYME a b c c b

And slowly his hands and thoughtfully
Fell from the lifted lyre,
And the owls moaned from the mighty trees
Till Alfred caught it to his knees
And smote it as in ire.

RHYME a b c b

He heaved the head of the harp on high
And swept the framework barred,
And his stroke had all the rattle and spark
Of horses flying hard.

RHYME a b c b

"When God put man in a garden
He girt him with a sword,
And sent him forth a free knight
That might betray his lord;

RHYME a b c b

"He brake Him and betrayed Him,
And fast and far he fell,
Till you and I may stretch our necks
And burn our beards in hell.

RHYME a b c b

"But though I lie on the floor of the world,
With the seven sins for rods,
I would rather fall with Adam
Than rise with all your gods.

RHYME a b c b

"What have the strong gods given?
Where have the glad gods led?
When Guthrum sits on a hero's throne
And asks if he is dead?

RHYME a b c b

"Sirs, I am but a nameless man,
A rhymester without home,
Yet since I come of the Wessex clay
And carry the cross of Rome,

RHYME a b c c c b

"I will even answer the mighty earl
That asked of Wessex men
Why they be meek and monkish folk,
And bow to the White Lord's broken yoke;
What sign have we save blood and smoke?
Here is my answer then.

RHYME a b c c c b

"That on you is fallen the shadow,
And not upon the Name;
That though we scatter and though we fly,
And you hang over us like the sky,
You are more tired of victory,
Than we are tired of shame.

RHYME a b c b

"That though you hunt the Christian man
Like a hare on the hill-side,
The hare has still more heart to run
Than you have heart to ride.

RHYME a b c b

"That though all lances split on you,
All swords be heaved in vain,
We have more lust again to lose
Than you to win again.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Your lord sits high in the saddle,
A broken-hearted king,
But our king Alfred, lost from fame,
Fallen among foes or bonds of shame,
In I know not what mean trade or name,
Has still some song to sing;

RHYME a b c b

"Our monks go robed in rain and snow,
But the heart of flame therein,
But you go clothed in feasts and flames,
When all is ice within;

RHYME a b c b

"Nor shall all iron dooms make dumb
Men wondering ceaselessly,
If it be not better to fast for joy
Than feast for misery.

RHYME a b c c b

"Nor monkish order only
Slides down, as field to fen,
All things achieved and chosen pass,
As the White Horse fades in the grass,
No work of Christian men.

RHYME a b c c b

"Ere the sad gods that made your gods
Saw their sad sunrise pass,
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale,
That you have left to darken and fail,
Was cut out of the grass.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Therefore your end is on you,
Is on you and your kings,
Not for a fire in Ely fen,
Not that your gods are nine or ten,
But because it is only Christian men
Guard even heathen things.

RHYME a b c c c b

"For our God hath blessed creation,
Calling it good. I know
What spirit with whom you blindly band
Hath blessed destruction with his hand;
Yet by God's death the stars shall stand
And the small apples grow."

RHYME a b c b

And the King, with harp on shoulder,
Stood up and ceased his song;
And the owls moaned from the mighty trees,
And the Danes laughed loud and long.

RHYME a b c c c b

Thick thunder of the snorting swine,
Enormous in the gloam,
Rending among all roots that cling,
And the wild horses whinnying,
Were the night's noises when the King
Shouldering his harp, went home.

RHYME a b c c c b

With eyes of owl and feet of fox,
Full of all thoughts he went;
He marked the tilt of the pagan camp,
The paling of pine, the sentries' tramp,
And the one great stolen altar-lamp
Over Guthrum in his tent.

RHYME a b c c c b

By scrub and thorn in Ethandune
That night the foe had lain;
Whence ran across the heather grey
The old stones of a Roman way;
And in a wood not far away
The pale road split in twain.

RHYME a b c c c b

He marked the wood and the cloven ways
With an old captain's eyes,
And he thought how many a time had he
Sought to see Doom he could not see;
How ruin had come and victory,
And both were a surprise.

RHYME a b c c c b

Even so he had watched and wondered
Under Ashdown from the plains;
With Ethelred praying in his tent,
Till the white hawthorn swung and bent,
As Alfred rushed his spears and rent
The shield-wall of the Danes.

RHYME a b c c c b

Even so he had watched and wondered,
Knowing neither less nor more,
Till all his lords lay dying,
And axes on axes plying,
Flung him, and drove him flying
Like a pirate to the shore.

RHYME a b c b

Wise he had been before defeat,
And wise before success;
Wise in both hours and ignorant,
Knowing neither more nor less.

RHYME a b c c c b

As he went down to the river-hut
He knew a night-shade scent,
Owls did as evil cherubs rise,
With little wings and lantern eyes,
As though he sank through the under-skies;
But down and down he went.

RHYME a b c c c b

As he went down to the river-hut
He went as one that fell;
Seeing the high forest domes and spars.
Dim green or torn with golden scars,
As the proud look up at the evil stars,
In the red heavens of hell.

RHYME a b c c c b

For he must meet by the river-hut
Them he had bidden to arm,
Mark from the towers of Italy,
And Colan of the Sacred Tree,
And Eldred who beside the sea
Held heavily his farm.

RHYME a b c c c b

The roof leaned gaping to the grass,
As a monstrous mushroom lies;
Echoing and empty seemed the place;
But opened in a little space
A great grey woman with scarred face
And strong and humbled eyes.

RHYME a b c c b

King Alfred was but a meagre man,
Bright eyed, but lean and pale:
And swordless, with his harp and rags,
He seemed a beggar, such as lags
Looking for crusts and ale.

RHYME a b c c b

And the woman, with a woman's eyes
Of pity at once and ire,
Said, when that she had glared a span,
"There is a cake for any man
If he will watch the fire."

RHYME a b c b

And Alfred, bowing heavily,
Sat down the fire to stir,
And even as the woman pitied him
So did he pity her.

RHYME a b c c c b

Saying, "O great heart in the night,
O best cast forth for worst,
Twilight shall melt and morning stir,
And no kind thing shall come to her,
Till God shall turn the world over
And all the last are first.

RHYME a b c b

"And well may God with the serving-folk
Cast in His dreadful lot;
Is not He too a servant,
And is not He forgot ?

RHYME a b c b

"For was not God my gardener
And silent like a slave;
That opened oaks on the uplands
Or thicket in graveyard gave?

RHYME a b c b

"And was not God my armourer,
All patient and unpaid,
That sealed my skull as a helmet,
And ribs for hauberk made?

RHYME a b c c c b

"Did not a great grey servant
Of all my sires and me,
Build this pavilion of the pines,
And herd the fowls and fill the vines,
And labour and pass and leave no signs
Save mercy and mystery?

RHYME a b c c c b

"For God is a great servant,
And rose before the day,
From some primordial slumber torn;
But all we living later born
Sleep on, and rise after the morn,
And the Lord has gone away.

RHYME a b c c c b

"On things half sprung from sleeping,
All sleepy suns have shone,
They stretch stiff arms, the yawning trees,
The beasts blink upon hands and knees,
Man is awake and does and sees--
But Heaven has done and gone.

RHYME a b c c b

For who shall guess the good riddle
Or speak of the Holiest,
Save in faint figures and failing words,
Who loves, yet laughs among the swords,
Labours, and is at rest?

RHYME a b c b

"But some see God like Guthrum,
Crowned, with a great beard curled,
But I see God like a good giant,
That, labouring, lifts the world.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Wherefore was God in Golgotha,
Slain as a serf is slain;
And hate He had of prince and peer,
And love He had and made good cheer,
Of them that, like this woman here,
Go powerfully in pain.

RHYME a b c b

"But in this grey morn of man's life,
Cometh sometime to the mind
A little light that leaps and flies,
Like a star blown on the wind.

RHYME a b c c b

"A star of nowhere, a nameless star,
A light that spins and swirls,
And cries that even in hedge and hill,
Even on earth, it may go ill
At last with the evil earls.

RHYME a b c c c b

"A dancing sparkle, a doubtful star,
On the waste wind whirled and driven;
But it seems to sing of a wilder worth,
A time discrowned of doom and birth,
And the kingdom of the poor on earth
Come, as it is in heaven.

RHYME a b c c c b

"But even though such days endure,
How shall it profit her?
Who shall go groaning to the grave,
With many a meek and mighty slave,
Field-breaker and fisher on the wave,
And woodman and waggoner.

RHYME a b c c b

"Bake ye the big world all again
A cake with kinder leaven;
Yet these are sorry evermore--
Unless there be a little door,
A little door in heaven."

RHYME a b c c b

And as he wept for the woman
He let her business be,
And like his royal oath and rash
The good food fell upon the ash
And blackened instantly.

RHYME a b c b

Screaming, the woman caught a cake
Yet burning from the bar,
And struck him suddenly on the face,
Leaving a scarlet scar.

RHYME a b c c b

King Alfred stood up wordless,
A man dead with surprise,
And torture stood and the evil things
That are in the childish hearts of kings
An instant in his eyes.

RHYME a b c c c b

And even as he stood and stared
Drew round him in the dusk
Those friends creeping from far-off farms,
Marcus with all his slaves in arms,
And the strange spears hung with ancient charms
Of Colan of the Usk.

RHYME a b c c c b

With one whole farm marching afoot
The trampled road resounds,
Farm-hands and farm-beasts blundering by
And jars of mead and stores of rye,
Where Eldred strode above his high
And thunder-throated hounds.

RHYME a b c c b

And grey cattle and silver lowed
Against the unlifted morn,
And straw clung to the spear-shafts tall.
And a boy went before them all
Blowing a ram's horn.

RHYME a b c c b

As mocking such rude revelry,
The dim clan of the Gael
Came like a bad king's burial-end,
With dismal robes that drop and rend
And demon pipes that wail--

RHYME a b c c b

In long, outlandish garments,
Torn, though of antique worth,
With Druid beards and Druid spears,
As a resurrected race appears
Out of an elder earth.

RHYME a b c c c b

And though the King had called them forth
And knew them for his own,
So still each eye stood like a gem,
So spectral hung each broidered hem,
Grey carven men he fancied them,
Hewn in an age of stone.

RHYME a b c c c b

And the two wild peoples of the north
Stood fronting in the gloam,
And heard and knew each in its mind
The third great thunder on the wind,
The living walls that hedge mankind,
The walking walls of Rome.

RHYME a b c c c b

Mark's were the mixed tribes of the west,
Of many a hue and strain,
Gurth, with rank hair like yellow grass,
And the Cornish fisher, Gorlias,
And Halmer, come from his first mass,
Lately baptized, a Dane.

RHYME a b c c c b

But like one man in armour
Those hundreds trod the field,
From red Arabia to the Tyne
The earth had heard that marching-line,
Since the cry on the hill Capitoline,
And the fall of the golden shield.

RHYME a b c b

And the earth shook and the King stood still
Under the greenwood bough,
And the smoking cake lay at his feet
And the blow was on his brow.

RHYME a b c c c b

Then Alfred laughed out suddenly,
Like thunder in the spring,
Till shook aloud the lintel-beams,
And the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams,
And the startled birds went up in streams,
For the laughter of the King.

RHYME a b c c b

And the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down,
In a wild solemnity,
On a stranger sight than a sylph or elf,
On one man laughing at himself
Under the greenwood tree--

RHYME a b c c c b

The giant laughter of Christian men
That roars through a thousand tales,
Where greed is an ape and pride is an ass,
And Jack's away with his master's lass,
And the miser is banged with all his brass,
The farmer with all his flails;

RHYME a b c c c b

Tales that tumble and tales that trick,
Yet end not all in scorning--
Of kings and clowns in a merry plight,
And the clock gone wrong and the world gone right,
That the mummers sing upon Christmas night
And Christmas Day in the morning.

RHYME a b c b

"Now here is a good warrant,"
Cried Alfred, "by my sword;
For he that is struck for an ill servant
Should be a kind lord.

RHYME a b c b

"He that has been a servant
Knows more than priests and kings,
But he that has been an ill servant,
He knows all earthly things.

RHYME a b c b

"Pride flings frail palaces at the sky,
As a man flings up sand,
But the firm feet of humility
Take hold of heavy land.

RHYME a b c b

"Pride juggles with her toppling towers,
They strike the sun and cease,
But the firm feet of humility
They grip the ground like trees.

RHYME a b c b

"He that hath failed in a little thing
Hath a sign upon the brow;
And the Earls of the Great Army
Have no such seal to show.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The red print on my forehead,
Small flame for a red star,
In the van of the violent marching, then
When the sky is torn of the trumpets ten,
And the hands of the happy howling men
Fling wide the gates of war.

RHYME a b c c c b

"This blow that I return not
Ten times will I return
On kings and earls of all degree,
And armies wide as empires be
Shall slide like landslips to the sea
If the red star burn.

RHYME a b c c c b

"One man shall drive a hundred,
As the dead kings drave;
Before me rocking hosts be riven,
And battering cohorts backwards driven,
For I am the first king known of Heaven
That has been struck like a slave.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Up on the old white road, brothers,
Up on the Roman walls!
For this is the night of the drawing of swords,
And the tainted tower of the heathen hordes
Leans to our hammers, fires and cords,
Leans a little and falls.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Follow the star that lives and leaps,
Follow the sword that sings,
For we go gathering heathen men,
A terrible harvest, ten by ten,
As the wrath of the last red autumn--then
When Christ reaps down the kings.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Follow a light that leaps and spins,
Follow the fire unfurled!
For riseth up against realm and rod,
A thing forgotten, a thing downtrod,
The last lost giant, even God,
Is risen against the world."

RHYME a b c c c c b

Roaring they went o'er the Roman wall,
And roaring up the lane,
Their torches tossed a ladder of fire,
Higher their hymn was heard and higher,
More sweet for hate and for heart's desire,
And up in the northern scrub and brier,
They fell upon the Dane.

RHYME a b c c c b

King Guthrum was a dread king,
Like death out of the north;
Shrines without name or number
He rent and rolled as lumber,
From Chester to the Humber
He drove his foemen forth.

RHYME a b c c c b

The Roman villas heard him
In the valley of the Thames,
Come over the hills roaring
Above their roofs, and pouring
On spire and stair and flooring
Brimstone and pitch and flames.

RHYME a b c b

Sheer o'er the great chalk uplands
And the hill of the Horse went he,
Till high on Hampshire beacons
He saw the southern sea.

RHYME a b c c c b

High on the heights of Wessex
He saw the southern brine,
And turned him to a conquered land,
And where the northern thornwoods stand,
And the road parts on either hand,
There came to him a sign.

RHYME a b c c c b

King Guthrum was a war-chief,
A wise man in the field,
And though he prospered well, and knew
How Alfred's folk were sad and few,
Not less with weighty care he drew
Long lines for pike and shield.

RHYME a b c c b

King Guthrum lay on the upper land,
On a single road at gaze,
And his foe must come with lean array,
Up the left arm of the cloven way,
To the meeting of the ways.

RHYME a b c c c b

And long ere the noise of armour,
An hour ere the break of light,
The woods awoke with crash and cry,
And the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high,
And the rabbits ran like an elves' army
Ere Alfred came in sight.

RHYME a b c c c b

The live wood came at Guthrum,
On foot and claw and wing,
The nests were noisy overhead,
For Alfred and the star of red,
All life went forth, and the forest fled
Before the face of the King.

RHYME a b c c c b

But halted in the woodways
Christ's few were grim and grey,
And each with a small, far, bird-like sight
Saw the high folly of the fight;
And though strange joys had grown in the night,
Despair grew with the day.

RHYME a b c c c b

And when white dawn crawled through the wood,
Like cold foam of a flood,
Then weakened every warrior's mood,
In hope, though not in hardihood;
And each man sorrowed as he stood
In the fashion of his blood.

RHYME a b c c c b

For the Saxon Franklin sorrowed
For the things that had been fair;
For the dear dead woman, crimson-clad,
And the great feasts and the friends he had;
But the Celtic prince's soul was sad
For the things that never were.

RHYME a b c b

In the eyes Italian all things
But a black laughter died;
And Alfred flung his shield to earth
And smote his breast and cried--

RHYME a b c b

"I wronged a man to his slaying,
And a woman to her shame,
And once I looked on a sworn maid
That was wed to the Holy Name.

RHYME a b c b

"And once I took my neighbour's wife,
That was bound to an eastland man,
In the starkness of my evil youth,
Before my griefs began.

RHYME a b c c c b

"People, if you have any prayers,
Say prayers for me:
And lay me under a Christian stone
In that lost land I thought my own,
To wait till the holy horn is blown,
And all poor men are free."

RHYME a b c c c b

Then Eldred of the idle farm
Leaned on his ancient sword,
As fell his heavy words and few;
And his eyes were of such alien blue
As gleams where the Northman saileth new
Into an unknown fiord.

RHYME a b c b

"I was a fool and wasted ale--
My slaves found it sweet;
I was a fool and wasted bread,
And the birds had bread to eat.

RHYME a b c c b

"The kings go up and the kings go down,
And who knows who shall rule;
Next night a king may starve or sleep,
But men and birds and beasts shall weep
At the burial of a fool.

RHYME a b c c b

"O, drunkards in my cellar,
Boys in my apple tree,
The world grows stern and strange and new,
And wise men shall govern you,
And you shall weep for me.

RHYME a b c c c b

"But yoke me my own oxen,
Down to my own farm;
My own dog will whine for me,
My own friends will bend the knee,
And the foes I slew openly
Have never wished me harm."

RHYME a b c c c b

And all were moved a little,
But Colan stood apart,
Having first pity, and after
Hearing, like rat in rafter,
That little worm of laughter
That eats the Irish heart.

RHYME a b c b

And his grey-green eyes were cruel,
And the smile of his mouth waxed hard,
And he said, "And when did Britain
Become your burying-yard?

RHYME a b c b

"Before the Romans lit the land,
When schools and monks were none,
We reared such stones to the sun-god
As might put out the sun.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The tall trees of Britain
We worshipped and were wise,
But you shall raid the whole land through
And never a tree shall talk to you,
Though every leaf is a tongue taught true
And the forest is full of eyes.

RHYME a b c b

"On one round hill to the seaward
The trees grow tall and grey
And the trees talk together
When all men are away.

RHYME a b c b

"O'er a few round hills forgotten
The trees grow tall in rings,
And the trees talk together
Of many pagan things.

RHYME a b c b

"Yet I could lie and listen
With a cross upon my clay,
And hear unhurt for ever
What the trees of Britain say."

RHYME a b c b

A proud man was the Roman,
His speech a single one,
But his eyes were like an eagle's eyes
That is staring at the sun.

RHYME a b c b

"Dig for me where I die," he said,
"If first or last I fall--
Dead on the fell at the first charge,
Or dead by Wantage wall;

RHYME a b c b

"Lift not my head from bloody ground,
Bear not my body home,
For all the earth is Roman earth
And I shall die in Rome."

RHYME a b c c b

Then Alfred, King of England,
Bade blow the horns of war,
And fling the Golden Dragon out,
With crackle and acclaim and shout,
Scrolled and aflame and far.

RHYME a b c c b

And under the Golden Dragon
Went Wessex all along,
Past the sharp point of the cloven ways,
Out from the black wood into the blaze
Of sun and steel and song.

RHYME a b c c c b

And when they came to the open land
They wheeled, deployed and stood;
Midmost were Marcus and the King,
And Eldred on the right-hand wing,
And leftwards Colan darkling,
In the last shade of the wood.

RHYME a b c c c b

But the Earls of the Great Army
Lay like a long half moon,
Ten poles before their palisades,
With wide-winged helms and runic blades
Red giants of an age of raids,
In the thornland of Ethandune.

RHYME a b c c c b

Midmost the saddles rose and swayed,
And a stir of horses' manes,
Where Guthrum and a few rode high
On horses seized in victory;
But Ogier went on foot to die,
In the old way of the Danes.

RHYME a b c c b

Far to the King's left Elf the bard
Led on the eastern wing
With songs and spells that change the blood;
And on the King's right Harold stood,
The kinsman of the King.

RHYME a b c c c b

Young Harold, coarse, with colours gay,
Smoking with oil and musk,
And the pleasant violence of the young,
Pushed through his people, giving tongue
Foewards, where, grey as cobwebs hung,
The banners of the Usk.

RHYME a b c c c b

But as he came before his line
A little space along,
His beardless face broke into mirth,
And he cried: "What broken bits of earth
Are here? For what their clothes are worth
I would sell them for a song."

RHYME a b c b

For Colan was hung with raiment
Tattered like autumn leaves,
And his men were all as thin as saints,
And all as poor as thieves.

RHYME a b c b

No bows nor slings nor bolts they bore,
But bills and pikes ill-made;
And none but Colan bore a sword,
And rusty was its blade.

RHYME a b c b

And Colan's eyes with mystery
And iron laughter stirred,
And he spoke aloud, but lightly
Not labouring to be heard.

RHYME a b c b

"Oh, truly we be broken hearts,
For that cause, it is said,
We light our candles to that Lord
That broke Himself for bread.

RHYME a b c b

"But though we hold but bitterly
What land the Saxon leaves,
Though Ireland be but a land of saints,
And Wales a land of thieves,

RHYME a b c b

"I say you yet shall weary
Of the working of your word,
That stricken spirits never strike
Nor lean hands hold a sword.

RHYME a b c b

"And if ever ye ride in Ireland,
The jest may yet be said,
There is the land of broken hearts,
And the land of broken heads."

RHYME a b c b

Not less barbarian laughter
Choked Harold like a flood,
"And shall I fight with scarecrows
That am of Guthrum's blood?

RHYME a b c b

"Meeting may be of war-men,
Where the best war-man wins;
But all this carrion a man shoots
Before the fight begins."

RHYME a b c c c b

And stopping in his onward strides,
He snatched a bow in scorn
From some mean slave, and bent it on
Colan, whose doom grew dark; and shone
Stars evil over Caerleon,
In the place where he was born.

RHYME a b c b

For Colan had not bow nor sling,
On a lonely sword leaned he,
Like Arthur on Excalibur
In the battle by the sea.

RHYME a b c b

To his great gold ear-ring Harold
Tugged back the feathered tail,
And swift had sprung the arrow,
But swifter sprang the Gael.

RHYME a b c c c b

Whirling the one sword round his head,
A great wheel in the sun,
He sent it splendid through the sky,
Flying before the shaft could fly--
It smote Earl Harold over the eye,
And blood began to run.

RHYME a b c c c b

Colan stood bare and weaponless,
Earl Harold, as in pain,
Strove for a smile, put hand to head,
Stumbled and suddenly fell dead;
And the small white daisies all waxed red
With blood out of his brain.

RHYME a b c c c b

And all at that marvel of the sword,
Cast like a stone to slay,
Cried out. Said Alfred: "Who would see
Signs, must give all things. Verily
Man shall not taste of victory
Till he throws his sword away."

RHYME a b c c b

Then Alfred, prince of England,
And all the Christian earls,
Unhooked their swords and held them up,
Each offered to Colan, like a cup
Of chrysolite and pearls.

RHYME a b c c c b

And the King said, "Do thou take my sword
Who have done this deed of fire,
For this is the manner of Christian men,
Whether of steel or priestly pen,
That they cast their hearts out of their ken
To get their heart's desire.

RHYME a b c b

"And whether ye swear a hive of monks,
Or one fair wife to friend,
This is the manner of Christian men,
That their oath endures the end.

RHYME a b c b

"For love, our Lord, at the end of the world,
Sits a red horse like a throne,
With a brazen helm and an iron bow,
But one arrow alone.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Love with the shield of the Broken Heart
Ever his bow doth bend,
With a single shaft for a single prize,
And the ultimate bolt that parts and flies
Comes with a thunder of split skies,
And a sound of souls that rend.

RHYME a b c c b

"So shall you earn a king's sword,
Who cast your sword away."
And the King took, with a random eye,
A rude axe from a hind hard by
And turned him to the fray.

RHYME a b c c c b

For the swords of the Earls of Daneland
Flamed round the fallen lord.
The first blood woke the trumpet-tune,
As in monk's rhyme or wizard's rune,
Beginneth the battle of Ethandune
With the throwing of the sword.

RHYME a b c c c b

As the sea flooding the flat sands
Flew on the sea-born horde,
The two hosts shocked with dust and din,
Left of the Latian paladin,
Clanged all Prince Harold's howling kin
On Colan and the sword.

RHYME a b c c c b

Crashed in the midst on Marcus,
Ogier with Guthrum by,
And eastward of such central stir,
Far to the right and faintlier,
The house of Elf the harp-player,
Struck Eldred's with a cry.

RHYME a b c b

The centre swat for weariness,
Stemming the screaming horde,
And wearily went Colan's hands
That swung King Alfred's sword.

RHYME a b c b

But like a cloud of morning
To eastward easily,
Tall Eldred broke the sea of spears
As a tall ship breaks the sea.

RHYME a b c c b

His face like a sanguine sunset,
His shoulder a Wessex down,
His hand like a windy hammer-stroke;
Men could not count the crests he broke,
So fast the crests went down.

RHYME a b c b

As the tall white devil of the Plague
Moves out of Asian skies,
With his foot on a waste of cities
And his head in a cloud of flies;

RHYME a b c c c b

Or purple and peacock skies grow dark
With a moving locust-tower;
Or tawny sand-winds tall and dry,
Like hell's red banners beat and fly,
When death comes out of Araby,
Was Eldred in his hour.

RHYME a b c b

But while he moved like a massacre
He murmured as in sleep,
And his words were all of low hedges
And little fields and sheep.

RHYME a b c b

Even as he strode like a pestilence,
That strides from Rhine to Rome,
He thought how tall his beans might be
If ever he went home.

RHYME a b c b

Spoke some stiff piece of childish prayer,
Dull as the distant chimes,
That thanked our God for good eating
And corn and quiet times--

RHYME a b c b

Till on the helm of a high chief
Fell shatteringly his brand,
And the helm broke and the bone broke
And the sword broke in his hand.

RHYME a b c b

Then from the yelling Northmen
Driven splintering on him ran
Full seven spears, and the seventh
Was never made by man.

RHYME a b c b

Seven spears, and the seventh
Was wrought as the faerie blades,
And given to Elf the minstrel
By the monstrous water-maids;

RHYME a b c b

By them that dwell where luridly
Lost waters of the Rhine
Move among roots of nations,
Being sunken for a sign.

RHYME a b c c b

Under all graves they murmur,
They murmur and rebel,
Down to the buried kingdoms creep,
And like a lost rain roar and weep
O'er the red heavens of hell.

RHYME a b c b

Thrice drowned was Elf the minstrel,
And washed as dead on sand;
And the third time men found him
The spear was in his hand.

RHYME a b c b

Seven spears went about Eldred,
Like stays about a mast;
But there was sorrow by the sea
For the driving of the last.

RHYME a b c b

Six spears thrust upon Eldred
Were splintered while he laughed;
One spear thrust into Eldred,
Three feet of blade and shaft.

RHYME a b c b

And from the great heart grievously
Came forth the shaft and blade,
And he stood with the face of a dead man,
Stood a little, and swayed--

RHYME a b c c c b

Then fell, as falls a battle-tower,
On smashed and struggling spears.
Cast down from some unconquered town
That, rushing earthward, carries down
Loads of live men of all renown--
Archers and engineers.

RHYME a b c b

And a great clamour of Christian men
Went up in agony,
Crying, "Fallen is the tower of Wessex
That stood beside the sea."

RHYME a b c c b

Centre and right the Wessex guard
Grew pale for doubt and fear,
And the flank failed at the advance,
For the death-light on the wizard lance--
The star of the evil spear.

RHYME a b c b

"Stand like an oak," cried Marcus,
"Stand like a Roman wall!
Eldred the Good is fallen--
Are you too good to fall?

RHYME a b c b

"When we were wan and bloodless
He gave you ale enow;
The pirates deal with him as dung,
God! are you bloodless now?"

RHYME a b c c c b

"Grip, Wulf and Gorlias, grip the ash!
Slaves, and I make you free!
Stamp, Hildred hard in English land,
Stand Gurth, stand Gorlias, Gawen stand!
Hold, Halfgar, with the other hand,
Halmer, hold up on knee!

RHYME a b c c b

"The lamps are dying in your homes,
The fruits upon your bough;
Even now your old thatch smoulders, Gurth,
Now is the judgment of the earth,
Now is the death-grip, now!"

RHYME a b c c b

For thunder of the captain,
Not less the Wessex line,
Leaned back and reeled a space to rear
As Elf charged with the Rhine maids' spear,
And roaring like the Rhine.

RHYME a b c c c b

For the men were borne by the waving walls
Of woods and clouds that pass,
By dizzy plains and drifting sea,
And they mixed God with glamoury,
God with the gods of the burning tree
And the wizard's tower and glass.

RHYME a b c c c b

But Mark was come of the glittering towns
Where hot white details show,
Where men can number and expound,
And his faith grew in a hard ground
Of doubt and reason and falsehood found,
Where no faith else could grow.

RHYME a b c b

Belief that grew of all beliefs
One moment back was blown
And belief that stood on unbelief
Stood up iron and alone.

RHYME a b c c b

The Wessex crescent backwards
Crushed, as with bloody spear
Went Elf roaring and routing,
And Mark against Elf yet shouting,
Shocked, in his mid-career.

RHYME a b c c c b

Right on the Roman shield and sword
Did spear of the Rhine maids run;
But the shield shifted never,
The sword rang down to sever,
The great Rhine sang for ever,
And the songs of Elf were done.

RHYME a b c b

And a great thunder of Christian men
Went up against the sky,
Saying, "God hath broken the evil spear
Ere the good man's blood was dry."

RHYME a b c c c b

"Spears at the charge!" yelled Mark amain.
"Death on the gods of death!
Over the thrones of doom and blood
Goeth God that is a craftsman good,
And gold and iron, earth and wood,
Loveth and laboureth.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The fruits leap up in all your farms,
The lamps in each abode;
God of all good things done on earth,
All wheels or webs of any worth,
The God that makes the roof, Gurth,
The God that makes the road.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The God that heweth kings in oak
Writeth songs on vellum,
God of gold and flaming glass,
Confregit potentias
Acrcuum, scutum, Gorlias,
Gladium et bellum."

RHYME a b c c c b

Steel and lightning broke about him,
Battle-bays and palm,
All the sea-kings swayed among
Woods of the Wessex arms upflung,
The trumpet of the Roman tongue,
The thunder of the psalm.

RHYME a b c c b

And midmost of that rolling field
Ran Ogier ragingly,
Lashing at Mark, who turned his blow,
And brake the helm about his brow,
And broke him to his knee.

RHYME a b c c c b

Then Ogier heaved over his head
His huge round shield of proof;
But Mark set one foot on the shield,
One on some sundered rock upheeled,
And towered above the tossing field,
A statue on a roof.

RHYME a b c c b

Dealing far blows about the fight,
Like thunder-bolts a-roam,
Like birds about the battle-field,
While Ogier writhed under his shield
Like a tortoise in his dome.

RHYME a b c c c b

But hate in the buried Ogier
Was strong as pain in hell,
With bare brute hand from the inside
He burst the shield of brass and hide,
And a death-stroke to the Roman's side
Sent suddenly and well.

RHYME a b c c c b

Then the great statue on the shield
Looked his last look around
With level and imperial eye;
And Mark, the man from Italy,
Fell in the sea of agony,
And died without a sound.

RHYME a b c b

And Ogier, leaping up alive,
Hurled his huge shield away
Flying, as when a juggler flings
A whizzing plate in play.

RHYME a b c b

And held two arms up rigidly,
And roared to all the Danes:
"Fallen is Rome, yea, fallen
The city of the plains!

RHYME a b c b

"Shall no man born remember,
That breaketh wood or weald,
How long she stood on the roof of the world
As he stood on my shield.

RHYME a b c b

"The new wild world forgetteth her
As foam fades on the sea,
How long she stood with her foot on Man
As he with his foot on me.

RHYME a b c b

"No more shall the brown men of the south
Move like the ants in lines,
To quiet men with olives
Or madden men with vines.

RHYME a b c b

"No more shall the white towns of the south,
Where Tiber and Nilus run,
Sitting around a secret sea
Worship a secret sun.

RHYME a b c b

"The blind gods roar for Rome fallen,
And forum and garland gone,
For the ice of the north is broken,
And the sea of the north comes on.

RHYME a b c b

"The blind gods roar and rave and dream
Of all cities under the sea,
For the heart of the north is broken,
And the blood of the north is free.

RHYME a b c b

"Down from the dome of the world we come,
Rivers on rivers down,
Under us swirl the sects and hordes
And the high dooms we drown.

RHYME a b c c b

"Down from the dome of the world and down,
Struck flying as a skiff
On a river in spate is spun and swirled
Until we come to the end of the world
That breaks short, like a cliff.

RHYME a b c b

"And when we come to the end of the world
For me, I count it fit
To take the leap like a good river,
Shot shrieking over it.

RHYME a b c b

"But whatso hap at the end of the world,
Where Nothing is struck and sounds,
It is not, by Thor, these monkish men
These humbled Wessex hounds--

RHYME a b c b

"Not this pale line of Christian hinds,
This one white string of men,
Shall keep us back from the end of the world,
And the things that happen then.

RHYME a b c c b

"It is not Alfred's dwarfish sword,
Nor Egbert's pigmy crown,
Shall stay us now that descend in thunder,
Rending the realms and the realms thereunder,
Down through the world and down."

RHYME a b c c b

There was that in the wild men back of him,
There was that in his own wild song,
A dizzy throbbing, a drunkard smoke,
That dazed to death all Wessex folk,
And swept their spears along.

RHYME a b c b

Vainly the sword of Colan
And the axe of Alfred plied--
The Danes poured in like a brainless plague,
And knew not when they died.

RHYME a b c b

Prince Colan slew a score of them,
And was stricken to his knee;
King Alfred slew a score and seven
And was borne back on a tree.

RHYME a b c b

Back to the black gate of the woods,
Back up the single way,
Back by the place of the parting ways
Christ's knights were whirled away.

RHYME a b c c c b

And when they came to the parting ways
Doom's heaviest hammer fell,
For the King was beaten, blind, at bay,
Down the right lane with his array,
But Colan swept the other way,
Where he smote great strokes and fell.

RHYME a b c c c b

The thorn-woods over Ethandune
Stand sharp and thick as spears,
By night and furze and forest-harms
Far sundered were the friends in arms;
The loud lost blows, the last alarms,
Came not to Alfred's ears.

RHYME a b c c c b

The thorn-woods over Ethandune
Stand stiff as spikes in mail;
As to the Haut King came at morn
Dead Roland on a doubtful horn,
Seemed unto Alfred lightly borne
The last cry of the Gael.

RHYME a b c c b

Away in the waste of White Horse Down
An idle child alone
Played some small game through hours that pass,
And patiently would pluck the grass,
Patiently push the stone.

RHYME a b c c b

On the lean, green edge for ever,
Where the blank chalk touched the turf,
The child played on, alone, divine,
As a child plays on the last line
That sunders sand and surf.

RHYME a b c c b

For he dwelleth in high divisions
Too simple to understand,
Seeing on what morn of mystery
The Uncreated rent the sea
With roarings, from the land.

RHYME a b c c b

Through the long infant hours like days
He built one tower in vain--
Piled up small stones to make a town,
And evermore the stones fell down,
And he piled them up again.

RHYME a b c b

And crimson kings on battle-towers,
And saints on Gothic spires,
And hermits on their peaks of snow,
And heroes on their pyres,

RHYME a b c c c b

And patriots riding royally,
That rush the rocking town,
Stretch hands, and hunger and aspire,
Seeking to mount where high and higher,
The child whom Time can never tire,
Sings over White Horse Down.

RHYME a b c c b

And this was the might of Alfred,
At the ending of the way;
That of such smiters, wise or wild,
He was least distant from the child,
Piling the stones all day.

RHYME a b c b

For Eldred fought like a frank hunter
That killeth and goeth home;
And Mark had fought because all arms
Rang like the name of Rome.

RHYME a b c b

And Colan fought with a double mind,
Moody and madly gay;
But Alfred fought as gravely
As a good child at play.

RHYME a b c b

He saw wheels break and work run back
And all things as they were;
And his heart was orbed like victory
And simple like despair.

RHYME a b c b

Therefore is Mark forgotten,
That was wise with his tongue and brave;
And the cairn over Colan crumbled,
And the cross on Eldred's grave.

RHYME a b c b

Their great souls went on a wind away,
And they have not tale or tomb;
And Alfred born in Wantage
Rules England till the doom.

RHYME a b c b

Because in the forest of all fears
Like a strange fresh gust from sea,
Struck him that ancient innocence
That is more than mastery.

RHYME a b c c c b

And as a child whose bricks fall down
Re-piles them o'er and o'er,
Came ruin and the rain that burns,
Returning as a wheel returns,
And crouching in the furze and ferns
He began his life once more.

RHYME a b c b

He took his ivory horn unslung
And smiled, but not in scorn:
"Endeth the Battle of Ethandune
With the blowing of a horn."

RHYME a b c c b

On a dark horse at the double way
He saw great Guthrum ride,
Heard roar of brass and ring of steel,
The laughter and the trumpet peal,
The pagan in his pride.

RHYME a b c c b

And Ogier's red and hated head
Moved in some talk or task;
But the men seemed scattered in the brier,
And some of them had lit a fire,
And one had broached a cask.

RHYME a b c b

And waggons one or two stood up,
Like tall ships in sight,
As if an outpost were encamped
At the cloven ways for night.

RHYME a b c c c b

And joyous of the sudden stay
Of Alfred's routed few,
Sat one upon a stone to sigh,
And some slipped up the road to fly,
Till Alfred in the fern hard by
Set horn to mouth and blew.

RHYME a b c c c b

And they all abode like statues--
One sitting on the stone,
One half-way through the thorn hedge tall,
One with a leg across a wall,
And one looked backwards, very small,
Far up the road, alone.

RHYME a b c c c b

Grey twilight and a yellow star
Hung over thorn and hill;
Two spears and a cloven war-shield lay
Loose on the road as cast away,
The horn died faint in the forest grey,
And the fleeing men stood still.

RHYME a b c b

"Brothers at arms," said Alfred,
"On this side lies the foe;
Are slavery and starvation flowers,
That you should pluck them so?

RHYME a b c c b

"For whether is it better
To be prodded with Danish poles,
Having hewn a chamber in a ditch,
And hounded like a howling witch,
Or smoked to death in holes?

RHYME a b c b

"Or that before the red cock crow
All we, a thousand strong,
Go down the dark road to God's house,
Singing a Wessex song?

RHYME a b c c c b

"To sweat a slave to a race of slaves,
To drink up infamy?
No, brothers, by your leave, I think
Death is a better ale to drink,
And by all the stars of Christ that sink,
The Danes shall drink with me.

RHYME a b c c c b

"To grow old cowed in a conquered land,
With the sun itself discrowned,
To see trees crouch and cattle slink--
Death is a better ale to drink,
And by high Death on the fell brink
That flagon shall go round.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Though dead are all the paladins
Whom glory had in ken,
Though all your thunder-sworded thanes
With proud hearts died among the Danes,
While a man remains, great war remains:
Now is a war of men.

RHYME a b c c b

"The men that tear the furrows,
The men that fell the trees,
When all their lords be lost and dead
The bondsmen of the earth shall tread
The tyrants of the seas.

RHYME a b c b

"The wheel of the roaring stillness
Of all labours under the sun,
Speed the wild work as well at least
As the whole world's work is done.

RHYME a b c b

"Let Hildred hack the shield-wall
Clean as he hacks the hedge;
Let Gurth the fowler stand as cool
As he stands on the chasm's edge;

RHYME a b c c b

"Let Gorlias ride the sea-kings
As Gorlias rides the sea,
Then let all hell and Denmark drive,
Yelling to all its fiends alive,
And not a rag care we."

RHYME a b c c b

When Alfred's word was ended
Stood firm that feeble line,
Each in his place with club or spear,
And fury deeper than deep fear,
And smiles as sour as brine.

RHYME a b c c c b

And the King held up the horn and said,
"See ye my father's horn,
That Egbert blew in his empery,
Once, when he rode out commonly,
Twice when he rode for venery,
And thrice on the battle-morn.

RHYME a b c c b

"But heavier fates have fallen
The horn of the Wessex kings,
And I blew once, the riding sign,
To call you to the fighting line
And glory and all good things.

RHYME a b c b

"And now two blasts, the hunting sign,
Because we turn to bay;
But I will not blow the three blasts,
Till we be lost or they.

RHYME a b c b

"And now I blow the hunting sign,
Charge some by rule and rod;
But when I blow the battle sign,
Charge all and go to God."

RHYME a b c b

Wild stared the Danes at the double ways
Where they loitered, all at large,
As that dark line for the last time
Doubled the knee to charge--

RHYME a b c c b

And caught their weapons clumsily,
And marvelled how and why--
In such degree, by rule and rod,
The people of the peace of God
Went roaring down to die.

RHYME a b c c b

And when the last arrow
Was fitted and was flown,
When the broken shield hung on the breast,
And the hopeless lance was laid in rest,
And the hopeless horn blown,

RHYME a b c c c b

The King looked up, and what he saw
Was a great light like death,
For Our Lady stood on the standards rent,
As lonely and as innocent
As when between white walls she went
And the lilies of Nazareth.

RHYME a b c c b

One instant in a still light
He saw Our Lady then,
Her dress was soft as western sky,
And she was a queen most womanly--
But she was a queen of men.

RHYME a b c c b

Over the iron forest
He saw Our Lady stand,
Her eyes were sad withouten art,
And seven swords were in her heart--
But one was in her hand.

RHYME a b c c c c b

Then the last charge went blindly,
And all too lost for fear:
The Danes closed round, a roaring ring,
And twenty clubs rose o'er the King,
Four Danes hewed at him, halloing,
And Ogier of the Stone and Sling
Drove at him with a spear.

RHYME a b c c b

But the Danes were wild with laughter,
And the great spear swung wide,
The point stuck to a straggling tree,
And either host cried suddenly,
As Alfred leapt aside.

RHYME a b c b

Short time had shaggy Ogier
To pull his lance in line--
He knew King Alfred's axe on high,
He heard it rushing through the sky,

RHYME a b c b

He cowered beneath it with a cry--
It split him to the spine:
And Alfred sprang over him dead,
And blew the battle sign.

RHYME a b c c c b

Then bursting all and blasting
Came Christendom like death,
Kicked of such catapults of will,
The staves shiver, the barrels spill,
The waggons waver and crash and kill
The waggoners beneath.

RHYME a b c b

Barriers go backwards, banners rend,
Great shields groan like a gong--
Horses like horns of nightmare
Neigh horribly and long.

RHYME a b c c c b

Horses ramp high and rock and boil
And break their golden reins,
And slide on carnage clamorously,
Down where the bitter blood doth lie,
Where Ogier went on foot to die,
In the old way of the Danes.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The high tide!" King Alfred cried.
"The high tide and the turn!
As a tide turns on the tall grey seas,
See how they waver in the trees,
How stray their spears, how knock their knees,
How wild their watchfires burn!

RHYME a b c c c b

"The Mother of God goes over them,
Walking on wind and flame,
And the storm-cloud drifts from city and dale,
And the White Horse stamps in the White Horse Vale,
And we all shall yet drink Christian ale
In the village of our name.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The Mother of God goes over them,
On dreadful cherubs borne;
And the psalm is roaring above the rune,
And the Cross goes over the sun and moon,
Endeth the battle of Ethandune
With the blowing of a horn."

RHYME a b c c c b

For back indeed disorderly
The Danes went clamouring,
Too worn to take anew the tale,
Or dazed with insolence and ale,
Or stunned of heaven, or stricken pale
Before the face of the King.

RHYME a b c c c b

For dire was Alfred in his hour
The pale scribe witnesseth,
More mighty in defeat was he
Than all men else in victory,
And behind, his men came murderously,
Dry-throated, drinking death.

RHYME a b c c c b

And Edgar of the Golden Ship
He slew with his own hand,
Took Ludwig from his lady's bower,
And smote down Harmar in his hour,
And vain and lonely stood the tower--
The tower in Guelderland.

RHYME a b c c c b

And Torr out of his tiny boat,
Whose eyes beheld the Nile,
Wulf with his war-cry on his lips,
And Harco born in the eclipse,
Who blocked the Seine with battleships
Round Paris on the Isle.

RHYME a b c c c b

And Hacon of the Harvest-Song,
And Dirck from the Elbe he slew,
And Cnut that melted Durham bell
And Fulk and fiery Oscar fell,
And Goderic and Sigael,
And Uriel of the Yew.

RHYME a b c c b

And highest sang the slaughter,
And fastest fell the slain,
When from the wood-road's blackening throat
A crowning and crashing wonder smote
The rear-guard of the Dane.

RHYME a b c c c b

For the dregs of Colan's company--
Lost down the other road--
Had gathered and grown and heard the din,
And with wild yells came pouring in,
Naked as their old British kin,
And bright with blood for woad.

RHYME a b c c c b

And bare and bloody and aloft
They bore before their band
The body of the mighty lord,
Colan of Caerleon and its horde,
That bore King Alfred's battle-sword
Broken in his left hand.

RHYME a b c c c b

And a strange music went with him,
Loud and yet strangely far;
The wild pipes of the western land,
Too keen for the ear to understand,
Sang high and deathly on each hand
When the dead man went to war.

RHYME a b c c c b

Blocked between ghost and buccaneer,
Brave men have dropped and died;
And the wild sea-lords well might quail
As the ghastly war-pipes of the Gael
Called to the horns of White Horse Vale,
And all the horns replied.

RHYME a b c c b

And Hildred the poor hedger
Cut down four captains dead,
And Halmar laid three others low,
And the great earls wavered to and fro
For the living and the dead.

RHYME a b c b

And Gorlias grasped the great flag,
The Raven of Odin, torn;
And the eyes of Guthrum altered,
For the first time since morn.

RHYME a b c c b

As a turn of the wheel of tempest
Tilts up the whole sky tall,
And cliffs of wan cloud luminous
Lean out like great walls over us,
As if the heavens might fall.

RHYME a b c c b

As such a tall and tilted sky
Sends certain snow or light,
So did the eyes of Guthrum change,
And the turn was more certain and more strange
Than a thousand men in flight.

RHYME a b c c c b

For not till the floor of the skies is split,
And hell-fire shines through the sea,
Or the stars look up through the rent earth's knees,
Cometh such rending of certainties,
As when one wise man truly sees
What is more wise than he.

RHYME a b c c c b

He set his horse in the battle-breech
Even Guthrum of the Dane,
And as ever had fallen fell his brand,
A falling tower o'er many a land,
But Gurth the fowler laid one hand
Upon this bridle rein.

RHYME a b c b

King Guthrum was a great lord,
And higher than his gods--
He put the popes to laughter,
He chid the saints with rods,

RHYME a b c b

He took this hollow world of ours
For a cup to hold his wine;
In the parting of the woodways
There came to him a sign.

RHYME a b c b

In Wessex in the forest,
In the breaking of the spears,
We set a sign on Guthrum
To blaze a thousand years.

RHYME a b c c c b

Where the high saddles jostle
And the horse-tails toss,
There rose to the birds flying
A roar of dead and dying;
In deafness and strong crying
We signed him with the cross.

RHYME a b c b

Far out to the winding river
The blood ran down for days,
When we put the cross on Guthrum
In the parting of the ways.

RHYME a b c c c b

In the years of the peace of Wessex,
When the good King sat at home;
Years following on that bloody boon
When she that stands above the moon
Stood above death at Ethandune
And saw his kingdom come--

RHYME a b c c c b

When the pagan people of the sea
Fled to their palisades,
Nailed there with javelins to cling
And wonder smote the pirate king,
And brought him to his christening
And the end of all his raids.

RHYME a b c c c b

(For not till the night's blue slate is wiped
Of its last star utterly,
And fierce new signs writ there to read,
Shall eyes with such amazement heed,
As when a great man knows indeed
A greater thing than he.)

RHYME a b c c c b

And there came to his chrism-loosing
Lords of all lands afar,
And a line was drawn north-westerly
That set King Egbert's empire free,
Giving all lands by the northern sea
To the sons of the northern star.

RHYME a b c b

In the days of the rest of Alfred,
When all these things were done,
And Wessex lay in a patch of peace,
Like a dog in a patch of sun--

RHYME a b c b

The King sat in his orchard,
Among apples green and red,
With the little book in his bosom
And the sunshine on his head.

RHYME a b c c c b

And he gathered the songs of simple men
That swing with helm and hod,
And the alms he gave as a Christian
Like a river alive with fishes ran;
And he made gifts to a beggar man
As to a wandering god.

RHYME a b c c c b

And he gat good laws of the ancient kings,
Like treasure out of the tombs;
And many a thief in thorny nook,
Or noble in sea-stained turret shook,
For the opening of his iron book,
And the gathering of the dooms.

RHYME a b c b

Then men would come from the ends of the earth,
Whom the King sat welcoming,
And men would go to the ends of the earth
Because of the word of the King.

RHYME a b c c c b

For folk came in to Alfred's face
Whose javelins had been hurled
On monsters that make boil the sea,
Crakens and coils of mystery.
Or thrust in ancient snows that be
The white hair of the world.

RHYME a b c c c b

And some had knocked at the northern gates
Of the ultimate icy floor,
Where the fish freeze and the foam turns black,
And the wide world narrows to a track,
And the other sea at the world's back
Cries through a closed door.

RHYME a b c c c b

And men went forth from Alfred's face,
Even great gift-bearing lords,
Not to Rome only, but more bold,
Out to the high hot courts of old,
Of negroes clad in cloth of gold,
Silence, and crooked swords,

RHYME a b c c b

Scrawled screens and secret gardens
And insect-laden skies--
Where fiery plains stretch on and on
To the purple country of Prester John
And the walls of Paradise.

RHYME a b c c c b

And he knew the might of the Terre Majeure,
Where kings began to reign;
Where in a night-rout, without name,
Of gloomy Goths and Gauls there came
White, above candles all aflame,
Like a vision, Charlemagne.

RHYME a b c c c b

And men, seeing such embassies,
Spake with the King and said:
"The steel that sang so sweet a tune
On Ashdown and on Ethandune,
Why hangs it scabbarded so soon,
All heavily like lead?

RHYME a b c c c b

"Why dwell the Danes in North England,
And up to the river ride?
Three more such marches like thine own
Would end them; and the Pict should own
Our sway; and our feet climb the throne
In the mountains of Strathclyde."

RHYME a b c b

And Alfred in the orchard,
Among apples green and red,
With the little book in his bosom,
Looked at green leaves and said:

RHYME a b c b

"When all philosophies shall fail,
This word alone shall fit;
That a sage feels too small for life,
And a fool too large for it.

RHYME a b c c b

"Asia and all imperial plains
Are too little for a fool;
But for one man whose eyes can see
The little island of Athelney
Is too large a land to rule.

RHYME a b c c c b

"Haply it had been better
When I built my fortress there,
Out in the reedy waters wide,
I had stood on my mud wall and cried:
`Take England all, from tide to tide--
Be Athelney my share.'

RHYME a b c c c b

"Those madmen of the throne-scramble--
Oppressors and oppressed--
Had lined the banks by Athelney,
And waved and wailed unceasingly,
Where the river turned to the broad sea,
By an island of the blest.

RHYME a b c c c b

"An island like a little book
Full of a hundred tales,
Like the gilt page the good monks pen,
That is all smaller than a wren,
Yet hath high towns, meteors, and men,
And suns and spouting whales;

RHYME a b c c c b

"A land having a light on it
In the river dark and fast,
An isle with utter clearness lit,
Because a saint had stood in it;
Where flowers are flowers indeed and fit,
And trees are trees at last.

RHYME a b c c c b

"So were the island of a saint;
But I am a common king,
And I will make my fences tough
From Wantage Town to Plymouth Bluff,
Because I am not wise enough
To rule so small a thing."

RHYME a b c c c b

And it fell in the days of Alfred,
In the days of his repose,
That as old customs in his sight
Were a straight road and a steady light,
He bade them keep the White Horse white
As the first plume of the snows.

RHYME a b c b

And right to the red torchlight,
From the trouble of morning grey,
They stripped the White Horse of the grass
As they strip it to this day.

RHYME a b c c c b

And under the red torchlight
He went dreaming as though dull,
Of his old companions slain like kings,
And the rich irrevocable things
Of a heart that hath not openings,
But is shut fast, being full.

RHYME a b c c b

And the torchlight touched the pale hair
Where silver clouded gold,
And the frame of his face was made of cords,
And a young lord turned among the lords
And said: "The King is old."

RHYME a b c c c b

And even as he said it
A post ran in amain,
Crying: "Arm, Lord King, the hamlets arm,
In the horror and the shade of harm,
They have burnt Brand of Aynger's farm--
The Danes are come again!

RHYME a b c b

"Danes drive the white East Angles
In six fights on the plains,
Danes waste the world about the Thames,
Danes to the eastward--Danes!"

RHYME a b c b

And as he stumbled on one knee,
The thanes broke out in ire,
Crying: "Ill the watchmen watch, and ill
The sheriffs keep the shire."

RHYME a b c c b

But the young earl said: "Ill the saints,
The saints of England, guard
The land wherein we pledge them gold;
The dykes decay, the King grows old,
And surely this is hard,

RHYME a b c c b

"That we be never quit of them;
That when his head is hoar
He cannot say to them he smote,
And spared with a hand hard at the throat,
`Go, and return no more.' "

RHYME a b c c c b

Then Alfred smiled. And the smile of him
Was like the sun for power.
But he only pointed: bade them heed
Those peasants of the Berkshire breed,
Who plucked the old Horse of the weed
As they pluck it to this hour.

RHYME a b c b

"Will ye part with the weeds for ever?
Or show daisies to the door?
Or will you bid the bold grass
Go, and return no more?

RHYME a b c c c b

"So ceaseless and so secret
Thrive terror and theft set free;
Treason and shame shall come to pass
While one weed flowers in a morass;
And like the stillness of stiff grass
The stillness of tyranny.

RHYME a b c b

"Over our white souls also
Wild heresies and high
Wave prouder than the plumes of grass,
And sadder than their sigh.

RHYME a b c c c b

"And I go riding against the raid,
And ye know not where I am;
But ye shall know in a day or year,
When one green star of grass grows here;
Chaos has charged you, charger and spear,
Battle-axe and battering-ram.

RHYME a b c b

"And though skies alter and empires melt,
This word shall still be true:
If we would have the horse of old,
Scour ye the horse anew.

RHYME a b c c c b

"One time I followed a dancing star
That seemed to sing and nod,
And ring upon earth all evil's knell;
But now I wot if ye scour not well
Red rust shall grow on God's great bell
And grass in the streets of God."

RHYME a b c c b

Ceased Alfred; and above his head
The grand green domes, the Downs,
Showed the first legions of the press,
Marching in haste and bitterness
For Christ's sake and the crown's.

RHYME a b c c c b

Beyond the cavern of Colan,
Past Eldred's by the sea,
Rose men that owned King Alfred's rod,
From the windy wastes of Exe untrod,
Or where the thorn of the grave of God
Burns over Glastonbury.

RHYME a b c c c b

Far northward and far westward
The distant tribes drew nigh,
Plains beyond plains, fell beyond fell,
That a man at sunset sees so well,
And the tiny coloured towns that dwell
In the corners of the sky.

RHYME a b c c b

But dark and thick as thronged the host,
With drum and torch and blade,
The still-eyed King sat pondering,
As one that watches a live thing,
The scoured chalk; and he said,

RHYME a b c c c b

"Though I give this land to Our Lady,
That helped me in Athelney,
Though lordlier trees and lustier sod
And happier hills hath no flesh trod
Than the garden of the Mother of God
Between Thames side and the sea,

RHYME a b c c c b

"I know that weeds shall grow in it
Faster than men can burn;
And though they scatter now and go,
In some far century, sad and slow,
I have a vision, and I know
The heathen shall return.

RHYME a b c b

"They shall not come with warships,
They shall not waste with brands,
But books be all their eating,
And ink be on their hands.

RHYME a b c c b

"Not with the humour of hunters
Or savage skill in war,
But ordering all things with dead words,
Strings shall they make of beasts and birds,
And wheels of wind and star.

RHYME a b c c b

"They shall come mild as monkish clerks,
With many a scroll and pen;
And backward shall ye turn and gaze,
Desiring one of Alfred's days,
When pagans still were men.

RHYME a b c c c b

"The dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns,
Like fiercer flowers on stalk,
Earth lost and little like a pea
In high heaven's towering forestry,
--These be the small weeds ye shall see
Crawl, covering the chalk.

RHYME a b c c b

"But though they bridge St. Mary's sea,
Or steal St. Michael's wing--
Though they rear marvels over us,
Greater than great Vergilius
Wrought for the Roman king;

RHYME a b c b

"By this sign you shall know them,
The breaking of the sword,
And man no more a free knight,
That loves or hates his lord.

RHYME a b c b

"Yea, this shall be the sign of them,
The sign of the dying fire;
And Man made like a half-wit,
That knows not of his sire.

RHYME a b c b

"What though they come with scroll and pen,
And grave as a shaven clerk,
By this sign you shall know them,
That they ruin and make dark;

RHYME a b c b

"By all men bond to Nothing,
Being slaves without a lord,
By one blind idiot world obeyed,
Too blind to be abhorred;

RHYME a b c c c b

"By terror and the cruel tales
Of curse in bone and kin,
By weird and weakness winning,
Accursed from the beginning,
By detail of the sinning,
And denial of the sin;

RHYME a b c b

"By thought a crawling ruin,
By life a leaping mire,
By a broken heart in the breast of the world,
And the end of the world's desire;

RHYME a b c b

"By God and man dishonoured,
By death and life made vain,
Know ye the old barbarian,
The barbarian come again--

RHYME a b c b

"When is great talk of trend and tide,
And wisdom and destiny,
Hail that undying heathen
That is sadder than the sea.

RHYME a b c c c b

"In what wise men shall smite him,
Or the Cross stand up again,
Or charity or chivalry,
My vision saith not; and I see
No more; but now ride doubtfully
To the battle of the plain."

RHYME a b c c c b

And the grass-edge of the great down
Was cut clean as a lawn,
While the levies thronged from near and far,
From the warm woods of the western star,
And the King went out to his last war
On a tall grey horse at dawn.

RHYME a b c b

And news of his far-off fighting
Came slowly and brokenly
From the land of the East Saxons,
From the sunrise and the sea.

RHYME a b c b

From the plains of the white sunrise,
And sad St. Edmund's crown,
Where the pools of Essex pale and gleam
Out beyond London Town--

RHYME a b c c b

In mighty and doubtful fragments,
Like faint or fabled wars,
Climbed the old hills of his renown,
Where the bald brow of White Horse Down
Is close to the cold stars.

RHYME a b c c b

But away in the eastern places
The wind of death walked high,
And a raid was driven athwart the raid,
The sky reddened and the smoke swayed,
And the tall grey horse went by.

RHYME a b c c b

The gates of the great river
Were breached as with a barge,
The walls sank crowded, say the scribes,
And high towers populous with tribes
Seemed leaning from the charge.

RHYME a b c b

Smoke like rebellious heavens rolled
Curled over coloured flames,
Mirrored in monstrous purple dreams
In the mighty pools of Thames.

RHYME a b c c b

Loud was the war on London wall,
And loud in London gates,
And loud the sea-kings in the cloud
Broke through their dreaming gods, and loud
Cried on their dreadful Fates.

RHYME a b c c b

And all the while on White Horse Hill
The horse lay long and wan,
The turf crawled and the fungus crept,
And the little sorrel, while all men slept,
Unwrought the work of man.

RHYME a b c c c b

With velvet finger, velvet foot,
The fierce soft mosses then
Crept on the large white commonweal
All folk had striven to strip and peel,
And the grass, like a great green witch's wheel,
Unwound the toils of men.

RHYME a b c b

And clover and silent thistle throve,
And buds burst silently,
With little care for the Thames Valley
Or what things there might be--

RHYME a b c c c b

That away on the widening river,
In the eastern plains for crown
Stood up in the pale purple sky
One turret of smoke like ivory;
And the smoke changed and the wind went by,
And the King took London Town.

TITLE Lepanto

RHYME a a *

White founts falling in the courts of the sun,
And the Soldan of Byzantium is smiling as they run;
There is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared,
It stirs the forest darkness, the darkness of his beard,
It curls the blood-red crescent, the crescent of his lips,
For the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships.
They have dared the white republics up the capes of Italy,
They have dashed the Adriatic round the Lion of the Sea,
And the Pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss,
And called the kings of Christendom for swords about the Cross,
The cold queen of England is looking in the glass;
The shadow of the Valois is yawning at the Mass;
From evening isles, fantastical rings faint the Spanish gun,
And the Lord upon the Golden Horn is laughing in the sun.

RHYME a a *

Dim drums throbbing, in the hills half heard,
Where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred,
Where, risen from a doubtful seat and half-attainted stall,
The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall,
The last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung,
That once went singing southward when all the world was young.
In that enormous silence, tiny and unafraid,
Comes up along a winding road the noise of the Crusade.
Strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far,
Don John of Austria is going to the war,
Stiff flags straining in the night-blasts cold
In the gloom black-purple, in the glint old-gold,
Torchlight crimson on the copper kettle-drums,
Then the tuckets, then the trumpets, then the cannon, and he comes.
Don John laughing in the brave beard curled,
Spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world,

RHYME a b b b a

Holding his head up for a flag of all the free.
Love-light of Spain - hurrah! 
Death-light of Africa!
Don John of Austria
Is riding to the sea.

RHYME a a *

Mahound is in his paradise above the evening star,
(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)
He moves a mighty turban on the timeless houri's knees,
His turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas.
He shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease,
And he strides among the tree-tops and is taller than the trees,

RHYME a a b b b a

And his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
Black Azrael and Ariel and Ammon on the wing.
Giants and the Genii,
Multiplex of wing and eye,
Whose strong obedience broke the sky
When Solomon was king.

RHYME a a *

They rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn,
From temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn;
They rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea
Where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be;
On them the sea-valves cluster and the grey sea-forests curl,
Splashed with a splendid sickness, the sickness of the pearl;
They swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground, -
They gather and they wonder and give worship to Mahound.
And he saith, "Break up the mountains where the hermit-folk may hide,
And sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide,
And chase the Giaours flying night and day, not giving rest,
For that which was our trouble comes again out of the west.
We have set the seal of Solomon on all things under sun,
Of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done,
But a noise is in the mountains, in the mountains, and I know
The voice that shook our palaces - four hundred years ago:
It is he that saith not 'Kismet'; it is he that knows not Fate;
It is Richard, it is Raymond, it is Godfrey in the gate!
It is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth,
Put down your feet upon him, that our peace be on the earth."

RHYME a a b b b a

For he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar,
(Don John of Austria is going to the war.)
Sudden and still - hurrah!
Bolt from Iberia!
Don John of Austria
Is gone by Alcalar.

St. Michael's on his Mountain in the sea-roads of the north
(Don John of Austria is girt and going forth.)
Where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift
And the sea-folk labour and the red sails lift.
He shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone;
The noise is gone through Normandy; the noise is gone alone;
The North is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes
And dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise,
And Christian killeth Christian in a narrow dusty room,
And Christian dreadeth Christ that bath a newer face of doom,
And Christian hateth Mary that God kissed in Galilee,
But Don John of Austria is riding to the sea.

RHYME a a b b b a

Don John calling through the blast and the eclipse
Crying with the trumpet, with the trumpet of his lips,
Trumpet that sayeth ha!

King Philip's in his closet with the Fleece about his neck
(Don John of Austria is armed upon the deck.)
The walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin,
And little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in.
He holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon,
He touches, and it tingles, and he trembles very soon,
And his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey
Like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day,
And death is in the phial and the end of noble work,
But Don John of Austria has fired upon the Turk.

RHYME a a b b b a

Don John's hunting, and his hounds have bayed -
Booms away past Italy the rumour of his raid.
Gun upon gun, ha! ha!
Gun upon gun, hurrah!
Don John of Austria
Has loosed the cannonade.

The Pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke,
(Don John of Austria is hidden in the smoke.)
The hidden room in a man's house where God sits all the year,
The secret window whence the world looks small and very dear.
He sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea
The crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery;
They fling great shadows foe-wards, making Cross and Castle dark,
They veil the plumed lions on the galleys of St. Mark;
And above the ships are palaces of brown, black-bearded chiefs,
And below the ships are prisons, where with multitudinous griefs,
Christian captives sick and sunless, all a labouring race repines
Like a race in sunken cities, like a nation in the mines.
They are lost like slaves that swat, and in the skies of morning hung
The stairways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young.

RHYME a a *

They are countless, voiceless, hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on
Before the high Kings' horses in the granite of Babylon.
And many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell
Where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell,
And he finds his God forgotten, and he seeks no more a sign -
(But Don John of Austria has burst the battle-line!)
Don John pounding from the slaughter-painted poop,
Purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirate's sloop,
Scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds,
Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds,

RHYME a a b b b a

Thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea
White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty.
Vivat Hispania!

Don John of Austria
Has set his people free!

Cervantes on his galley sets the sword back in the sheath
(Don John of Austria rides homeward with a wreath.)
And he sees across a weary land a straggling road in Spain,
Up which a lean and foolish knight forever rides in vain,
And he smiles, but not as Sultans smile, and settles back the blade. . .
(But Don John of Austria rides home from the Crusade.)

TITLE The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

RHYME a b c b 

    It is an ancyent Marinere,
      And he stoppeth one of three:
    "By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye
      "Now wherefore stoppest me?

RHYME a b c b 

    "The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide
      "And I am next of kin;
    "The Guests are met, the Feast is set,--
      "May'st hear the merry din.--

RHYME a b c b 

    But still he holds the wedding-guest--
      There was a Ship, quoth he--
    "Nay, if thou'st got a laughsome tale,
      "Marinere! come with me."

RHYME a b c b 

    He holds him with his skinny hand,
      Quoth he, there was a Ship--
    "Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon!
      "Or my Staff shall make thee skip."

RHYME a b c b 

    He holds him with his glittering eye--
      The wedding guest stood still
    And listens like a three year's child;
      The Marinere hath his will.

RHYME a b c b 

    The wedding-guest sate on a stone,
      He cannot chuse but hear:
    And thus spake on that ancyent man,
      The bright-eyed Marinere.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Ship was cheer'd, the Harbour clear'd--
      Merrily did we drop
    Below the Kirk, below the Hill,
      Below the Light-house top.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Sun came up upon the left,
      Out of the Sea came he:
    And he shone bright, and on the right
      Went down into the Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

   Higher and higher every day,
      Till over the mast at noon--
    The wedding-guest here beat his breast,
      For he heard the loud bassoon.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Bride hath pac'd into the Hall,
      Red as a rose is she;
    Nodding their heads before her goes
      The merry Minstralsy.

RHYME a b c b 

    The wedding-guest he beat his breast,
      Yet he cannot chuse but hear:
    And thus spake on that ancyent Man,
      The bright-eyed Marinere.

RHYME a b c b 

    Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind,
      A Wind and Tempest strong!
    For days and weeks it play'd us freaks--
      Like Chaff we drove along.

RHYME a b c b 

    Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,
      And it grew wond'rous cauld:
    And Ice mast-high came floating by
      As green as Emerauld.

RHYME a b c b 

    And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts
      Did send a dismal sheen;
    Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken--
      The Ice was all between.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Ice was here, the Ice was there,
      The Ice was all around:
    It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd--
      Like noises of a swound.

RHYME a b c b 

    At length did cross an Albatross,
      Thorough the Fog it came;
    And an it were a Christian Soul,
      We hail'd it in God's name.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,
      And round and round it flew:
    The Ice did split with a Thunder-fit;
      The Helmsman steer'd us thro'.

RHYME a b c b 

    And a good south wind sprung up behind,
      The Albatross did follow;
    And every day for food or play
      Came to the Marinere's hollo!

RHYME a b c b 

    In mist or cloud on mast or shroud
      It perch'd for vespers nine,
    Whiles all the night thro' fog-smoke white
      Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.

RHYME a b c b 

    "God save thee, ancyent Marinere!
      "From the fiends that plague thee thus--
    "Why look'st thou so?"--with my cross bow
      I shot the Albatross.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Sun came up upon the right,
      Out of the Sea came he;
    And broad as a weft upon the left
      Went down into the Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    And the good south wind still blew behind,
      But no sweet Bird did follow
    Ne any day for food or play
      Came to the Marinere's hollo!

RHYME a b c b 

    And I had done an hellish thing
      And it would work 'em woe:
    For all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird
      That made the Breeze to blow.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,
      The glorious Sun uprist:
    Then all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird
      That brought the fog and mist.
    'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay
      That bring the fog and mist.

RHYME a b c b 

    The breezes blew, the white foam flew,
      The furrow follow'd free:
    We were the first that ever burst
      Into that silent Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,
      'Twas sad as sad could be
    And we did speak only to break
      The silence of the Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    All in a hot and copper sky
      The bloody sun at noon,
    Right up above the mast did stand,
      No bigger than the moon.

RHYME a b c b 

    Day after day, day after day,
      We stuck, ne breath ne motion,
    As idle as a painted Ship
      Upon a painted Ocean.

RHYME a b c b 

    Water, water, every where
      And all the boards did shrink;
    Water, water, every where,
      Ne any drop to drink.

RHYME a b c b 

    The very deeps did rot: O Christ!
      That ever this should be!
    Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
      Upon the slimy Sea.

RHYME a b c b 

    About, about, in reel and rout
      The Death-fires danc'd at night;
    The water, like a witch's oils,
      Burnt green and blue and white.

RHYME a b c b 

    And some in dreams assured were
      Of the Spirit that plagued us so:
    Nine fathom deep he had follow'd us
      From the Land of Mist and Snow.

RHYME a b c b 

    And every tongue thro' utter drouth
      Was wither'd at the root;
    We could not speak no more than if
      We had been choked with soot.

RHYME a b c b 

    Ah wel-a-day! what evil looks
      Had I from old and young;
    Instead of the Cross the Albatross
      About my neck was hung.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    I saw a something in the Sky	
      No bigger than my fist;		
    At first it seem'd a little speck	
      And then it seem'd a mist:	
    It mov'd and mov'd, and took at last
      A certain shape, I wist.		
      
RHYME a b c b 

    A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!	
      And still it ner'd and ner'd;	
    And, an it dodg'd a water-sprite,	
      It plung'd and tack'd and veer'd.

RHYME a b c c b 

    With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd
      Ne could we laugh, ne wail:
    Then while thro' drouth all dumb they stood
    I bit my arm and suck'd the blood
      And cry'd, A sail! a sail!

RHYME a b c c b 

    With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd
      Agape they hear'd me call:
    Gramercy! they for joy did grin
    And all at once their breath drew in
      As they were drinking all.

RHYME a b a b 

    She doth not tack from side to side--
      Hither to work us weal
    Withouten wind, withouten tide
      She steddies with upright keel.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The western wave was all a flame,
      The day was well nigh done!
    Almost upon the western wave
      Rested the broad bright Sun;
    When that strange shape drove suddenly
      Betwixt us and the Sun.

RHYME a b c b 

    And strait the Sun was fleck'd with bars
      (Heaven's mother send us grace)
    As if thro' a dungeon grate he peer'd
      With broad and burning face.

RHYME a b c b 

    Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
      How fast she neres and neres!
    Are those _her_ Sails that glance in the Sun
      Like restless gossameres?

RHYME a b c b 

    Are these _her_ naked ribs, which fleck'd
      The sun that did behind them peer?
    And are these two all, all the crew,
      That woman and her fleshless Pheere?

RHYME a b c c b 

    _His_ bones were black with many a crack,
      All black and bare, I ween;
    Jet-black and bare, save where with rust
    Of mouldy damps and charnel crust
      They're patch'd with purple and green.

RHYME a b a a b 

    _Her_ lips are red, _her_ looks are free,
      _Her_ locks are yellow as gold:
    Her skin is as white as leprosy,
    And she is far liker Death than he;
      Her flesh makes the still air cold.

RHYME a b c b 

    The naked Hulk alongside came
      And the Twain were playing dice;
    "The Game is done! I've won, I've won!"
      Quoth she, and whistled thrice.

RHYME a b c b 

    A gust of wind sterte up behind
      And whistled thro' his bones;
    Thro' the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth
      Half-whistles and half-groans.

RHYME a b a a b 

    With never a whisper in the Sea
      Off darts the Spectre-ship;
    While clombe above the Eastern bar
    The horned Moon, with one bright Star
      Almost atween the tips.

RHYME a b c b 

    One after one by the horned Moon
      (Listen, O Stranger! to me)
    Each turn'd his face with a ghastly pang
      And curs'd me with his ee.

RHYME a b c b 

    Four times fifty living men,
      With never a sigh or groan,
    With heavy thump, a lifeless lump
      They dropp'd down one by one.

RHYME a b a b 

    Their souls did from their bodies fly,--
      They fled to bliss or woe;
    And every soul it pass'd me by,
      Like the whiz of my Cross-bow.

RHYME a b c b 

    "I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!
      "I fear thy skinny hand;
    "And thou art long and lank and brown
      "As is the ribb'd Sea-sand.

RHYME a b c b 

    "I fear thee and thy glittering eye
      "And thy skinny hand so brown"--
    Fear not, fear not, thou wedding guest!
      This body dropt not down.

RHYME a b c b 

    Alone, alone, all all alone
      Alone on the wide wide Sea;
    And Christ would take no pity on
      My soul in agony.

RHYME a b c b 

    The many men so beautiful,
      And they all dead did lie!
    And a million million slimy things
      Liv'd on--and so did I.

RHYME a b c b 

    I look'd upon the rotting Sea,
      And drew my eyes away;
    I look'd upon the eldritch deck,
      And there the dead men lay.

RHYME a b c b 

    I look'd to Heaven, and try'd to pray;
      But or ever a prayer had gusht,
    A wicked whisper came and made
      My heart as dry as dust.

RHYME a b c c c 

    I clos'd my lids and kept them close,
      Till the balls like pulses beat;
    For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
    Lay like a load on my weary eye,
      And the dead were at my feet.

RHYME a b c b 

    The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
      Ne rot, ne reek did they;
    The look with which they look'd on me,
      Had never pass'd away.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
      A spirit from on high:
    But O! more horrible than that
      Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
    Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse
      And yet I could not die.

RHYME a b c b 

    The moving Moon went up the sky
      And no where did abide:
    Softly she was going up
      And a star or two beside--

RHYME a b c c b 

    Her beams bemock'd the sultry main
      Like morning frosts yspread;
    But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
    The charmed water burnt alway
      A still and awful red.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Beyond the shadow of the ship
      I watch'd the water-snakes:
    They mov'd in tracks of shining white;
    And when they rear'd, the elfish light
      Fell off in hoary flakes.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Within the shadow of the ship
      I watch'd their rich attire:
    Blue, glossy green, and velvet black
    They coil'd and swam; and every track
      Was a flash of golden fire.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    O happy living things! no tongue
      Their beauty might declare:
    A spring of love gusht from my heart,
      And I bless'd them unaware!
    Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
      And I bless'd them unaware.

RHYME a b c b 

    The self-same moment I could pray;
      And from my neck so free
    The Albatross fell off, and sank
      Like lead into the sea.

RHYME a b c c b 

    O sleep, it is a gentle thing
      Belov'd from pole to pole!
    To Mary-queen the praise be yeven
    She sent the gentle sleep from heaven
      That slid into my soul.

RHYME a b c b 

    The silly buckets on the deck
      That had so long remain'd,
    I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew
      And when I awoke it rain'd.

RHYME a b c b 

    My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
      My garments all were dank;
    Sure I had drunken in my dreams
      And still my body drank.

RHYME a b c b 

    I mov'd and could not feel my limbs,
      I was so light, almost
    I thought that I had died in sleep,
      And was a blessed Ghost.

RHYME a b c b 

    The roaring wind! it roar'd far off,
      It did not come anear;
    But with its sound it shook the sails
      That were so thin and sere.

RHYME a b c c b 

    The upper air bursts into life,
      And a hundred fire-flags sheen
    To and fro they are hurried about;
    And to and fro, and in and out
      The stars dance on between.

RHYME a b a b 

    The coming wind doth roar more loud;
      The sails do sigh, like sedge:
    The rain pours down from one black cloud
      And the Moon is at its edge.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Hark! hark! the thick black cloud is cleft,
      And the Moon is at its side:
    Like waters shot from some high crag,
    The lightning falls with never a jag
      A river steep and wide.

RHYME a b c b 

    The strong wind reach'd the ship: it roar'd
      And dropp'd down, like a stone!
    Beneath the lightning and the moon
      The dead men gave a groan.

RHYME a b c b 

    They groan'd, they stirr'd, they all uprose,
      Ne spake, ne mov'd their eyes:
    It had been strange, even in a dream
      To have seen those dead men rise.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The helmsman steerd, the ship mov'd on;
      Yet never a breeze up-blew;
    The Marineres all 'gan work the ropes,
      Where they were wont to do:
    They rais'd their limbs like lifeless tools--
      We were a ghastly crew.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The body of my brother's son
      Stood by me knee to knee:
    The body and I pull'd at one rope,
      But he said nought to me--
    And I quak'd to think of my own voice
      How frightful it would be!

RHYME a b c b 

    The day-light dawn'd--they dropp'd their arms,
      And cluster'd round the mast:
    Sweet sounds rose slowly thro' their mouths
      And from their bodies pass'd.

RHYME a b c b 

    Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
      Then darted to the sun:
    Slowly the sounds came back again
      Now mix'd, now one by one.

RHYME a b c c b 

    Sometimes a dropping from the sky
      I heard the Lavrock sing;
    Sometimes all little birds that are
    How they seem'd to fill the sea and air
      With their sweet jargoning,

RHYME a b c b 

    And now 'twas like all instruments,
      Now like a lonely flute;
    And now it is an angel's song
      That makes the heavens be mute.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    It ceas'd: yet still the sails made on
      A pleasant noise till noon,
    A noise like of a hidden brook
      In the leafy month of June,
    That to the sleeping woods all night
      Singeth a quiet tune.

RHYME a b c b 

    Listen, O listen, thou Wedding-guest!
      "Marinere! thou hast thy will:
    "For that, which comes out of thine eye, doth make
      "My body and soul to be still."

RHYME a b c b 

    Never sadder tale was told
      To a man of woman born:
    Sadder and wiser thou wedding-guest!
      Thou'lt rise to morrow morn.

RHYME a b c b 

    Never sadder tale was heard
      By a man of woman born:
    The Marineres all return'd to work
      As silent as beforne.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,
      But look at me they n'old:
    Thought I, I am as thin as air--
      They cannot me behold.

RHYME a b c b 

    Till moon we silently sail'd on
      Yet never a breeze did breathe:
    Slowly and smoothly went the ship
      Mov'd onward from beneath.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Under the keel nine fathom deep
      From the land of mist and snow
    The spirit slid: and it was He
      That made the Ship to go.
    The sails at noon left off their tune
      And the Ship stood still also.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    The sun right up above the mast
      Had fix'd her to the ocean:
    But in a minute she 'gan stir
      With a short uneasy motion--
    Backwards and forwards half her length
      With a short uneasy motion.

RHYME a b c b 

    Then, like a pawing horse let go,
      She made a sudden bound:
    It flung the blood into my head,
      And I fell into a swound.

RHYME a b c c b 

    How long in that same fit I lay,
      I have not to declare;
    But ere my living life return'd,
    I heard and in my soul discern'd
      Two voices in the air,

RHYME a b c b 

    "Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
      "By him who died on cross,
    "With his cruel bow he lay'd full low
      "The harmless Albatross.

RHYME a b c b 

    "The spirit who 'bideth by himself
      "In the land of mist and snow,
    "He lov'd the bird that lov'd the man
      "Who shot him with his bow."

RHYME a b c b 

    The other was a softer voice,
      As soft as honey-dew:
    Quoth he the man hath penance done,
      And penance more will do.

RHYME a b c b 

    "But tell me, tell me! speak again,
      "Thy soft response renewing--
    "What makes that ship drive on so fast?
      "What is the Ocean doing?"

RHYME a b c b 

    "Still as a Slave before his Lord,
      "The Ocean hath no blast:
    "His great bright eye most silently
      "Up to the moon is cast--

RHYME a b c b 

    "If he may know which way to go,
      "For she guides him smooth or grim.
    "See, brother, see! how graciously
      "She looketh down on him."

RHYME a b c b 

    "But why drives on that ship so fast
      "Withouten wave or wind?"
    "The air is cut away before,
      "And closes from behind.

RHYME a b c b 

    "Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high,
      "Or we shall be belated:
    "For slow and slow that ship will go,
      "When the Marinere's trance is abated."

RHYME a b c b 

    I woke, and we were sailing on
      As in a gentle weather:
    'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
      The dead men stood together.

RHYME a b c b 

    All stood together on the deck,
      For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
    All fix'd on me their stony eyes
      That in the moon did glitter.

RHYME a b c b 

    The pang, the curse, with which they died,
      Had never pass'd away:
    I could not draw my een from theirs
      Ne turn them up to pray.

RHYME a b c b 

    And in its time the spell was snapt,
      And I could move my een:
    I look'd far-forth, but little saw
      Of what might else be seen.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Like one, that on a lonely road
      Doth walk in fear and dread,
    And having once turn'd round, walks on
      And turns no more his head:
    Because he knows, a frightful fiend
      Doth close behind him tread.

RHYME a b c b 

    But soon there breath'd a wind on me,
      Ne sound ne motion made:
    Its path was not upon the sea
      In ripple or in shade.

RHYME a b c b 

    It rais'd my hair, it fann'd my cheek,
      Like a meadow-gale of spring--
    It mingled strangely with my fears,
      Yet it felt like a welcoming.

RHYME a b c b 

    Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,
      Yet she sail'd softly too:
    Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--
      On me alone it blew.

RHYME a b c b 

    O dream of joy! is this indeed
      The light-house top I see?
    Is this the Hill? Is this the Kirk?
      Is this mine own countree?

RHYME a b c b 

    We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,
      And I with sobs did pray--
    "O let me be awake, my God!
      "Or let me sleep alway!"

RHYME a b c b 

    The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
      So smoothly it was strewn!
    And on the bay the moon light lay,
      And the shadow of the moon.

RHYME a b c b 

    The moonlight bay was white all o'er,
      Till rising from the same,
    Full many shapes, that shadows were,
      Like as of torches came.

RHYME a b c b 

    A little distance from the prow
      Those dark-red shadows were;
    But soon I saw that my own flesh
      Was red as in a glare.

RHYME a b c b 

    I turn'd my head in fear and dread,
      And by the holy rood,
    The bodies had advanc'd, and now
      Before the mast they stood.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    They lifted up their stiff right arms,
      They held them strait and tight;
    And each right-arm burnt like a torch,
      A torch that's borne upright.
    Their stony eye-balls glitter'd on
      In the red and smoky light.

RHYME a b a b 

    I pray'd and turn'd my head away
      Forth looking as before.
    There was no breeze upon the bay,
      No wave against the shore.

RHYME a b a b 

    The rock shone bright, the kirk no less
      That stands above the rock:
    The moonlight steep'd in silentness
      The steady weathercock.

RHYME a b c b 

    And the bay was white with silent light,
      Till rising from the same
    Full many shapes, that shadows were,
      In crimson colours came.

RHYME a b c b 

    A little distance from the prow
      Those crimson shadows were:
    I turn'd my eyes upon the deck--
      O Christ! what saw I there?

RHYME a b c b 

    Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat;
      And by the Holy rood
    A man all light, a seraph-man,
      On every corse there stood.

RHYME a b c b 

    This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand:
      It was a heavenly sight:
    They stood as signals to the land,
      Each one a lovely light:

RHYME a b c b 

    This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand,
      No voice did they impart--
    No voice; but O! the silence sank,
      Like music on my heart.

RHYME a b c b 

    Eftsones I heard the dash of oars,
      I heard the pilot's cheer:
    My head was turn'd perforce away
      And I saw a boat appear.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    Then vanish'd all the lovely lights;
      The bodies rose anew:
    With silent pace, each to his place,
      Came back the ghastly crew.
    The wind, that shade nor motion made,
      On me alone it blew.

RHYME a b a b 

    The pilot, and the pilot's boy
      I heard them coming fast:
    Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy,
      The dead men could not blast.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    I saw a third--I heard his voice:
      It is the Hermit good!
    He singeth loud his godly hymns
      That he makes in the wood.
    He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away
      The Albatross's blood.

RHYME a b c c b 

    This Hermit good lives in that wood
      Which slopes down to the Sea.
    How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
    He loves to talk with Marineres
      That come from a far Contree.

RHYME a b c b 

    He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
      He hath a cushion plump:
    It is the moss, that wholly hides
      The rotted old Oak-stump.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Skiff-boat ne'rd: I heard them talk,
      "Why, this is strange, I trow!
    "Where are those lights so many and fair
      "That signal made but now?

RHYME a b c b d b 

    "Strange, by my faith!" the Hermit said--
      "And they answer'd not our cheer.
    "The planks look warp'd, and see those sails
      "How thin they are and sere!
    "I never saw aught like to them
      "Unless perchance it were

RHYME a b c c b 

    "The skeletons of leaves that lag
      "My forest brook along:
    "When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,
    "And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below
      "That eats the she-wolf's young.

RHYME a b c b 

    "Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look"--
      (The Pilot made reply)
    "I am a-fear'd.--"Push on, push on!"
      Said the Hermit cheerily.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Boat came closer to the Ship,
      But I ne spake ne stirr'd!
    The Boat came close beneath the Ship,
      And strait a sound was heard!

RHYME a b c b 

    Under the water it rumbled on,
      Still louder and more dread:
    It reach'd the Ship, it split the bay;
      The Ship went down like lead.

RHYME a b a b a b 

    Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,
      Which sky and ocean smote:
    Like one that hath been seven days drown'd
      My body lay afloat:
    But, swift as dreams, myself I found
      Within the Pilot's boat.

RHYME a b c b 

    Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,
      The boat spun round and round:
    And all was still, save that the hill
      Was telling of the sound.

RHYME a b c b 

    I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd
      And fell down in a fit.
    The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes
      And pray'd where he did sit.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
      Who now doth crazy go,
    Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while
      His eyes went to and fro,
    "Ha! ha!" quoth he--"full plain I see,
      "The devil knows how to row."

RHYME a b c b 

    And now all in mine own Countree
      I stood on the firm land!
    The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat,
      And scarcely he could stand.

RHYME a b c b 

    "O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!"
      The Hermit cross'd his brow--
    "Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say
      "What manner man art thou?"

RHYME a b c b 

    Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
      With a woeful agony,
    Which forc'd me to begin my tale
      And then it left me free.

RHYME a b c b 

    Since then at an uncertain hour,
      Now oftimes and now fewer,
    That anguish comes and makes me tell
      My ghastly aventure.

RHYME a b c c b 

    I pass, like night, from land to land;
      I have strange power of speech;
    The moment that his face I see
      I know the man that must hear me;
      To him my tale I teach.

RHYME a b c b d b 

    What loud uproar bursts from that door!
      The Wedding-guests are there;
    But in the Garden-bower the Bride
      And Bride-maids singing are:
    And hark the little Vesper-bell
      Which biddeth me to prayer.

RHYME a b c b 

    O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been
      Alone on a wide wide sea:
    So lonely 'twas, that God himself
      Scarce seemed there to be.

RHYME a b c b 

    O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,
      'Tis sweeter far to me
    To walk together to the Kirk
      With a goodly company.

RHYME a b c c b 

    To walk together to the Kirk
      And all together pray,
    While each to his great father bends,
    Old men, and babes, and loving friends,
      And Youths, and Maidens gay.

RHYME a b a b 

    Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
      To thee, thou wedding-guest!
    He prayeth well who loveth well
      Both man and bird and beast.

RHYME a b c b 

    He prayeth best who loveth best,
      All things both great and small:
    For the dear God, who loveth us,
      He made and loveth all.

RHYME a b c b 

    The Marinere, whose eye is bright,
      Whose beard with age is hoar,
    Is gone; and now the wedding-guest
      Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.

RHYME a b c b 

    He went, like one that hath been stunn'd
      And is of sense forlorn:
    A sadder and a wiser man
      He rose the morrow morn.

TITLE Kubla Khan

RHYME a b a a b

IN Xanadu did Kubla Khan	
  A stately pleasure-dome decree:	
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran	
Through caverns measureless to man	
  Down to a sunless sea.	     

RHYME a a b c b c

So twice five miles of fertile ground	
With walls and towers were girdled round:	
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,	
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree	
And here were forests ancient as the hills,	  
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.	

RHYME a b a a b
 
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted	
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!	
A savage place! as holy and enchanted	
As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted	  
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!	

RHYME a a b b c c d d

And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething	
As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,	
A mighty fountain momently was forced;	
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst	  
Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,	
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:	
And ’mid these dancing rocks at once and ever	
It flung up momently the sacred river.	

RHYME a b b a c c

Five miles meandering with a mazy motion	  
Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,	
Then reached the caverns measureless to man,	
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:	
And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far	
Ancestral voices prophesying war!	  
 
RHYME a b a b c c

    The shadow of the dome of pleasure	
      Floated midway on the waves;	
    Where was heard the mingled measure	
      From the fountain and the caves.	
It was a miracle of rare device,	  
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!	
 
RHYME a a b b a 

    A damsel with a dulcimer	
      In a vision once I saw:	
    It was an Abyssinian maid,	
      And on her dulcimer she played,	  
    Singing of Mount Abora.

RHYME a b a b c d c c c d e e d
	
    Could I revive within me	
    Her symphony and song,	
To such a deep delight ’twould win me,	
That with music loud and long,	  
I would build that done in air,	
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!	
And all who heard should see them there,	
And all should cry, Beware! Beware!	
His flashing eyes, his floating hair!	  
Weave a circle round him thrice,	
    And close your eyes with holy dread,	
    For he on honey-dew hath fed,	
And drunk the milk of Paradise.

TITLE UNTO HER MAJESTY'S SACRED HONOURABLE MAIDS

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Eternal Twins! that conquer death and time,
      Perpetual advocates in heaven and earth!
      Fair, chaste, immaculate, and all divine,
      Glorious alone, before the first man's birth;
    Your twofold charities, celestial lights,
      Bow your sun-rising eyes, planets of joy,
      Upon these orphan poems; in whose rights
      Conceit first claimed his birthright to enjoy.
    If, pitiful, you shun the song of death,
      Or fear the stain of love's life-dropping blood,
      O know then, you are pure; and purer faith
      Shall still keep white the flower, the fruit, and bud.
    Love moveth all things. You that love, shall move
    All things in him, and he in you shall love.

TITLE TO HIS MISTRESS

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Grace full of grace, though in these verses here
      My love complains of others than of thee,
      Yet thee alone I loved, and they by me,
    Thou yet unknown, only mistaken were.
    Like him which feels a heat now here now there,
      Blames now this cause now that, until he see
      The fire indeed from whence they caused be;
    Which fire I now do know is you, my dear,
    Thus diverse loves dispersed in my verse
      In thee alone for ever I unite,
    And fully unto thee more to rehearse;
      To him I fly for grace that rules above,
    That by my grace I may live in delight,
      Or by his grace I never more may love.

TITLE TO HIS ABSENT DIANA

RHYME a b b a a c c a d e d e f f

    Severed from sweet content, my live's sole light,
      Banished by over-weening wit from my desire,
      This poor acceptance only I require:
    That though my fault have forced me from thy sight
    Yet that thou would'st, my sorrows to requite,
      Review these sonnets, pictures of thy praise;
      Wherein each woe thy wondrous worth doth raise,
    Though first thy worth bereft me of delight.
      See them forsaken; for I them forsook,
    Forsaken first of thee, next of my sense;
      And when thou deign'st on their black tears to look,
    Shed not one tear, my tears to recompence;
      But joy in this, though fate 'gainst me repine,
      My verse still lives to witness thee divine.

TITLE The First Decade

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Resolved to love, unworthy to obtain,
      I do no favour crave; but, humble wise,
      To thee my sighs in verse I sacrifice,
    Only some pity and no help to gain.
    Hear then, and as my heart shall aye remain
      A patient object to thy lightning eyes,
      A patient ear bring thou to thund'ring cries;
    Fear not the crack, when I the blow sustain.
      So as thine eye bred mine ambitious thought,
    So shall thine ear make proud my voice for joy.
      Lo, dear, what wonders great by thee are wrought,
    When I but little favour do enjoy!
      The voice is made the ear for to rejoice,
      And your ear giveth pleasure to my voice.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Blame not my heart for flying up so high,
      Sith thou art cause that it this flight begun;
      For earthly vapours drawn up by the sun,
    Comets become, and night suns in the sky.
    Mine humble heart, so with thy heavenly eye
      Drawn up aloft, all low desires doth shun;
      Raise thou me up, as thou my heart hast done,
    So during night in heaven remain may I.
      I say again, blame not my high desire,
    Sith of us both the cause thereof depends.
      In thee doth shine, in me doth burn a fire,
    Fire draws up other, and itself ascends.
      Thine eye a fire, and so draws up my love;
      My love a fire, and so ascends above.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Fly low, dear love, thy sun dost thou not see?
      Take heed, do not so near his rays aspire;
      Lest, for thy pride, inflamed with wreakful ire,
    It burn thy wings, as it hath burned me.
    Thou haply sayst thy wings immortal be,
      And so cannot consumed be with fire;
      And one is hope, the other is desire,
    And that the heavens bestowed them both on thee.
      A muse's words made thee with hope to fly,
    An angel's face desire hath begot,
      Thyself engendered by a goddess' eye;
    Yet for all this, immortal thou art not.
      Of heavenly eye though thou begotten art,
      Yet art thou born but of a mortal heart.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    A friend of mine, pitying my hopeless love,
      Hoping by killing hope my love to stay,
      "Let not," quoth he, "thy hope, thy heart betray;
    Impossible it is her heart to move."
    But sith resolved love cannot remove
      As long as thy divine perfections stay,
      Thy godhead then he sought to take away.
    Dear, seek revenge and him a liar prove;
      Gods only do impossibilities.
    "Impossible," saith he, "thy grace to gain."
      Show then the power of divinities
    By granting me thy favour to obtain.
      So shall thy foe give to himself the lie;
      A goddess thou shall prove, and happy I!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Thine eye the glass where I behold my heart,
      Mine eye the window through the which thine eye
      May see my heart, and there thyself espy
    In bloody colours how thou painted art.
    Thine eye the pile is of a murdering dart;
      Mine eye the sight thou tak'st thy level by
      To hit my heart, and never shoot'st awry.
    Mine eye thus helps thine eye to work my smart.
      Thine eye a fire is both in heat and light;
    Mine eye of tears a river doth become.
      O that the water of mine eye had might
    To quench the flames that from thine eye doth come,
      Or that the fires kindled by thine eye,
      The flowing streams of mine eyes could make dry.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Mine eye with all the deadly sins is fraught.
      First _proud_, sith it presumed to look so high.
      A watchman being made, stood gazing by,
    And _idle_, took no heed till I was caught.
    And _envious_, bears envy that by thought
      Should in his absence be to her so nigh.
      To kill my heart, mine eye let in her eye;
    And so consent gave to a _murder_ wrought.
      And _covetous_, it never would remove
    From her fair hair, gold so doth please his sight.
      _Unchaste_, a baud between my heart and love.
    A _glutton_ eye, with tears drunk every night.
      These sins procured have a goddess' ire,
      Wherefore my heart is damned in love's sweet fire.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Falsely doth envy of your praises blame
      My tongue, my pen, my heart of flattery,
      Because I said there was no sun but thee.
    It called my tongue the partial trump of fame,
    And saith my pen hath flattered thy name,
      Because my pen did to my tongue agree;
      And that my heart must needs a flatterer be,
    Which taught both tongue and pen to say the same.
      No, no, I flatter not when thee I call
    The sun, sith that the sun was never such;
      But when the sun thee I compared withal,
    Doubtless the sun I flattered too much.
      Witness mine eyes, I say the truth in this,
      They have seen thee and know that so it is.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Much sorrow in itself my love doth move,
      More my despair to love a hopeless bliss,
      My folly most to love whom sure to miss
    O help me, but this last grief to remove;
    All pains, if you command, it joy shall prove,
      And wisdom to seek joy. Then say but this,
      "Because my pleasure in thy torment is,
    I do command thee without hope to love!"
      So when this thought my sorrow shall augment
    That my own folly did procure my pain,
      Then shall I say to give myself content,
    "Obedience only made me love in vain.
      It was your will, and not my want of wit;
      I have the pain, bear you the blame of it!"

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    My lady's presence makes the roses red,
      Because to see her lips they blush with shame.
      The lily's leaves for envy pale became,
    And her white hands in them this envy bred.
    The marigold the leaves abroad doth spread,
      Because the sun's and her power is the same.
      The violet of purple colour came,
    Dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed.
      In brief, all flowers from her their virtue take;
    From her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed;
      The living heat which her eyebeams doth make
    Warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed.
      The rain wherewith she watereth the flowers,
      Falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Heralds at arms do three perfections quote,
      To wit, most fair, most rich, most glittering;
      So when those three concur within one thing,
    Needs must that thing of honour be a note.
    Lately I did behold a rich fair coat,
      Which wished fortune to mine eyes did bring.
      A lordly coat, yet worthy of a king,
    In which one might all these perfections note.
      A field of lilies, roses proper bare;
    Two stars in chief; the crest was waves of gold.
      How glittering 'twas, might by the stars appear;
    The lilies made it fair for to behold.
      And rich it was as by the gold appeareth;
      But happy he that in his arms it weareth!

TITLE The Second Decade

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    If true love might true love's reward obtain,
      Dumb wonder only might speak of my joy;
      But too much worth hath made thee too much coy,
    And told me long ago I sighed in vain.
    Not then vain hope of undeserved gain
      Hath made me paint in verses mine annoy,
      But for thy pleasure, that thou might'st enjoy
    Thy beauty's praise, in glasses of my pain.
      See then, thyself, though me thou wilt not hear,
    By looking on my verse. For pain in verse,
      Love doth in pain, beauty in love appear.
        So if thou would'st my verses' meaning see,
    Expound them thus, when I my love rehearse:
      "None loves like he!" that is, "None fair like me!"

RHYME a b b a a b b a c c d e d e

    It may be, love my death doth not pretend,
      Although he shoots at me, but thinks it fit
      Thus to bewitch thee for thy benefit,
    Causing thy will to my wish to condescend.
    For witches which some murder do intend,
      Do make a picture and do shoot at it;
      And in that part where they the picture hit,
    The party's self doth languish to his end.
      So love, too weak by force thy heart to taint,
      Within my heart thy heavenly shape doth paint;
    Suffering therein his arrows to abide,
      Only to th'end he might by witches' art,
    Within my heart pierce through thy picture's side,
      And through thy picture's side might wound my heart.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    The sun, his journey ending in the west,
      Taketh his lodging up in Thetis' bed;
      Though from our eyes his beams be banished,
    Yet with his light th' antipodes be blest.
    Now when the sun-time brings my sun to rest,
      Which me too oft of rest hath hindered,
      And whiter skin with white sheet covered,
    And softer cheek doth on soft pillow rest,
      Then I, O sun of suns! and light of lights!
    Wish me with those antipodes to be,
      Which see and feel thy beams and heat by nights.
        Well, though the night both cold and darksome is,
    Yet half the day's delight the night grants me,
        I feel my sun's heat, though his light I miss.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Lady, in beauty and in favour rare,
      Of favour, not of due, I favour crave.
      Nature to thee beauty and favour gave;
    Fair then thou art, and favour thou may'st spare.
    Nor when on me bestowed your favours are,
      Less favour in your face you shall not have;
      If favour then a wounded soul may save,
    Of murder's guilt, dear Lady, then beware.
      My loss of life a million fold were less
    Than the least loss should unto you befall;
      Yet grant this gift; which gift when I possess,
      Both I have life and you no loss at all.
        For by your favour only I do live,
        And favour you may well both keep and give.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    My reason absent did mine eyes require
      To watch and ward and such foes to descry
      As they should ne'er my heart approaching spy;
    But traitor eyes my heart's death did conspire,
    Corrupted with hope's gifts; let in desire
      To burn my heart; and sought no remedy,
      Though store of water were in either eye,
    Which well employed, might well have quenched the fire.
      Reason returned; love and fortune made
    Judges, to judge mine eyes to punishment.
      Fortune, sith they by sight my heart betrayed
    From wished sight, adjudged them banishment;
      Love, sith by fire murdered my heart was found,
      Adjudged them in tears for to be drowned.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Wonder it is and pity is't that she
      In whom all beauty's treasure we may find,
      That may unrich the body and the mind,
    Towards the poor should use no charity.
    My love has gone a begging unto thee.
      And if that beauty had not been more kind
      That pity, long ere this he had been pined;
      But beauty is content his food to be.
      O pity have when such poor orphans beg!
    Love, naked boy, hath nothing on his back;
      And though he wanteth neither arm nor leg,
    Yet maimed he is sith he his sight doth lack.
      And yet though blind he beauty can behold,
      And yet though naked he feels more heat than cold.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Pity refusing my poor love to feed,
      A beggar starved for want of help he lies;
      And at your mouth, the door of beauty, cries,
    That thence some alms of sweet grants might proceed.
    But as he waiteth for some almes deed,
      A cherry tree before the door he spies.
      "O dear," quoth he, "two cherries may suffice.
    Two only may save life in this my need."
      But beggars, can they nought but cherries eat?
    Pardon my love, he is a goddess' son,
      And never feedeth but on dainty meat,
    Else need he not to pine, as he hath done;
      For only the sweet fruit of this sweet tree
      Can give food to my love and life to me.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    The fowler hides as closely as he may
      The net, where caught the silly bird should be,
      Lest he the threatening poison should but see,
    And so for fear be forced to fly away.
    My lady so, the while she doth assay
      In curled knots fast to entangle me,
      Put on her veil, to th' end I should not flee
    The golden net wherein I am a prey.
      Alas, most sweet! what need is of a net
    To catch a bird that is already ta'en?
      Sith with your hand alone you may it get,
    For it desires to fly into the same.
        What needs such art my thoughts then to entrap,
        When of themselves they fly into your lap?

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Sweet hand, the sweet but cruel bow thou art,
      From whence at me five ivory arrows fly;
      So with five wounds at once I wounded lie,
    Bearing my breast the print of every dart.
    Saint Francis had the like, yet felt no smart,
      Where I in living torments never die.
      His wounds were in his hands and feet; where I
    All these five helpless wounds feel in my heart.
      Now, as Saint Francis, if a saint am I,
    The bow that shot these shafts a relic is;
      I mean the hand, which is the reason why
    So many for devotion thee would kiss:
        And some thy glove kiss as a thing divine,
        This arrows' quiver, and this relic's shrine.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c c d e d e

    Fair sun, if you would have me praise your light,
      When night approacheth wherefore do you fly?
      Time is so short, beauties so many be,
    As I have need to see them day and night,
    That by continual view my verses might
      Tell all the beams of your divinity;
      Which praise to you and joy should be to me,
    You living by my verse, I by your sight;
      I by your sight, and not you by my verse,
      Need mortal skill immortal praise rehearse?
    No, no, though eyes were blind, and verse were dumb,
      Your beauty should be seen and your fame known;
    For by the wind which from my sighs do come,
        Your praises round about the world are blown.

    Uncivil sickness, hast thou no regard,
      But dost presume my dearest to molest,
      And without leave dar'st enter in that breast
    Whereto sweet love approach yet never dared?
    Spare thou her health, which my life hath not spared;
      Too bitter such revenge of my unrest!
      Although with wrongs my thought she hath opprest,
    My wrongs seek not revenge, they crave reward
      Cease, sickness, cease in her then to remain;
    And come and welcome, harbour thou in me
      Whom love long since hath taught to suffer in!
        So she which hath so oft my pain increased,
    O God, that I might so revenged be,
        By my poor pain might have her pain released!

RHYME a b a b b c b c c d c d e e

    Woe to mine eyes, the organs of mine ill;
      Hate to my heart, for not concealing joy;
      A double curse upon my tongue be still,
      Whose babbling lost what else I might enjoy!
    When first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy,
      They to my heart thy wondrous virtues told;
      Who, fearing lest thy beams should him destroy,
      Whate'er he knew, did to my tongue unfold.
    My tell-tale tongue, in talking over bold,
      What they in private council did declare,
      To thee, in plain and public terms unrolled;
      And so by that made thee more coyer far.
    What in thy praise he spoke, that didst thou trust;
    And yet my sorrows thou dost hold unjust.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Of an Athenian young man have I read,
      Who on blind fortune's picture doated so,
      That when he could not buy it to his bed,
      On it he gazing died for very woe.
    My fortune's picture art thou, flinty dame,
      That settest golden apples to my sight;
      But wilt by no means let me taste the same.
      To drown in sight of land is double spite.
    Of fortune as thou learn'dst to be unkind,
      So learn to be unconstant to disdain.
      The wittiest women are to sport inclined.
      Honour is pride, and pride is nought but pain.
    Let others boast of choosing for the best;
    'Tis substances not names must make us blest.

TITLE The Fourth Decade

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Needs must I leave and yet needs must I love;
      In vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe;
      Despair in me, disdain in thee, doth show
    How by my wit I do my folly prove.
    All this my heart from love can never move.
      Love is not in my heart. No, Lady, no,
      My heart is love itself. Till I forego
    My heart I never can my love remove.
      How can I then leave love? I do intend
      Not to crave grace, but yet to wish it still;
      Not to praise thee, but beauty to commend;
    And so, by beauty's praise, praise thee I will;
        For as my heart is love, love not in me,
        So beauty thou, beauty is not in thee.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Sweet sovereign, since so many minds remain
      Obedient subjects at thy beauty's call,
      So many hearts bound in thy hairs as thrall,
    So many eyes die with one look's disdain,
    Go, seek the honour that doth thee pertain,
      That the Fifth Monarchy may thee befall!
      Thou hast such means to conquer men withal,
    As all the world must yield or else be slain.
      To fight, thou need'st no weapons but thine eyes,
    Thine hair hath gold enough to pay thy men,
      And for their food thy beauty will suffice;
        For men and armour, Lady, care have none;
    For one will sooner yield unto thee then
        When he shall meet thee naked all alone.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    When your perfections to my thoughts appear,
      They say among themselves, "O happy we,
      Whichever shall so rare an object see!"
    But happy heart, if thoughts less happy were!
    For their delights have cost my heart full dear,
      In whom of love a thousand causes be,
      And each cause breeds a thousand loves in me,
    And each love more than thousand hearts can bear.
      How can my heart so many loves then hold,
    Which yet by heaps increase from day to day?
      But like a ship that's o'ercharged with gold,
    Must either sink or hurl the gold away.
        But hurl not love; thou canst not, feeble heart;
        In thine own blood, thou therefore drowned art!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fools be they that inveigh 'gainst Mahomet,
      Who's but a moral of love's monarchy.
      But a dull adamant, as straw by jet,
      He in an iron chest was drawn on high.
    In midst of Mecca's temple roof, some say,
      He now hangs without touch or stay at all.
      That Mahomet is she to whom I pray;
      May ne'er man pray so ineffectual!
    Mine eyes, love's strange exhaling adamants,
      Un'wares, to my heart's temple's height have wrought
      The iron idol that compassion wants,
      Who my oft tears and travails sets at nought.
    Iron hath been transformed to gold by art;
    Her face, limbs, flesh and all, gold; save her heart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Ready to seek out death in my disgrace,
      My mistress 'gan to smooth her gathered brows,
      Whereby I am reprieved for a space.
      O hope and fear! who half your torments knows?
    It is some mercy in a black-mouthed judge
      To haste his prisoner's end, if he must die.
      Dear, if all other favour you shall grudge,
      Do speedy execution with your eye;
    With one sole look you leave in me no soul!
      Count it a loss to lose a faithful slave.
      Would God, that I might hear my last bell toll,
      So in your bosom I might dig a grave!
    Doubtful delay is worse than any fever,
    Or help me soon, or cast me off for ever!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Each day, new proofs of new despair I find,
      That is, new deaths. No marvel then, though I
      Make exile my last help; to th'end mine eye
    Should not behold the death to me assigned.
    Not that from death absence might save my mind,
      But that it might take death more patiently;
      Like him, the which by judge condemned to die,
    To suffer with more ease, his eyes doth blind.
      Your lips in scarlet clad, my judges be,
    Pronouncing sentence of eternal "No!"
      Despair, the hangman that tormenteth me;
        The death I suffer is the life I have.
    For only life doth make me die in woe,
    And only death I for my pardon crave.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    The richest relic Rome did ever view
      Was' Caesar's tomb; on which, with cunning hand,
      Jove's triple honours, the three fair Graces, stand,
    Telling his virtues in their virtues true.
    This Rome admired; but dearest dear, in you
      Dwelleth the wonder of the happiest land,
      And all the world to Neptune's furthest strand,
    For what Rome shaped hath living life in you.
      Thy naked beauty, bounteously displayed,
    Enricheth monarchies of hearts with love;
      Thine eyes to hear complaints are open laid;
      Thine eyes' kind looks requite all pains I prove;
        That of my death I dare not thee accuse;
        But pride in me that baser chance refuse.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Why thus unjustly, say, my cruel fate,
      Dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart,
      The one to live exiled from that sweet smart,
    Where th' other pines, imprisoned without date?
    My luckless eyes must never more debate
      Of those bright beams that eased my love apart;
      And yet my heart, bound to them with love's dart,
    Must there dwell ever to bemoan my state.
      O had mine eyes been suffered there to rest,
    Often they had my heart's unquiet eased;
      Or had my heart with banishment been blest,
    Mine eye with beauty never had been pleased!
      But since these cross effects hath fortune wrought,
      Dwell, heart, with her; eyes, view her in my thought!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Hope, like the hyaena, coming to be old,
      Alters his shape, is turned into despair.
      Pity my hoary hopes, Maid of clear mould!
      Think not that frowns can ever make thee fair.
    What harm is it to kiss, to laugh, to play?
      Beauty's no blossom, if it be not used.
      Sweet dalliance keeps the wrinkles long away;
      Repentance follows them that have refused.
    To bring you to the knowledge of your good,
      I seek, I sue. O try and then believe!
      Each image can be chaste that's carved of wood.
      You show you live, when men you do relieve.
    Iron with wearing shines; rust wasteth treasure.
    On earth but love there is no other pleasure.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Ay me, poor wretch, my prayer is turned to sin!
      I say, "I love!" My mistress says "'Tis lust!"
      Thus most we lose where most we seek to win.
      Wit will make wicked what is ne'er so just.
    And yet I can supplant her false surmise.
      Lust is a fire that for an hour or twain
      Giveth a scorching blaze and then he dies;
      Love a continual furnace doth maintain.
    A furnace! Well, this a furnace may be called;
      For it burns inward, yields a smothering flame,
      Sighs which, like boiled lead's smoking vapour, scald.
      I sigh apace at echo of sighs' name.
    Long have I served; no short blaze is my love.
    Hid joys there are that maids scorn till they prove.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I do not now complain of my disgrace,
      O cruel fair one! fair with cruel crost;
      Nor of the hour, season, time, nor place;
      Nor of my foil, for any freedom lost;
    Nor of my courage, by misfortune daunted;
      Nor of my wit, by overweening struck;
      Nor of my sense, by any sound enchanted;
      Nor of the force of fiery-pointed hook;
    Nor of the steel that sticks within my wound;
      Nor of my thoughts, by worser thoughts defaced;
      Nor of the life I labour to confound.
      But I complain, that being thus disgraced,
    Fired, feared, frantic, fettered, shot through, slain,
    My death is such as I may not complain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    If ever sorrow spoke from soul that loves,
      As speaks a spirit in a man possest,
      In me her spirit speaks. My soul it moves,
      Whose sigh-swoll'n words breed whirlwinds in my breast;
    Or like the echo of a passing bell,
      Which sounding on the water seems to howl;
      So rings my heart a fearful heavy knell,
      And keeps all night in consort with the owl.
    My cheeks with a thin ice of tears are clad,
      Mine eyes like morning stars are bleared and red.
      What resteth then but I be raging mad,
      To see that she, my cares' chief conduit-head,
    When all streams else help quench my burning heart,
    Shuts up her springs and will no grace impart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    You secret vales, you solitary fields,
      You shores forsaken and you sounding rocks!
      If ever groaning heart hath made you yield,
      Or words half spoke that sense in prison locks,
    Then 'mongst night shadows whisper out my death.
      That when myself hath sealed my lips from speaking,
      Each tell-tale echo with a weeping breath,
      May both record my truth and true love's breaking.
    You pretty flowers that smile for summer's sake,
      Pull in your heads before my wat'ry eyes
      Do turn the meadows to a standing lake,
      By whose untimely floods your glory dies!
    For lo, mine heart, resolved to moistening air,
    Feedeth mine eyes which double tear for tear.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d c d

    His shadow to Narcissus well presented,
      How fair he was by such attractive love!
      So if thou would'st thyself thy beauty prove,
    Vulgar breath-mirrors might have well contented,
    And to their prayers eternally consented,
      Oaths, vows and sighs, if they believe might move;
      But more thou forc'st, making my pen approve
    Thy praise to all, least any had dissented.
      When this hath wrought, thou which before wert known
    But unto some, of all art now required,
      And thine eyes' wonders wronged, because not shown
    The world, with daily orisons desired.
      Thy chaste fair gifts, with learning's breath is blown,
    And thus my pen hath made thy sweets admired.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I am no model figure, or sign of care,
      But his eternal heart's-consuming essence,
      In whom grief's commentaries written are,
      Drawing gross passion into pure quintessence,
    Not thine eye's fire, but fire of thine eye's disdain,
      Fed by neglect of my continual grieving,
      Attracts the true life's spirit of my pain,
      And gives it thee, which gives me no relieving.
    Within thine arms sad elegies I sing;
      Unto thine eyes a true heart love-torn lay I:
      Thou smell'st from me the savours sorrows bring;
      My tears to taste my truth to touch display I.
    Lo thus each sense, dear fair one, I importune;
    But being care, thou flyest me as ill fortune.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    But being care, thou flyest me as ill fortune;--
      Care the consuming canker of the mind!
      The discord that disorders sweet hearts' tune!
      Th' abortive bastard of a coward mind!
    The lightfoot lackey that runs post by death,
      Bearing the letters which contain our end!
      The busy advocate that sells his breath,
      Denouncing worst to him, is most his friend!
    O dear, this care no interest holds in me;
      But holy care, the guardian of thy fair,
      Thine honour's champion, and thy virtue's fee,
      The zeal which thee from barbarous times shall bear,
    This care am I; this care my life hath taken.
    Dear to my soul, then leave me not forsaken!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Dear to my soul, then, leave, me not forsaken!
      Fly not! My heart within thy bosom sleepeth;
      Even from myself and sense I have betaken
      Me unto thee for whom my spirit weepeth,
    And on the shore of that salt teary sea,
      Couched in a bed of unseen seeming pleasure,
      Where in imaginary thoughts thy fair self lay;
      But being waked, robbed of my life's best treasure,
    I call the heavens, air, earth, and seas to hear
    My love, my truth, and black disdained estate,
      Beating the rocks with bellowings of despair,
      Which still with plaints my words reverberate,
    Sighing, "Alas, what shall become of me?"
    Whilst echo cries, "What shall become of me?"

    Prometheus for stealing living fire
      From heaven's king, was judged eternal death;
      In self-same flame with unrelenting ire
      Bound fast to Caucasus' low foot beneath.
    So I, for stealing living beauty's fire
      Into my verse that it may always live,
      And change his forms to shapes of my desire,
      Thou beauty's queen, self sentence like dost give.
    Bound to thy feet in chains of life I lie;
      For to thine eyes I never dare aspire;
      And in thy beauty's brightness do I fry,
      As poor Prometheus in the scalding fire;
    Which tears maintain as oil the lamp revives;
    Only my succour in thy favour lies.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    One sun unto my life's day gives true light.
      One moon dissolves my stormy night of woes.
      One star my fate and happy fortune shows.
    One saint I serve, one shrine with vows I dight.
    One sun transfix'd hath burnt my heart outright,
      One moon opposed my love in darkness throws.
      One star hath bid my thoughts my wrongs disclose.
    Saints scorn poor swains, shrines do my vows no right.
      Yet if my love be found a holy fire,
    Pure, unstained, without idolatry,
      And she nathless in hate of my desire,
    Lives to repose her in my misery,
      My sun, my moon, my star, my saint, my shrine,
      Mine be the torment but the guilt be thine!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    To live in hell, and heaven to behold;
      To welcome life, and die a living death;
      To sweat with heat, and yet be freezing cold;
      To grasp at stars, and lie the earth beneath;
    To treat a maze that never shall have end;
      To burn in sighs, and starve in daily tears;
      To climb a hill, and never to descend;
      Giants to kill, and quake at childish fears;
    To pine for food, and watch th' Hesperian tree;
      To thirst for drink, and nectar still to draw;
      To live accurs'd whom men hold blest to be,
      And weep those wrongs which never creature saw:
    If this be love, if love in these be founded,
    My heart is love, for these in it are grounded.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    A carver, having loved too long in vain,
      Hewed out the portraiture of Venus' son
      In marble rock, upon the which did rain
      Small drizzling drops, that from a fount did run:
    Imagining the drops would either wear
      His fury out, or quench his living flame;
      But when he saw it bootless did appear,
      He swore the water did augment the same.
    So I, that seek in verse to carve thee out,
      Hoping thy beauty will my flame allay,
      Viewing my verse and poems all throughout,
      Find my will rather to my love obey,
    That with the carver I my work do blame,
    Finding it still th' augmenter of my flame.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Astronomers the heavens do divide
      Into eight houses, where the god remains;
      All which in thy perfections do abide.
      For in thy feet, the queen of silence reigns;
    About thy waist Jove's messenger doth dwell,
      Inchanting me as I thereat admire;
      And on thy dugs the queen of love doth tell
      Her godhead's power in scrolls of my desire;
    Thy beauty is the world's eternal sun;
      Thy favours force a coward's heart to dare,
      And in thy hairs Jove and his riches won.
      Thy frowns hold Saturn; thine's the fixed stars.
    Pardon me then, divine, to love thee well,
    Since thou art heaven, and I in heaven would dwell!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Weary of love, my thoughts of love complained,
      Till reason told them there was no such power,
      And bade me view fair beauty's richest flower,
    To see if there a naked boy remained.
    Dear, to thine eyes, eyes that my soul hath pained,
      Thoughts turned them back in that unhappy hour
      To see if love kept there his royal bower,
    For if not there, then no place him contained.
      There was he not, nor boy, nor golden bow;
    Yet as thou turned thy chaste fair eye aside,
      A flame of fire did from thine eyelids go,
    Which burnt my heart through my sore wounded side;
      Then with a sigh, reason made thoughts to cry,
      "There is no god of love, save that thine eye!"

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Forgive me, dear, for thundering on thy name;
      Sure 'tis thyself that shows my love distrest.
      For fire exhaled in freezing clouds possessed,
    Warring for way, makes all the heavens exclaim.
    Thy beauty so, the brightest living flame,
      Wrapt in my cloudy heart, by winter prest,
      Scorning to dwell within so base a nest,
    Thunders in me thy everlasting flame.
      O that my heart might still contain that fire!
    Or that the fire would always light my heart!
      Then should'st thou not disdain my true desire,
    Or think I wronged thee to reveal to my smart;
      For as the fire through freezing clouds doth break,
      So not myself but thou in me would'st speak.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My heart mine eye accuseth of his death,
      Saying his wanton sight bred his unrest;
      Mine eye affirms my heart's unconstant faith
      Hath been his bane, and all his joys repressed.
    My heart avows mine eye let in the fire,
      Which burns him with an everliving light.
      Mine eye replies my greedy heart's desire
      Let in those floods, which drown him day and night.
    Thus wars my heart which reason doth maintain,
      And calls my eye to combat if he dare,
      The whilst my soul impatient of disdain,
      Wrings from his bondage unto death more near;
    Save that my love still holdeth him in hand;
    A kingdom thus divided cannot stand!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d d c e e

    Unhappy day, unhappy month and season,
      When first proud love, my joys away adjourning,
      Poured into mine eye to her eye turning
    A deadly juice, unto my green thought's reason.
    Prisoner I am unto the eye I gaze on;
      Eternally my love's flame is in burning;
      A mortal shaft still wounds me in my mourning;
    Thus prisoned, burnt and slain, the spirit, soul and reason.
      What tides me then since these pains which annoy me,
    In my despair are evermore increasing?
    The more I love, less is my pain's releasing;
      That cursed be the fortune which destroys me,
    The hour, the month, the season, and the cause,
    When love first made me thrall to lovers' laws.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d d c e e

    Love hath I followed all too long, nought gaining;
      And sighed I have in vain to sweet what smarteth,
      But from his brow a fiery arrow parteth,
    Thinking that I should him resist not plaining.
    But cowardly my heart submiss remaining,
      Yields to receive what shaft thy fair eye darteth.
      Well do I see thine eye my bale imparteth,
    And that save death no hope I am detaining.
    For what is he can alter fortune's sliding?
      One in his bed consumes his life away,
      Other in wars, another in the sea;
    The like effects in me have their abiding;
      For heavens avowed my fortune should be such,
      That I should die by loving far too much.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

    My God, my God, how much I love my goddess,
      Whose virtues rare, unto the heavens arise!
      My God, my God, how much I love her eyes
      One shining bright, the other full of hardness!
    My God, my God, how much I love her wisdom,
      Whose works may ravish heaven's richest maker!
      Of whose eyes' joys if I might be partaker
      Then to my soul a holy rest would come.
    My God, how much I love to hear her speak!
      Whose hands I kiss and ravished oft rekisseth,
      When she stands wotless whom so much she blesseth.
      Say then, what mind this honest love would break;
    Since her perfections pure, withouten blot,
    Makes her beloved of thee, she knoweth not?

    The first created held a joyous bower,
      A flowering field, the world's sole wonderment,
      High Paradise, from whence a woman's power
      Enticed him to fall to endless banishment.
    This on the banks of Euphrates did stand,
      Till the first Mover, by his wondrous might,
      Planted it in thine eyes, thy face, thy hands,
      From whence the world receives his fairest light.
    Thy cheeks contain choice flowers; thy eyes, two suns;
      Thy hands, the fruit that no life blood can stain;
      And in thy breath, that heavenly music wons,
      Which, when thou speak'st, angels their voices strain.
    As from the first thy sex exiled me,
    So to this next let me be called by thee!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Fair grace of graces, muse of muses all,
      Thou Paradise, thou only heaven I know!
      What influence hath bred my hateful woe,
    That I from thee and them am forced to fall?
    Thou falled from me, from thee I never shall,
      Although my fortunes thou hast brought so low;
      Yet shall my faith and service with thee go,
    For live I do, on heaven and thee to call.
    Banish'd all grace, no graces with me dwell;
      Compelled to muse, my muses from me fly;
      Excluded heaven, what can remain but hell?
      Exiled from paradise, in hate I lie,
    Cursing my stars; albeit I find it true,
    I lost all these when I lost love and you.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    What viewed I, dear, when I thine eyes beheld?
      Love in his glory? No, him Thyrsis saw,
      And stood the boy, whilst he his darts did draw,
    Whose painted pride to baser swains he telled.
    Saw I two suns? That sight is seen but seld.
      Yet can their brood that teach the holy law
      Gaze on their beams, and dread them not a straw,
    Where princely looks are by their eyes repelled.
      What saw I then? Doubtless it was Amen,
      Armed with strong thunder and a lightning's flame,
      Who bridegroom like with power was riding then,
    Meaning that none should see him when he came.
      Yet did I gaze; and thereby caught the wound
      Which burns my heart and keeps my body sound.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When tedious much and over weary long,
      Cruel disdain reflecting from her brow,
      Hath been the cause that I endured such wrong
      And rest thus discontent and weary now.
    Yet when posterity in time to come,
      Shall find th' uncancelled tenour of her vow,
      And her disdain be then confessed of some,
      How much unkind and long, I find it now,
    O yet even then--though then will be too late
      To comfort me; dead, many a day, ere then--
      They shall confess I did not force her heart;
      And time shall make it known to other men
    That ne'er had her disdain made me despair,
    Had she not been so excellently fair.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Had she not been so excellently fair,
      My muse had never mourned in lines of woe;
      But I did too inestimable weigh her,
      And that's the cause I now lament me so.
    Yet not for her contempt do I complain me:
      Complaints may ease the mind, but that is all;
      Therefore though she too constantly disdain me,
      I can but sigh and grieve, and so I shall.
    Yet grieve I not because I must grieve ever;
      And yet, alas, waste tears away, in vain;
      I am resolved truly to persever,
      Though she persisteth in her old disdain.
    But that which grieves me most is that I see
    Those which most fair, the most unkindest be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f f g g

    Thus long imposed to everlasting plaining,
      Divinely constant to the worthiest fair,
      And moved by eternally disdaining,
      Aye to persever in unkind despair:
    Because now silence wearily confined
      In tedious dying and a dumb restraint,
      Breaks forth in tears from mine unable mind
      To ease her passion by a poor complaint;
    O do not therefore to thyself suggest
      That I can grieve to have immured so long
      Upon the matter of mine own unrest;
      Such grief is not the tenour of my song,
      That 'bide so zealously so bad a wrong.
    My grief is this; unless I speak and plain me,
    Thou wilt persever ever to disdain me.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f f g g

    Thou wilt persever ever to disdain me;
      And I shall then die, when thou will repent it.
      O do not therefore from complaint restrain me,
      And take my life from me, to me that lent it!
    For whilst these accents, weepingly exprest
      In humble lines of reverentest zeal,
      Have issue to complaint from mine unrest,
      They but thy beauty's wonder shall reveal;
    And though the grieved muse of some other lover,
      Whose less devotions knew but woes like mine,
      Would rather seek occasion to discover
      How little pitiful and how much unkind,
      They other not so worthy beauties find.
    O, I not so! but seek with humble prayer,
    Means how to move th' unmercifullest fair.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    As draws the golden meteor of the day
      Exhaled matter from the ground to heaven,
      And by his secret nature, there to stay
      The thing fast held, and yet of hold bereaven;
    So by th' attractive excellence and might,
      Born to the power of thy transparent eyes,
      Drawn from myself, ravished with thy delight,
      Whose dumb conceits divinely sirenise,
    Lo, in suspense of fear and hope upholden,
      Diversely poised with passions that pain me,
      No resolution dares my thoughts embolden,
      Since 'tis not I, but thou that dost sustain me.
    O if there's none but thou can work my woe,
    Wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so,
      Whose humbled vows with sorrowful appeal
      Do still persist, and did so long ago
      Intreat for pity with so pure a zeal?
    Suffice the world shall, for the world can say
      How much thy power hath power, and what it can;
      Never was victor-hand yet moved to slay
      The rendered captive, or the yielding man.
    Then, O, why should thy woman-thought impose
      Death and disdain on him that yields his breath,
      To free his soul from discontent and woes,
      And humble sacrifice to a certain death?
    O since the world knows what the power can do,
    What were't for thee to save and love me too?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I meet not mine by others' discontent,
      For none compares with me in true devotion;
      Yet though my tears and sighs to her be spent,
      Her cruel heart disdains what they do motion.
    Yet though persisting in eternal hate,
      To aggravate the cause of my complaining,
      Her fury ne'er confineth with a date,
      I will not cease to love, for her disdaining.
    Such puny thoughts of unresolved ground,
      Whose inaudacity dares but base conceit,
      In me and my love never shall be found.
      Those coward thoughts unworthy minds await.
    But those that love well have not yet begun;
    Persever ever and have never done!

TITLE The Eighth Decade

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Persever ever and have never done,
      You weeping accent of my weary song!
      O do not you eternal passions shun,
      But be you true and everlasting long!
    Say that she doth requite you with disdain;
      Yet fortified with hope, endure your fortune;
      Though cruel now she will be kind again;
      Such haps as those, such loves as yours importune.
    Though she protests the faithfullest severity
      Inexecrable beauty is inflicting,
      Kindness in time will pity your sincerity,
      Though now it be your fortune's interdicting.
    For some can say, whose loves have known like passion,
    "Women are kind by kind, and coy for fashion."

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Give period to my matter of complaining,
      Fair wonder of our time's admiring eye,
      And entertain no more thy long disdaining,
      Or give me leave at last that I may die.
    For who can live, perpetually secluded
      From death to life, that loathes her discontent?
      Lest by some hope seducively deluded,
      Such thoughts aspire to fortunate event;
    But I that now have drawn mal-pleasant breath
      Under the burden of thy cruel hate,
      O, I must long and linger after death,
      And yet I dare not give my life her date;
    For if I die and thou repent t' have slain me,
    'Twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    'Twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me,
      That I should die; and thou, because I die so.
      And yet to die, it should not know to pain me,
      If cruel beauty were content to bid so.
    Death to my life, life to my long despair
      Prolonged by her, given to my love and days,
      Are means to tell how truly she is fair,
      And I can die to testify her praise.
    Yet not to die, though fairness me despiseth,
      Is cause why in complaint I thus persever;
      Though death me and my love inparadiseth,
      By interdicting me from her for ever.
    I do not grieve that I am forced to die,
    But die to think upon the reason why.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My tears are true. Though others be divine,
      And sing of wars and Troy's new rising frame,
      Meeting heroic feet in every line,
      That tread high measures in the scene of fame,
    And I, though disaccustoming my muse,
      And sing but low songs in an humble vein,
      May one day raise my style as others use,
      And turn Elizon to a higher strain.
    When re-intombing from oblivious ages
      In better stanzas her surviving wonder,
      I may opposed against the monster rage
      That part desert and excellence asunder;
    That she though coy may yet survive to see,
    Her beauty's wonder lives again in me.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d d c e e

    Sometimes in verse I praised, sometimes in verse sighed;
      No more shall pen with love and beauty mell,
      But to my heart alone my heart shall tell
    How unseen flames do burn it day and night,
    Lest flames give light, light bring my love to sight,
      And my love prove my folly to excel.
      Wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell,
    Wherein is fire and yet there is no light;
      For if one never loved like me, then why
    Skill-less blames he the thing he doth not know?
    And he that so hath loved should favour show,
      For he hath been a fool as well as I.
    Thus shall henceforth more pain, more folly have;
    And folly past, may justly pardon crave.

TITLE A CALCULATION UPON THE BIRTH OF AN HONOURABLE LADY'S DAUGHTER, BORN IN THE YEAR 1588 AND ON A FRIDAY

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d d c e e

    Fair by inheritance, whom born we see
      Both in the wondrous year and on the day
      Wherein the fairest planet beareth sway,
    The heavens to thee this fortune doth decree!
    Thou of a world of hearts in time shall be
      A monarch great, and with one beauty's ray
      So many hosts of hearts thy face shall slay,
    As all the rest for love shall yield to thee,
      But even as Alexander when he knew
      His father's conquests wept, lest he should leave
      No kingdom unto him for to subdue:
    So shall thy mother thee of praise bereave;
      So many hearts already she hath slain,
      As few behind to conquer shall remain.

    Delight in your bright eyes my death did breed,
      As light and glittering weapons babes allure
      To play with fire and sword, and so procure
    Then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed,
    Thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed;
      Yet shall my ashes and my blood assure
      Thy beauty's fame forever to endure;
    For thy fame's life from my death doth proceed;
      Because my heart to ashes burned giveth
    Life to thy fame, thou right a phoenix art,
      And like a pelican thy beauty liveth
    By sucking blood out of my breast and heart.
      Lo why with wonder we may thee compare
      Unto the pelican and phoenix rare!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d d c e e

    Eyes curious to behold what nature can create,
      Come see, come see, and write what wonder you do see,
      Causing by true report our next posterity
    Curse fortune for that they were born too late!
    Come then and come ye all, come soon lest that
      The time should be too short and men too few should be;
      For all be few to write her least part's history,
    Though they should ever write and never write but that.
      Millions look on her eyes, millions think on her wit,
    Millions speak of her, millions write of her hand.
    The whole eye on the lip I do not understand;
      Millions too few to praise but some one part of it,
    As either of her eye or lip or hand to write,
    The light or black, the taste or red, the soft or white.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c c d e d e

    Lady of ladies, the delight alone
      For which to heaven earth doth no envy bear;
      Seeing and hearing thee, we see and hear
    Such voice, such light, as never sung nor shone.
    The want of heaven I grant yet we may moan,
      Not for the pleasure of the angels there,
      As though in face or voice they like thee were,
    But that they many be, and thou but one.
      The basest notes which from thy voice proceed,
      The treble of the angels do exceed,
    So that I fear their choir to beautify,
      Lest thou to some in heaven shall sing and shine.
    Lo, when I hear thee sing, the reason why
      Sighs of my breast keep time with notes of thine!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Not that thy hand is soft, is sweet, is white,
      Thy lips sweet roses, breast sweet lily is,
      That love esteems these three the chiefest bliss
    Which nature ever made for lips' delight;
    But when these three to show their heavenly might
      Such wonders do, devotion then for this
      Commandeth us with humble zeal to kiss
    Such things as work miracles in our sight.
    A lute of senseless wood, by nature dumb,
      Touched by thy hand doth speak divinely well;
    And from thy lips and breast sweet tunes do come
        To my dead heart, the which new life do give.
      Of greater wonders heard we never tell
        Than for the dumb to speak, the dead to live.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    When beauty to the world vouchsafes this bliss,
      To show the one whose other there is not,
      The whitest skins red blushing shame doth blot,
    And in the reddest cheeks pale envy is.
    The fair and foul come thus alike by this;
      For when the sun hath our horizon got,
      Venus herself doth shine no more, God wot,
    Than the least star that takes the light from his.
      The poor in beauty thus content remain
    To see their jealous cause revenged in thee,
      And their fair foes afflicted with like pain.
    Lo, the clear proof of thy divinity;
      For unto God is only due this praise
      The highest to pluck down, the low to raise!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Miracle of the world! I never will deny
      That former poets praise the beauty of their days;
      But all those beauties were but figures of thy praise,
    And all those poets did of thee but prophesy.
    Thy coming to the world hath taught us to descry
      What Petrarch's Laura meant, for truth the lip bewrays.
      Lo, why th' Italians, yet which never saw thy rays,
    To find out Petrarch's sense such forged glosses try!
    The beauties which he in a veil enclosed beheld
      But revelations were within his surest heart
    By which in parables thy coming he foretold;
        His songs were hymns of thee, which only now before
      Thy image should be sung; for thou that goddess art
        Which only we without idolatry adore.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d e c d e

    Now, now I love indeed, and suffer more
      In one day now then I did in a year;
      Great flames they be which but small sparkles were,
    And wounded now, I was but pricked before.
    No marvel then, though more than heretofore
      I weep and sigh; how can great wounds be there
      Where moisture runs not out? and ever, where
    The fire is great, of smoke there must be store.
    My heart was hitherto but like green wood,
      Which must be dried before it will burn bright;
        My former love served but my heart to dry;
    Now Cupid for his fire doth find it good:
      For now it burneth clear, and shall give light
        For all the world your beauty to espy.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c e d e

    Dear, though from me your gratious looks depart,
      And of that comfort do myself bereave,
      Which both I did deserve and did receive,
    Triumph not over much in this my smart.
    Nay, rather they which now enjoy thy heart
      For fear just cause of mourning should conceive,
      Lest thou inconstant shouldst their trust deceive
    Which like unto the weather changing art.
    For in foul weather birds sing often will
      In hope of fair, and in fair time will cease,
    For fear fair time should not continue still;
        So they may mourn which have thy heart possessed
      For fear of change, and hope of change may ease
        Their hearts whom grief of change doth now molest.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c c d e d e

    If ever any justly might complain
      Of unrequited service, it is I;
      Change is the thanks I have for loyalty,
    And only her reward is her disdain;
    So as just spite did almost me constrain,
      Through torment her due praises to deny,
      For he which vexed is with injury
    By speaking ill doth ease his heart of pain.
      But what, shall torture make me wrong her name?
      No, no, a pris'ner constant thinks it shame,
      Though he (were) racked his first truth to gainsay.
        Her true given praise my first confession is;
      Though her disdain do rack me night and day,
        This I confessed, and will deny in this.

1   How shall we praise thee, who art England's praise
2   And with the soul of her soul most accords,
3   So that she vaunteth to the end of days
4   England and Shakespeare high, fast-wedded words?
5   O Royal thou, that spake us a new earth
6   And new fair heavens, and a proud new sea,
7   Greener is April, boasting of thy birth,
8   More blossom'd May, because she swaddled thee!
9   Before thy wisdom humbly stand the wise,
10   Judged of thy goodness, Virtue hath no cause,
11   Whoever mounts, a feeble feather tries
12   By thy great pinion; and except thou pause,
13   The sweetest singer falters in his scale--
14   Eagle, and Lark, and Swan, and Nightingale!

1   What wife had he, what sweetheart, what fair love?
2   So will the gossips ask themselves when Fame
3   Shall set her impudent lips upon my name
4   And make an auction for your cast-off glove.
5   They know you not. You are a brooding dove,
6   Whose spirit, fearful of the world's sharp flame,
7   Nestles unto the goodness whence it came,
8   And hath nor wish to range nor will to rove.
9   Yet, that through dusty Time you may not pass
10   Unpictured, unenshrined, or unadored,
11   I build this turret of eternal brass,
12   Wherein, so long as word may chime with word,
13   You are to sit before your jewelled glass
14   Beautiful as the Garden of the Lord.

1   The cherry whitens in the April air,
2   Young Spring has spilt her magic on the wold,
3   The woodlands ring with rapture as of old,
4   And England lies new-washen, green and fair;
5   Yet is she heavy with a secret care,
6   For Death the ever-sharp and over-bold
7   Hath taken our Tongue of Honey, our Throat of Gold;
8   And we have digged a pit, and left him there.
9   So must he sleep, though it be high broad noon,
10   Or Venus glister in the darkling firs:
11   The roses and the music are forgot;
12   Even the great round marigold of a moon,
13   That is for lovers and for harvesters,
14   And all the sighing seas, may move him not.

2   And the long doubt and the disputed throne,
3   And the contempts which turn the heart to stone,--
4   Who that hath wit shall breathe you a regret?
5   Who that hath tears shall pay you pity's debt?
6   Unto your place of easing you are gone,
7   Having fetched for us Beauty from her own
8   Lodges of gold by silver orchards set.
9   O mortal man that looked in angels' eyes
10   And still of baseness took both rood and reed,
11   Griever who wed bright visions to great sounds,
12   Teller of sorrowful proud histories;

14   And it is well that they no longer bleed.

1   Along the English lanes a budding green,
2   Upon the English orchards pink and white,
3   And over them the rapture and delight
4   Of April sunshine! Fair and fresh and clean,
5   Washen as if in wells of hyaline
6   And very wondrous to the pilgrim sight;
7   A glad, new land of all things soft and bright--
8   Oh, surely, here an angel must have been
9   And left his blessing! . . . Dead, young son of ours,
10   Who didst so proudly taste the loving-cup,
11   Whose blood but now shone like a living rose
12   Dropped by the Lord upon the Flanders snows,

14   For this, the England you have given up?

1   We were all sore and broken and keen on sleep,
2   Tumours and hearts and dropsies, there we lay,
3   Weary of night and wearier of day,
4   With no more health in us than rotten sheep.
5   Then, tossed to us on some intangible deep,
6   Alicia came, and each man learnt to pray
7   That Providence would please find out a way
8   To still or abate the voice with which she would weep.
9   God's infinite mercy, how that child did cry,
10   In spite of bottle, bauble, peppermint, nurse!
11   The Tumour said he'd "tell the manager,"
12   The Dropsy mumbled forth his bitterest curse;
13   But still she wailed and wailed. And when we die
14   We shall be sainted for forgiving her.

3   Behemoth rushes blindly from the night,
4   Behemoth whom we have praised on instruments
5   Dulcet and shrill and impudent with vents:
6   Behemoth whose huge body was our delight
7   And miracle, wallows where there is no light,
8   Shattered and crumpled and torn with pitiful rents.
9   O towers of steel and masts that gored the moon,
10   On you we blazoned our pomp and lust and pelf,
11   And we have died like excellent proud kings

3   For joy which knoweth neither tie nor tether
4   And is not troubled if the world grows old;

6   And held your life lightly as any feather,
7   Sleep the high sleep that dead men sleep together,
8   Careless of what is done and what is told.
9   I know that all our England shone before you
10   When you went down. It made a radiance

11   The dagger of anguish with the ice-cold hilt,

5   The Sceptre and the Orb are put away;

9   O mighty Death, the mightiest are thine,
10   Thou set'st his Widow weeping in her place,
11   And while thou pluck'st her heart with thy chill hand,

1   At five o'clock they ring a tinkly bell;
2   The April dawn glimmers along the beds,
3   There is a lifting up of weary heads
4   From weary pillows. Our old citadel
5   Hath still held out, and while the miracle
6   Of morning is unbared again, and spreads
7   All the young East with greens and blues and reds
8   Each of us wakes to his particular hell.
9   But even on this bitter shore of Styx
10   Where Life to dogged Death puts the last schism,
11   We kindle for the ending of the dark:
12   The Asthma feebly jokes the Aneurism,
13   The little bandaged boy in Number Six
14   Sings "Ye shall die" with a voice like a lark.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d e d c e

1   I wonder which hath triumphed, you or Death?
2   For he has torn you ultimately from your place,
3   And shattered all the woman in your face,
4   And put his last injunction on your breath,
5   And ferried you across to his dim staith
6   Where there is none who hath either hope or grace,
7   But only the unimaginable race
8   Of broken souls his wing encompasseth.
9   O pitiful and pitiful! And yet
10   Not all he asks is yielded up to him,
11   And we who fight have our shrewd joy therefor:
12   Upon your brow sitteth a shining, grim
13   Rapture of wars, and on your lips is set
14   To-night the still smile of the conqueror.

1   And when I die, you should be grieved, and go
2   Dumbly into the bitter fields alone,
3   For you have long since made your widow's moan,
4   And carried in your heart the widow's woe.
5   Outrageous Death hath neither feint nor blow
6   To hurt you further. Thus without a groan
7   I shall go down, and be as cold as stone,
8   And you will kiss me and I shall not know.
9   But haply then some mercy may befall,
10   And to your breast, this death in life being past,
11   Quiet may come and peace without alloy:
12   Seeing you lone and lovely and downcast
13   They will possess you with a secret joy
14   And keep you with an angel at your call.

1   These are the fights of Love and Joy and Men
2   With Fate and Death and the illicit Beast,
3   For guerdons, of which Glory is the least
4   And Honour not the highest. The old reign
5   Of Night shall topple, the old Wrongs be slain:
6   Fitting it is that you go to the Feast
7   While angel suns kindle the young-eyed east
8   And bring the breath of Eden back again.
9   Oh soldiers' hour! . . . For now the English rose
10   Flames and is washed with the authentic dew
11   And through the mist her ancient crimson shows:
12   I see your shadows on the waking lawn
13   Like shadows of kings, and all the souls of you
14   Blazoned and bright and panoplied in the dawn.

1   He is gone hence. Weep no weak tears for him:
2   You gave us freely what you valued most;
3   It is not loss, for gifts are never lost
4   Unto the giver. Lo, the star-kept, dim
5   Limits where battle fades away, and grim
6   Death halts and hath no power! On that coast
7   His feet are set among the shining host
8   Who range with cherubim and seraphim.
9   A thousand suns are unregarded dust,
10   A million dawns break and are counted not,
11   And Beauty riseth up, and she departs
12   Eternally--eternally forgot;
13   But your fair stripling, dead beside his trust,
14   Is safely folded in the Heart of Hearts.

3   Like lovely words caught in a lovely rhyme,
4   Or silver stars kept in a faery net.
5   Ivory and marble hold them for us yet,
6   And all our blossomy memories of them chime
7   With all the honest graces of the prime--
8   Helen, and Ruth, Elaine, and Juliet.
9   And You, in this disconsolate London square
10   Flaunting an ill-considered purple hat
11   And mud-stained, rumpled, bargain-counter coat,

14   Sprawl on the flagstones chalking for a vote!

3   These prancing stomachs who amass and own,
4   Inherit and squander, and have nets and chains
5   And panoplies of penalties and pains
6   Wherewith to extort the uttermost half-crown;
7   For whom indeed the world's hard fields are sown
8   And its scant harvests gathered on gorged wains.
9   Withal, we must believe good things of them,
10   And show a kindly bosom while they stand
11   Grinning out of their proud and cunning eyes;
12   Nay, even the chiefest shall not stir our phlegm,
13   For he hath still knowledge of Paradise,
14   And hides an angel's feather in his hand.

1   Out of my silver turrets I look down
2   Upon a garden wherein sleeps a rose
3   Who hath a ruby heart; beside her glows
4   Unblemished, in a drifted, vestal gown
5   Yon lily, and beyond them lies a town
6   Of tufted green and each sweet bloom that blows;
7   Midmost from whence a little fountain throws
8   His gentle sprays which seem but half his own.
9   And on the lake that skirts our dreary wood
10   There sails for ever a new-washen swan,
11   Who is as white as milk or angels are:
12   At dawn he glitters in the solitude,
13   At dusk he goeth glimmering and wan
14   To where one waits him, white like a young star.

1   A minx of seventeen, with rather fine
2   Brown eyes and freckles and a cheerful grin,
3   She saunters up the ward, and stricken sin
4   Nods and looks pleasant (why should one repine?).
5   She takes "her cases," looks for every "sign,"
6   Hammers and sounds the portly and the thin,
7   Plies them with questions till their cheap heads spin
8   And keeps them busy saying "ninety-nine."
9   It's my turn now! Oh, let me bare my chest
10   And spread a level sheet across my crib,
11   And be as wax for our meticulous Miss;
12   While she, poor dear, doing her anxious best,
13   Feels for the apex under the wrong rib
14   And wonders fiercely where my liver is.

2   Out of its grubbing to throw greasy pence
3   Forth to the hat, and choke with eloquence
4   In boastful prose and verse of doubtful staves?
5   Four men have died, gentlemen, heroes, braves;
6   Snows wrap them round eternally. From thence
7   They may no more return to life or sense
8   And a steel moon aches down on their chill graves.
9   "They died for England." It is excellent
10   To die for England. Death is oft the prize
11   Of him who bears the burden and the load.
12   So with a glory let our lives be spent--
13   We may be noble in the Minories
14   And die for England in the Camden Road.

5   On the large hills, or drowns in the old deeps,

11   Who art the lord of laughter and of lust,

2   She is become a ruinous, delicate wraith,
3   And now she gives her perfumes up to Death;
4   No longer may she shine in the sweet light,
5   Or drink the dewey darkness; for the might
6   That breaks the hearts of kings and staggereth
7   Bold men, hath borne her down. "Take me," she saith,
8   "Unto the old, dead roses, red and white."
9   So, dearest, when the ultimate foul dun
10   And crawling knave into our hand shall thrust
11   His figure of accompt and greedy fine
12   For our poor gladness underneath the sun,

61   There was a foul
62   And livid, living thing
63   That wept and died,
64   Having no soul.

RHYME a b c a

65   The lips of it
66   Scarlet with lies
67   And impudent with leers,
68   And on its forehead writ

RHYME a b c a

69   Evil and bale;
70   And it hath fellowship
71   Malefic as itself,
72   But clad in cunninger mail.

RHYME a b c a

73   For ever, walls of fire
74   And chasms of swords
75   'Twixt your green country
76   And the world's mire.

RHYME a b c a

77   It were a sin
78   That echo or breath
79   Should reach to your tower
80   From tents they riot in.

RHYME a b c a

81   Yet their desert
82   Lifts them, and deviously
83   From these and thence
84   Cometh the hurt.

RHYME a b c a

85   Into your book,
86   Jewelled with flame
87   And clamped with honour,
88   Who shall look?

RHYME a b c a

89   Borders of woe,
90   Letters of blood,
91   Upon a page
92   Of milk and snow.

RHYME a b c a

93   This justice for the just
94   Thereby you read--
95   Ashes to ashes
96   Dust to dust.

RHYME a b a b

1   Smile, O master of life,
2   Safe in thy silver house,
3   Be pleased with thy pleasant wife--
4   Soon thou hast woe for spouse.

RHYME a b a b

5   Joy and joy are thy choice--
6   (Shrewd art thou past a doubt!)
7   Take they joy and rejoice--
8   Sorrow shall find thee out.

RHYME a b a b

9   Laugh thou loud at the fool
10   Munching his bitter bread;--
11   Surely as thou dost rule
12   One shall rule in thy stead.

RHYME a b a b

13   What though thy heart be flame,
14   And perfume all thy breath?--
15   Who hath written thy name
16   Here in the book of Death?

RHYME a b a b

17   Yea, though thou shine rose-white
18   Or though thou burn rose-red,
19   Upon the lawful night
20   Thou shalt lie spent and sped.

RHYME a b a b

21   Drink that is soft and sound!
22   Meats for the delicate maw!--
23   Already the beldame is found
24   Who shall tape-up that jaw.

RHYME a b a b

25   Build through the golden day
26   Cunning in every stroke--
27   Adze from his bench must say,
28   "Shall it be elm or oak?"

RHYME a b a b

29   And though thou hast all grace,
30   All wisdom, and all wit,
31   Mattock, in the right place,
32   Will delve the appointed pit.

RHYME a b a b

33   With faith thou art rich; and firm
34   In hopes like the young east--
35   Let us promise the worm
36   His certain year-long feast!

RHYME a b a b

37   Fool that no man calls master,
38   Irredeemable slave,
39   Born for the stark disaster
40   With nothing to hope or have.

RHYME a b a b

41   Inasmuch as thou moilest
42   For sour and scanty bread,
43   Rejoice, for wherever thou toilest
44   One shall toil in thy stead.

RHYME a b a b

45   And inasmuch as they gall thee
46   And bitterness is thy breath,
47   On a day they shall call thee
48   Forth to thy lawful death.

RHYME a b a b

49   Let it not be forgotten,
50   This is the sure reward--
51   Thou shalt lie dead and rotten,
52   Even as dead as thy lord.

RHYME a b a b

53   So with the brand or the feather
54   Each hath his tally and term--
55   Let us sup nobly together,
56   "Here's to the ultimate worm!"

RHYME a b a b

57   Lo, there is anguish and wailing
58   Out of the world and her wars,
59   A cry goeth up unavailing
60   Unto the steadfast stars.

RHYME a b a b

61   Set on sweet thrones they glister
62   Over our pain and ruth,
63   Each to her shining sister
64   Telling the wordless truth.

RHYME a b a b

65   Though we be fools or sages,
66   Who is it conquereth?
67   Death shall pay this world's wages;
68   All that he pays is death.

RHYME a b a b

69   By the prayers ye have faltered,
70   By the blood and the tears,
71   Which is the law ye have altered
72   In all the faithful years?

RHYME a b a b

73   No new sign hath been given,
74   No new tale is to tell--
75   And still the earth is heaven,
76   And still the souls are hell.

RHYME a b a b

77   Death for life is the guerdon,
78   "Life for death" is the ban;
79   None might carry the burden,
80   Only the sons of man.

RHYME a b a b

81   Of whom there is no daunting
82   Beneath the pitiless sky,
83   For whom the final vaunting
84   Is "men can only die."

RHYME a b a b

85   Cursèd be he that setteth
86   Snares for the bleeding feet;
87   Cursèd be he that getteth,
88   And giveth not, good wheat.

RHYME a b a b

89   Cursèd be he that showeth,
90   Unto the simple, lies;
91   Cursèd be he that throweth
92   Dust in the star-set eyes.

1   "Now Good," quoth he,
2   "Be good for me,
3   And Evil be thou evil":
4   O simple wight!--
5   As well he might
6   Have leagued him with the Devil--
7   Who, when all's said,
8   Is a gentleman bred,
9   And civil to the civil.

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

10   He trudgeth forth,
11   Now south now north,
12   To turn the needful penny,
13   Upon his back
14   He bears a pack
15   Through suns and snows a-many
16   And mile on mile--
17   With an equal smile
18   For Richard and for Jenny.

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

19   "Yea these," he sware,
20   "Be God's own pair,
21   They will not cog or cozen,
22   In smocks they go
23   To milk and mow,
24   And threadbare are their hosen;
25   But if your due
26   Be twelve, for you
27   They'll count out the full dozen."

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

28   Yet Dick, fell wretch,
29   Did the hangman stretch,
30   For cutting a babe's weasand,
31   And by the Bench
32   That brazen wench,
33   Young Jenny, was imprisoned,
34   That folk might cry,
35   "In villainy
36   The twain were properly seasoned."

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

37   "Still Good," quoth he,
38   "Be good for me,
39   And Evil be thou evil;
40   My grandam dear,
41   Above her beer,
42   Was wont to curse the Devil,
43   `O little lad,
44   Eschew the bad
45   Which doth defile!' she'd snivel."

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

46   Upon an ass
47   He is fain to pass
48   Into the virtuous city,
49   And soon doth stop
50   With my lord bishop,
51   The learnèd and the witty:
52   ("So honest a face!"
53   Mused his lordship's grace--
54   And hired him out of pity.)

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

55   Here every saw
56   Of the moral law
57   With joy he heard repeated,
58   Till on a night
59   In the candle-light
60   The bishop's guests were seated,
61   And they played a game,
62   Bezique by name,
63   And my lord the bishop cheated.

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

64   So, nothing loth,
65   Our friend shogged off
66   To service with a person
67   Whom fools did rate
68   For a prop of the State:
69   There couldn't have been a worse 'un;
70   For by wink or grin
71   He approved the sin
72   We are bidden to put a curse on.

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

73   Then a judge he served
74   Who quite unnerved
75   This saint by actions foxy,
76   Such as bringing home quills
77   From the Office of Wills
78   And going to church by proxy,
79   And, once a week,
80   Pinching the cheek
81   Of a most offensive doxy.

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

82   "Still Good for me
83   Be good," quoth he,
84   "And Evil be thou evil;
85   I will show my mind
86   Unto mankind,
87   And speak them fair and civil,
88   And tell them how
89   All men I know
90   Are bondmen of the Devil."

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

91   He trudgeth forth
92   Both south and north
93   By markets and street corners,
94   And saith aloud
95   To the wondering crowd,
96   "Ye are plagued with thieves and scorners
97   And liars and cheats
98   And hypocrites
99   And losels and suborners!"

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

100   He was the first
101   That ever burst
102   Upon them with such tiding;
103   Eftsoons they cried,
104   "This fellow's pride
105   Is surely past abiding!"
106   And with grievous stones,
107   They bruised his bones,
108   And hurried him into hiding.

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

109   Upon the floor
110   He lies full sore,
111   Nor murmureth unduly,
112   Although he must
113   Give up the ghost
114   His speech is not unruly;
115   With his last breath
116   He uttereth
117   These words: "I ha' spoken truly!"

RHYME a a b c c b d d b

118   So passeth he
119   Most miserably,
120   Without or sniff or snivel:
121   Unhappy wight--
122   As well he might
123   Have leagued him with the Devil,
124   Who on the whole
125   Is a decent soul,
126   And returneth good for evil!

RHYME a b a b b c b c c d c d e e

    Wonder of these, glory of other times,
      O thou whom envy ev'n is forced t'admire!
      Great Patroness of these my humble rhymes,
      Which thou from out thy greatness dost inspire!
    Since only thou has deigned to raise them higher,
      Vouchsafe now to accept them as thine own,
      Begotten by thy hand and my desire,
      Wherein my zeal and thy great might is shown.
    And seeing this unto the world is known,
      O leave not still to grace thy work in me;
      Let not the quickening seed be overthrown
      Of that which may be born to honor thee,
    Whereof the travail I may challenge mine,
    But yet the glory, Madam, must be thine!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty
      Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal,
      Returning thee the tribute of my duty,
      Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal.
    Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul,
      Where I have cast th' accounts of all my care;
      Here have I summed my sighs. Here I enrol
      How they were spent for thee. Look, what they are.
    Look on the dear expenses of my youth,
      And see how just I reckon with thine eyes.
      Examine well thy beauty with my truth,
      And cross my cares ere greater sums arise.
    Read it, sweet maid, though it be done but slightly;
    Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Go, wailing verse, the infants of my love,
      Minerva-like, brought forth without a mother;
      Present the image of the cares I prove,
      Witness your father's grief exceeds all other.
    Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds,
      With interrupted accents of despair;
      A monument that whosoever reads,
      May justly praise and blame my loveless Fair;
    Say her disdain hath dried up my blood,
      And starved you, in succours still denying;
      Press to her eyes, importune me some good,
      Waken her sleeping pity with your crying:
    Knock at her hard heart, beg till you have moved her,
    And tell th'unkind how dearly I have loved her.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    If so it hap this offspring of my care,
      These fatal anthems, lamentable songs,
      Come to their view, who like afflicted are;
      Let them yet sigh their own, and moan my wrongs.
    But untouched hearts with unaffected eye,
      Approach not to behold my soul's distress;
      Clear-sighted you soon note what is awry,
      Whilst blinded souls mine errors never guess.
    You blinded souls, whom youth and error lead;
      You outcast eaglets dazzled with your sun,
      Do you, and none but you, my sorrows read;
      You best can judge the wrongs that she hath done,
    That she hath done, the motive of my pain,
    Who whilst I love doth kill me with disdain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    These plaintive verse, the posts of my desire,
      Which haste for succour to her slow regard,
      Bear not report of any slender fire,
      Forging a grief to win a fame's reward.
    Nor are my passions limned for outward hue,
      For that no colours can depaint my sorrows;
      Delia herself, and all the world may view
      Best in my face where cares have tilled deep furrows.
    No bays I seek to deck my mourning brow,
      O clear-eyed rector of the holy hill!
      My humble accents bear the olive bough
      Of intercession but to move her will.
    These lines I use t'unburden mine own heart;
    My love affects no fame nor 'steems of art.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Whilst youth and error led my wandering mind,
      And set my thoughts in heedless ways to range,
      All unawares a goddess chaste I find,
      Diana-like, to work my sudden change.
    For her, no sooner had mine eye bewrayed,
      But with disdain to see me in that place,
      With fairest hand the sweet unkindest maid
      Casts water-cold disdain upon my face.
    Which turned my sport into a hart's despair,
      Which still is chased, while I have any breath,
      By mine own thoughts set on me by my Fair.
      My thoughts like hounds pursue me to my death;
    Those that I fostered of mine own accord,
    Are made by her to murder thus their lord.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fair is my love, and cruel as she's fair;
      Her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny;
      Her smiles are lightning though her pride despair;
      And her disdains are gall, her favours honey;
    A modest maid, decked with a blush of honour,
      Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love;
      The wonder of all eyes that look upon her,
      Sacred on earth, designed a saint above.
    Chastity and beauty, which were deadly foes,
      Live reconciled friends within her brow;
      And had she pity to conjoin with those,
      Then who had heard the plaints I utter now?
    O had she not been fair and thus unkind,
    My Muse had slept and none had known my mind!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    For had she not been fair and thus unkind,
      Then had no finger pointed at my lightness;
      The world had never known what I do find,
      And clouds obscure had shaded still her brightness.
    Then had no censor's eye these lines surveyed,
      Nor graver brows have judged my Muse so vain;
      No sun my blush and error had bewrayed,
      Nor yet the world had heard of such disdain.
    Then had I walked with bold erected face;
      No downcast look had signified my miss;
      But my degraded hopes with such disgrace
      Did force me groan out griefs and utter this.
    For being full, should I not then have spoken,
    My sense oppressed had failed and heart had broken.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Thou, poor heart, sacrificed unto the fairest,
      Hast sent the incense of thy sighs to heaven;
      And still against her frowns fresh vows repairest,
      And made thy passions with her beauty even.
    And you, mine eyes, the agents of my heart,
      Told the dumb message of my hidden grief;
      And oft, with careful tunes, with silent art,
      Did treat the cruel Fair to yield relief.
    And you, my verse, the advocates of love,
      Have followed hard the process of my case:
      And urged that title which doth plainly prove
      My faith should win, if justice might have place.
    Yet though I see that nought we do can move,
    'Tis not disdain must make me cease to love.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    If this be love, to draw a weary breath,
      To paint on floods till the shore cry to th'air;
      With downward looks still reading on the earth.
      These sad memorials of my love's despair;
    If this be love, to war against my soul,
      Lie down to wail, rise up to sigh and grieve,
      The never-resting stone of care to roll,
      Still to complain my griefs, whilst none relieve;
    If this be love, to clothe me with dark thoughts,
      Haunting untrodden paths to wail apart,
      My pleasures horror, music tragic notes,
      Tears in mine eyes and sorrow at my heart;
    If this be love, to live a living death,
    Then do I love, and draw this weary breath.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Then do I love and draw this weary breath
      For her, the cruel Fair, within whose brow
      I written find the sentence of my death
      In unkind letters wrote she cares not how.
    Thou power that rul'st the confines of the night,
      Laughter-loving goddess, worldly pleasures' queen,
      Intenerate that heart that sets so light
      The truest love that ever yet was seen;
    And cause her leave to triumph in this wise
      Upon the prostrate spoil of that poor heart
      That serves, a trophy to her conquering eyes,
      And must their glory to the world impart;
    Once let her know sh'hath done enough to prove me,
    And let her pity if she cannot love me!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Tears, vows and prayers gain the hardest hearts,
      Tears, vows and prayers have I spent in vain;
      Tears cannot soften flint nor vows convert;
      Prayers prevail not with a quaint disdain.
    I lose my tears where I have lost my love,
      I vow my faith where faith is not regarded,
      I pray in vain a merciless to move;
      So rare a faith ought better be rewarded.
    Yet though I cannot win her will with tears,
      Though my soul's idol scorneth all my vows,
      Though all my prayers be to so deaf ears,
      No favour though the cruel Fair allows,
    Yet will I weep, vow, pray to cruel she;
    Flint, frost, disdain, wears, melts and yields, we see.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My spotless love hovers with purest wings
      About the temple of the proudest frame,
      Where blaze those lights, fairest of earthly things;
      Which clear our clouded world with brightest flame.
    M'ambitious thoughts, confined in her face,
      Affect no honour but what she can give;
      My hopes do rest in limits of her grace;
      I weigh no comfort unless she relieve.
    For she that can my heart imparadise,
      Holds in her fairest hand what dearest is.
      My fortune's wheel's the circle of her eyes,
      Whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss.
    All my life's sweet consists in her alone,
    So much I love the most unloving one.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Behold what hap Pygmalion had to frame
      And carve his proper grief upon a stone!
      My heavy fortune is much like the same;
      I work on flint and that's the cause I moan.
    For hapless lo, even with mine own desires
      I figured on the table of my heart
      The fairest form that the world's eye admires,
      And so did perish by my proper art.
    And still I toil to change the marble breast
      Of her whose sweetest grace I do adore,
      Yet cannot find her breathe unto my rest.
      Hard is her heart, and woe is me therefore.
    O happy he that joyed his stone and art!
    Unhappy I, to love a stony heart!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Those snary locks are those same nets, my dear,
      Wherewith my liberty thou didst surprise
      Love was the flame that fired me so near,
      The dart transpiercing were those crystal eyes.
    Strong is the net, and fervent is the flame;
      Deep is the wound my sighs can well report.
      Yet I do love, adore, and praise the same,
      That holds, that burns, that wounds in this sort;
    And list not seek to break, to quench, to heal,
      The bond, the flame, the wound that festereth so,
      By knife, by liquor, or by salve to deal;
      So much I please to perish in my woe.
    Yet lest long travails be above my strength,
    Good Delia, loose, quench, heal me, now at length!

    If that a loyal heart and faith unfeigned,
      If a sweet languish with a chaste desire,
      If hunger-starven thoughts so long retained,
      Fed but with smoke, and cherished but with fire;
    And if a brow with care's characters painted
      Bewray my love with broken words half spoken
      To her which sits in my thoughts' temple sainted,
      And lays to view my vulture-gnawn heart open;
    If I have done due homage to her eyes,
      And had my sighs still tending on her name,
      If on her love my life and honour lies,
      And she, th'unkindest maid, still scorns the same;
    Let this suffice, that all the world may see
    The fault is hers, though mine the hurt must be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Happy in sleep, waking content to languish,
      Embracing clouds by night, in daytime mourn,
      My joys but shadows, touch of truth my anguish,
      Griefs ever springing, comforts never born;
    And still expecting when she will relent,
      Grown hoarse with crying, "mercy, mercy give,"
      So many vows and prayers having spent
      That weary of my life I loathe to live;
    And yet the hydra of my cares renews
      Still new-born sorrows of her fresh disdain;
      And still my hope the summer winds pursues,
      Finding no end nor period of my pain;
    This is my state, my griefs do touch so nearly,
    And thus I live because I love her dearly.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Why should I sing in verse? Why should I frame
      These sad neglected notes for her dear sake?
      Why should I offer up unto her name,
      The sweetest sacrifice my youth can make?
    Why should I strive to make her live for ever,
      That never deigns to give me joy to live?
      Why should m'afflicted Muse so much endeavour
      Such honour unto cruelty to give?
    If her defects have purchased her this fame,
      What should her virtues do, her smiles, her love?
      If this her worst, how should her best inflame?
      What passions would her milder favours move?
    Favours, I think, would sense quite overcome;
    And that makes happy lovers ever dumb.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Since the first look that led me to this error,
      To this thoughts' maze to my confusion tending,
      Still have I lived in grief, in hope, in terror,
      The circle of my sorrows never ending;
    Yet cannot leave her love that holds me hateful;
      Her eyes exact it, though her heart disdains me.
      See what reward he hath that serves th'ungrateful?
      So true and loyal love no favour gains me.
    Still must I whet my young desires abated,
      Upon the flint of such a heart rebelling;
      And all in vain; her pride is so innated,
      She yields no place at all for pity's dwelling.
    Oft have I told her that my soul did love her,
    And that with tears; yet all this will not move her.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Restore thy tresses to the golden ore,
      Yield Cytherea's son those arks of love;
      Bequeath the heavens the stars that I adore,
      And to the orient do thy pearls remove;
    Yield thy hands' pride unto the ivory white;
      T'Arabian odours give thy breathing sweet;
      Restore thy blush unto Aurora bright;
      To Thetis give the honour of thy feet.
    Let Venus have the graces she resigned,
      And thy sweet voice give back unto the spheres;
      But yet restore thy fierce and cruel mind
      To Hyrcan tigers and to ruthless bears;
    Yield to the marble thy hard heart again;
    So shalt thou cease to plague, and I to pain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    What it is to breathe and live without life;
      How to be pale with anguish, red with fear,
      T'have peace abroad, and nought within but strife:
      Wish to be present, and yet shun t'appear;
    How to be bold far off, and bashful near;
      How to think much, and have no words to speak;
      To crave redress, yet hold affliction dear;
      To have affection strong, a body weak,
    Never to find, yet evermore to seek;
      And seek that which I dare not hope to find;
      T'affect this life and yet this life disleek,
      Grateful t'another, to myself unkind:
    This cruel knowledge of these contraries,
    Delia, my heart hath learned out of those eyes.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    If beauty thus be clouded with a frown,
      That pity shines no comfort to my bliss,
      And vapours of disdain so overgrown,
      That my life's light wholly indarkened is,
    Why should I more molest the world with cries,
      The air with sighs, the earth below with tears,
      Since I live hateful to those ruthful eyes,
      Vexing with untuned moan her dainty ears!
    If I have loved her dearer than my breath,
      My breath that calls the heaven to witness it!--
      And still hold her most dear until my death,
      And if that all this cannot move one whit,
    Yet sure she cannot but must think apart
    She doth me wrong to grieve so true a heart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Come Time, the anchor hold of my desire,
      My last resort whereto my hopes appeal;
      Cause once the date of her disdain t'exspire,
      Make her the sentence of her wrath repeal.
    Rob her fair brow, break in on beauty, steal
      Power from those eyes which pity cannot spare;
      Deal with those dainty cheeks, as she doth deal
      With this poor heart consumed with despair.
    This heart made now the prospective of care
      By loving her, the cruelst fair that lives,
      The cruelst fair that sees I pine for her,
      And never mercy to thy merit gives.
    Let her not still triumph over the prize
    Of mine affections taken by her eyes.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Time, cruel Time, come and subdue that brow
      Which conquers all but thee, and thee too stays,
      As if she were exempt from scythe or bow,
      From love or years unsubject to decays.
    Or art thou grown in league with those fair eyes,
      That they may help thee to consume our days?
      Or dost thou spare her for her cruelties,
      Being merciless like thee that no man weighs?
    And yet thou seest thy power she disobeys,
      Cares not for thee, but lets thee waste in vain,
      And prodigal of hours and years betrays
      Beauty and youth t'opinion and disdain.
    Yet spare her, Time; let her exempted be;
    She may become more kind to thee or me.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    These sorrowing sighs, the smoke of mine annoy,
      These tears, which heat of sacred flame distils,
      Are those due tributes that my faith doth pay
      Unto the tyrant whose unkindness kills.
    I sacrifice my youth and blooming years
      At her proud feet, and she respects not it;
      My flower, untimely's withered with my tears,
      By winter woes for spring of youth unfit.
    She thinks a look may recompense my care,
      And so with looks prolongs my long-looked ease;
      As short that bliss, so is the comfort rare;
      Yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease.
    Thus she returns my hopes so fruitless ever;
    Once let her love indeed, or eye me never!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    False hope prolongs my ever certain grief,
      Traitor to me, and faithful to my love.
      A thousand times it promised me relief,
      Yet never any true effect I prove.
    Oft when I find in her no truth at all,
      I banish her, and blame her treachery;
      Yet soon again I must her back recall,
      As one that dies without her company.
    Thus often, as I chase my hope from me,
      Straightway she hastes her unto Delia's eyes;
      Fed with some pleasing look, there shall she be,
      And so sent back. And thus my fortune lies;
    Looks feed my hope, hope fosters me in vain;
    Hopes are unsure when certain is my pain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Look in my griefs, and blame me not to mourn,
      From care to care that leads a life so bad;
      Th'orphan of fortune, born to be her scorn,
      Whose clouded brow doth make my days so sad.
    Long are their nights whose cares do never sleep,
      Loathsome their days who never sun yet joyed;
      The impression of her eyes do pierce so deep,
      That thus I live both day and night annoyed.
    Yet since the sweetest root yields fruit so sour,
      Her praise from my complaint I may not part;
      I love th'effect, the cause being of this power;
      I'll praise her face and blame her flinty heart,
    Whilst we both make the world admire at us,
    Her for disdain, and me for loving thus.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Reignin my thoughts, fair hand, sweet eye, rare voice!
      Possess me whole, my heart's triumvirate!
      Yet heavy heart, to make so hard a choice
      Of such as spoil thy poor afflicted state!
    For whilst they strive which shall be lord of all,
      All my poor life by them is trodden down;
      They all erect their trophies on my fall,
      And yield me nought that gives them their renown.
    When back I look, I sigh my freedom past,
      And wail the state wherein I present stand,
      And see my fortune ever like to last,
      Finding me reined with such a heavy hand.
    What can I do but yield? and yield I do;
    And serve all three, and yet they spoil me too!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Whilst by thy eyes pursued, my poor heart flew
      Into the sacred refuge of thy breast;
      Thy rigour in that sanctuary slew
      That which thy succ'ring mercy should have blest.
    No privilege of faith could it protect,
      Faith being with blood and five years witness signed,
      Wherein no show gave cause of least suspect,
      For well thou saw'st my love and how I pined.
    Yet no mild comfort would thy brow reveal,
      No lightning looks which falling hopes erect;
      What boots to laws of succour to appeal?
      Ladies and tyrants never laws respect.
    Then there I die from whence my life should come,
    And by that hand whom such deeds ill become.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Still in the trace of one perplexed thought,
      My ceaseless cares continually run on,
      Seeking in vain what I have ever sought,
      One in my love, and her hard heart still one.
    I who did never joy in other sun,
      And have no stars but those that must fulfil
      The work of rigour, fatally begun
      Upon this heart whom cruelty will kill,
    Injurious Delia!--yet, I love thee still,
      And will whilst I shall draw this breath of mine;
      I'll tell the world that I deserved but ill,
      And blame myself, t'excuse that heart of thine;
    See then who sins the greater of us twain,
    I in my love, or thou in thy disdain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Oft do I marvel whether Delia's eyes
      Are eyes, or else two radiant stars that shine;
      For how could nature ever thus devise
      Of earth, on earth, a substance so divine?
    Stars, sure, they are, whose motions rule desires,
      And calm and tempest follow their aspects;
      Their sweet appearing still such power inspires,
      That makes the world admire so strange effects.
    Yet whether fixed or wandering stars are they,
      Whose influence rules the orb of my poor heart;
      Fixed, sure, they are, but wandering make me stray
      In endless errors whence I cannot part.
    Stars, then, not eyes, move you with milder view
    Your sweet aspect on him that honours you!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    The star of my mishap imposed this pain
      To spend the April of my years in grief;
      Finding my fortune ever in the wane,
      With still fresh cares, supplied with no relief.
    Yet thee I blame not, though for thee 'tis done;
      But these weak wings presuming to aspire,
      Which now are melted by thine eyes' bright sun
      That makes me fall from off my high desire;
    And in my fall I cry for help with speed,
      No pitying eye looks back upon my fears;
      No succour find I now when most I need:
      My heats must drown in th'ocean of my tears,
    Which still must bear the title of my wrong,
    Caused by those cruel beams that were so strong.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    And yet I cannot reprehend the flight,
      Or blame th'attempt, presuming so to soar;
      The mounting venture for a high delight
      Did make the honour of the fall the more.
    For who gets wealth, that puts not from the shore?
      Danger hath honours, great designs their fame,
      Glory doth follow, courage goes before;
      And though th'event oft answers not the same,
    Suffice that high attempts have never shame.
      The mean observer whom base safety keeps,
      Lives without honour, dies without a name,
      And in eternal darkness ever sleeps.
    And therefore, Delia, 'tis to me no blot
    To have attempted though attained thee not.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d c c

    Raising my hopes on hills of high desire,
      Thinking to scale the heaven of her heart,
      My slender means presumed too high a part,
    Her thunder of disdain forced me retire,
    And threw me down to pain in all this fire,
      Where lo, I languish in so heavy smart
      Because th'attempt was far above my art;
    Her pride brooked not poor souls should come so nigh her.
    Yet, I protest, my high desiring will
      Was not to dispossess her of her right;
      Her sovereignty should have remained still;
      I only sought the bliss to have her sight.
    Her sight, contented thus to see me spill,
    Framed my desires fit for her eyes to kill.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Why dost thou, Delia, credit so thy glass,
      Gazing thy beauty deigned thee by the skies,
      And dost not rather look on him, alas!
      Whose state best shows the force of murdering eyes?
    The broken tops of lofty trees declare
      The fury of a mercy-wanting storm;
      And of what force thy wounding graces are
      Upon myself, you best may find the form.
    Then leave thy glass, and gaze thyself on me;
      That mirror shows what power is in thy face;
      To view your form too much may danger be,
      Narcissus changed t'a flower in such a case.
    And you are changed, but not t'a hyacinth;
    I fear your eye hath turned your heart to flint.

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d c d

    I once may see when years shall wreck my wrong,
      And golden hairs shall change to silver wire,
      And those bright rays that kindle all this fire,
    Shall fail in force, their working not so strong,
    Then beauty, now the burden of my song,
      Whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire,
      Must yield up all to tyrant Time's desire;
    Then fade those flowers that decked her pride so long.
    When if she grieve to gaze her in her glass,
      Which then presents her whiter-withered hue,
    Go you, my verse, go tell her what she was,
      For what she was, she best shall find in you.
      Your fiery heat lets not her glory pass,
      But phoenix-like shall make her live anew.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Look, Delia, how w'esteem the half-blown rose,
      The image of thy blush, and summer's honour,
      Whilst yet her tender bud doth undisclose
      That full of beauty time bestows upon her.
    No sooner spreads her glory in the air,
      But straight her wide-blown pomp comes to decline;
      She then is scorned that late adorned the fair;
      So fade the roses of those cheeks of thine.
    No April can revive thy withered flowers,
      Whose springing grace adorns thy glory now;
      Swift speedy time, feathered with flying hours,
      Dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow.
    Then do not thou such treasure waste in vain,
    But love now whilst thou mayst be loved again.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    But love whilst that thou mayst be loved again,
      Now whilst thy May hath filled thy lap with flowers,
      Now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain,
      Now use thy summer smiles, ere winter lowers.
    And whilst thou spread'st unto the rising sun,
      The fairest flower that ever saw the light,
      Now joy thy time before thy sweet be done;
      And, Delia, think thy morning must have night,
    And that thy brightness sets at length to west,
      When thou wilt close up that which now thou showest,
      And think the same becomes thy fading best,
      Which then shall most inveil and shadow most.
    Men do not weigh the stalk for that it was,
    When once they find her flower, her glory pass.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When men shall find thy flower, thy glory pass,
      And thou with careful brow sitting alone
      Received hast this message from thy glass
      That tells the truth, and says that all is gone;
    Fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou mad'st,
      Though spent thy flame, in me the heat remaining.
      I that have loved thee thus before thou fad'st,
      My faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning.
    The world shall find this miracle in me,
      That fire can burn when all the matter's spent;
      Then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see,
      And that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent.
    Thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears,
    When winter snows upon thy sable hairs.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When winter snows upon thy sable hairs,
      And frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near,
      When dark shall seem thy day that never clears,
      And all lies withered that was held so dear;
    Then take this picture which I here present thee,
      Limned with a pencil not all unworthy;
      Here see the gifts that God and nature lent thee,
      Here read thyself and what I suffered for thee.
    This may remain thy lasting monument,
      Which happily posterity may cherish;
      These colours with thy fading are not spent,
      These may remain when thou and I shall perish.
    If they remain, then thou shalt live thereby;
    They will remain, and so thou canst not die.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound
      In feeling hearts than can conceive these lines;
      Though thou a Laura hast no Petrarch found,
      In base attire yet clearly beauty shines.
    And I though born within a colder clime,
      Do feel mine inward heat as great--I know it;
      He never had more faith, although more rhyme;
      I love as well though he could better show it.
    But I may add one feather to thy fame,
      To help her flight throughout the fairest isle;
      And if my pen could more enlarge thy name,
      Then shouldst thou live in an immortal style.
    For though that Laura better limned be,
    Suffice, thou shalt be loved as well as she!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Be not displeased that these my papers should
      Bewray unto the world how fair thou art;
      Or that my wits have showed the best they could
      The chastest flame that ever warmed heart.
    Think not, sweet Delia, this shall be thy shame,
      My muse should sound thy praise with mournful warble.
      How many live, the glory of whose name
      Shall rest in ice, while thine is graved in marble!
    Thou mayst in after ages live esteemed,
      Unburied in these lines, reserved in pureness;
      These shall entomb those eyes, that have redeemed
      Me from the vulgar, thee from all obscureness.
    Although my careful accents never moved thee,
    Yet count it no disgrace that I loved thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Delia, these eyes that so admireth thine,
      Have seen those walls which proud ambition reared
      To check the world, how they entombed have lain
      Within themselves, and on them ploughs have eared;
    Yet never found that barbarous hand attained
      The spoil of fame deserved by virtuous men,
      Whose glorious actions luckily had gained
      Th'eternal annals of a happy pen.
    And therefore grieve not if thy beauties die
      Though time do spoil thee of the fairest veil
      That ever yet covered mortality,
      And must instar the needle and the rail.
    That grace which doth more than inwoman thee,
    Lives in my lines and must eternal be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Most fair and lovely maid, look from the shore,
      See thy Leander striving in these waves,
      Poor soul quite spent, whose force can do no more.
      Now send forth hope, for now calm pity saves,
    And waft him to thee with those lovely eyes,
      A happy convoy to a holy land.
      Now show thy power, and where thy virtue lies;
      To save thine own, stretch out the fairest hand.
    Stretch out the fairest hand, a pledge of peace,
      That hand that darts so right and never misses;
      I shall forget old wrongs, my griefs shall cease;
      And that which gave me wounds, I'll give it kisses.
    Once let the ocean of my care find shore,
    That thou be pleased, and I may sigh no more.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Read in my face a volume of despairs,
      The wailing Iliads of my tragic woe;
      Drawn with my blood, and painted with my cares,
      Wrought by her hand that I have honoured so.
    Who whilst I burn, she sings at my soul's wrack,
      Looking aloft from turret of her pride;
      There my soul's tyrant joys her in the sack
      Of her own seat, whereof I made her guide.
    There do these smokes that from affliction rise,
      Serve as an incense to a cruel dame;
      A sacrifice thrice-grateful to her eyes,
      Because their power serves to exact the same.
    Thus ruins she to satisfy her will,
    The temple where her name was honoured still.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My Delia hath the waters of mine eyes,
      The ready handmaids on her grace t'attend,
      That never fail to ebb, but ever rise;
      For to their flow she never grants an end.
    The ocean never did attend more duly
      Upon his sovereign's course, the night's pale queen,
      Nor paid the impost of his waves more truly,
      Than mine unto her cruelty hath been.
    Yet nought the rock of that hard heart can move,
      Where beat these tears with zeal, and fury drives;
      And yet, I'd rather languish in her love,
      Than I would joy the fairest she that lives.
    And if I find such pleasure to complain,
    What should I do then if I should obtain?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    How long shall I in mine affliction mourn,
      A burden to myself, distressed in mind;
      When shall my interdicted hopes return
      From out despair wherein they live confined?
    When shall her troubled brow charged with disdain
      Reveal the treasure which her smiles impart?
      When shall my faith the happiness attain,
      To break the ice that hath congealed her heart?
    Unto herself, herself my love doth summon,
      (If love in her hath any power to move)
      And let her tell me, as she is a woman,
      Whether my faith hath not deserved her love?
    I know her heart cannot but judge with me,
    Although her eyes my adversaries be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Beauty, sweet love, is like the morning dew,
      Whose short refresh upon the tender green
      Cheers for a time but till the sun doth show,
      And straight 'tis gone as it had never been.
    Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish,
      Short is the glory of the blushing rose,
      The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish,
      Yet which at length thou must be forced to lose.
    When thou, surcharged with burden of thy years,
      Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth,
      And that in beauty's lease expired appears
      The date of age, the kalends of our death,--
    But ah! no more, this must not be foretold,
    For women grieve to think they must be old.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I must not grieve my love, whose eyes would read
      Lines of delight, whereon her youth might smile;
      Flowers have a time before they come to seed,
      And she is young, and now must sport the while.
    Ah sport, sweet maid, in season of these years,
      And learn to gather flowers before they wither.
      And where the sweetest blossoms first appears,
      Let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither.
    Lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air,
      And calm the tempest which my sighs do raise;
      Pity and smiles do best become the fair,
      Pity and smiles shall yield thee lasting praise.
    Make me to say, when all my griefs are gone,
    Happy the heart that sighed for such a one!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Ah whither, poor forsaken, wilt thou go,
      To go from sorrow and thine own distress,
      When every place presents like face of woe,
      And no remove can make thy sorrows less!
    Yet go, forsaken! Leave these woods, these plains,
      Leave her and all, and all for her that leaves
      Thee and thy love forlorn, and both disdains,
      And of both wrongful deems and ill conceives.
    Seek out some place, and see if any place
      Can give the least release unto thy grief;
      Convey thee from the thought of thy disgrace,
      Steal from thyself and be thy cares' own thief.
    But yet what comforts shall I hereby gain?
    Bearing the wound, I needs must feel the pain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Drawn with th'attractive virtue of her eyes,
      My touched heart turns it to that happy coast,
      My joyful north, where all my fortune lies,
      The level of my hopes desired most;
    There where my Delia, fairer than the sun,
      Decked with her youth whereon the world doth smile,
      Joys in that honour which her eyes have won,
      Th'eternal wonder of our happy isle.
    Flourish, fair Albion, glory of the north!
      Neptune's best darling, held between his arms;
      Divided from the world as better worth,
      Kept for himself, defended from all harms!
    Still let disarmed peace deck her and thee;
    And Muse-foe Mars abroad far fostered be!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Care-charmer sleep, son of the sable night,
      Brother to death, in silent darkness born,
      Relieve my languish, and restore the light;
      With dark forgetting of my care return,
    And let the day be time enough to mourn
      The shipwreck of my ill-adventured youth;
      Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,
      Without the torment of the night's untruth.
    Cease, dreams, the images of day-desires,
      To model forth the passions of the morrow;
      Never let rising sun approve you liars,
      To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow;
    Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain,
    And never wake to feel the day's disdain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Let others sing of knights and paladins,
      In aged accents and untimely words,
      Paint shadows in imaginary lines
      Which well the reach of their high wits records;
    But I must sing of thee and those fair eyes
      Authentic shall my verse in time to come,
      When yet th'unborn shall say, Lo, where she lies,
      Whose beauty made him speak that else was dumb!
    These are the arks, the trophies I erect,
      That fortify thy name against old age;
      And these thy sacred virtues must protect
      Against the dark and time's consuming rage.
    Though th'error of my youth in them appear,
    Suffice, they show I lived and loved thee, dear.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    As to the Roman that would free his land,
      His error was his honour and renown;
      And more the fame of his mistaking hand
      Than if he had the tyrant overthrown.
    So Delia, hath mine error made me known,
      And my deceived attempt deserved more fame,
      Than if had the victory mine own,
      And thy hard heart had yielded up the same.
    And so likewise renowned is thy blame;
      Thy cruelty, thy glory; O strange case,
      That errors should be graced that merit shame,
      And sin of frowns bring honour to the face.
    Yet happy Delia that thou wast unkind,
    Though happier far, if thou would'st change thy mind.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Like as the lute delights or else dislikes
      As is his art that plays upon the same,
      So sounds my Muse according as she strikes
      On my heart-strings high tuned unto her fame.
    Her touch doth cause the warble of the sound,
      Which here I yield in lamentable wise,
      A wailing descant on the sweetest ground,
      Whose due reports give honour to her eyes;
    Else harsh my style, untunable my Muse;
      Hoarse sounds the voice that praiseth not her name;
      If any pleasing relish here I use,
      Then judge the world her beauty gives the same.
    For no ground else could make the music such,
    Nor other hand could give so sweet a touch.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    None other fame mine unambitious Muse
      Affected ever but t'eternise thee;
      All other honours do my hopes refuse,
      Which meaner prized and momentary be.
    For God forbid I should my papers blot
      With mercenary lines with servile pen,
      Praising virtues in them that have them not,
      Basely attending on the hopes of men.
    No, no, my verse respects not Thames, nor theatres;
      Nor seeks it to be known unto the great;
      But Avon, poor in fame, and poor in waters,
      Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat.
    Avon shall be my Thames, and she my song;
    No other prouder brooks shall hear my wrong.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Unhappy pen, and ill-accepted lines
      That intimate in vain my chaste desire,
      My chaste desire, which from dark sorrow shines,
      Enkindled by her eyes' celestial fire;
    Celestial fire, and unrespecting powers
      Which pity not the wounds made by their might,
      Showed in these lines, the work of careful hours,
      The sacrifice here offered to her sight.
    But since she weighs them not, this rests for me:
      I'll moan myself, and hide the wrong I have,
      And so content me that her frowns should be
      To m'infant style the cradle and the grave.
    What though my Muse no honour get thereby;
    Each bird sings to herself, and so will I.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Lo here the impost of a faith entire,
      That love doth pay, and her disdain extorts;
      Behold the message of a chaste desire
      That tells the world how much my grief imports.
    These tributary passions, beauty's due,
      I send those eyes, the cabinets of love;
      That cruelty herself might grieve to view
      Th'affliction her unkind disdain doth move.
    And how I live, cast down from off all mirth,
      Pensive, alone, only but with despair;
      My joys abortive perish in their birth,
      My griefs long-lived and care succeeding care.
    This is my state, and Delia's heart is such;
    I say no more, I fear I said too much.

TITLE Idea Sonnet Cycle

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Into these loves who but for passion looks,
    At this first sight here let him lay them by,
    And seek elsewhere in turning other books,
    Which better may his labour satisfy.
      No far-fetched sigh shall ever wound my breast;
    Love from mine eye a tear shall never wring;
    Nor in "Ah me's!" my whining sonnets drest,
    A libertine fantasticly I sing.
      My verse is the true image of my mind,
    Ever in motion, still desiring change;
    To choice of all variety inclined,
    And in all humours sportively I range.
      My muse is rightly of the English strain,
      That cannot long one fashion entertain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Like an adventurous sea-farer am I,
    Who hath some long and dang'rous voyage been,
    And called to tell of his discovery,
    How far he sailed, what countries he had seen,
      Proceeding from the port whence he put forth,
    Shows by his compass how his course he steered,
    When east, when west, when south, and when by north,
    As how the pole to every place was reared,
      What capes he doubled, of what continent,
    The gulfs and straits that strangely he had past,
    Where most becalmed, where with foul weather spent,
    And on what rocks in peril to be cast:
      Thus in my love, time calls me to relate
      My tedious travels and oft-varying fate.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My heart was slain, and none but you and I;
    Who should I think the murder should commit?
    Since but yourself there was no creature by
    But only I, guiltless of murdering it.
      It slew itself; the verdict on the view
    Do quit the dead, and me not accessary.
    Well, well, I fear it will be proved by you,
    The evidence so great a proof doth carry.
      But O see, see, we need inquire no further!
    Upon your lips the scarlet drops are found,
    And in your eye the boy that did the murder,
    Your cheeks yet pale since first he gave the wound!
      By this I see, however things be past,
      Yet heaven will still have murder out at last.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Taking my pen, with words to cast my woe,
    Duly to count the sum of all my cares,
    I find my griefs innumerable grow,
    The reck'nings rise to millions of despairs.
      And thus dividing of my fatal hours,
    The payments of my love I read and cross;
    Subtracting, set my sweets unto my sours,
    My joys' arrearage leads me to my loss.
      And thus mine eyes a debtor to thine eye,
    Which by extortion gaineth all their looks,
    My heart hath paid such grievous usury,
    That all their wealth lies in thy beauty's books.
      And all is thine which hath been due to me,
      And I a bankrupt, quite undone by thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Bright star of beauty, on whose eyelids sit
    A thousand nymph-like and enamoured graces,
    The goddesses of memory and wit,
    Which there in order take their several places;
      In whose dear bosom, sweet delicious love
    Lays down his quiver which he once did bear,
    Since he that blessed paradise did prove,
    And leaves his mother's lap to sport him there
      Let others strive to entertain with words
    My soul is of a braver mettle made;
    I hold that vile which vulgar wit affords;
    In me's that faith which time cannot invade.
      Let what I praise be still made good by you;
      Be you most worthy whilst I am most true!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Nothing but "No!" and "I!"[A] and "I!" and "No!"
    "How falls it out so strangely?" you reply.
    I tell ye, Fair, I'll not be answered so,
    With this affirming "No!" denying "I!"
    I say "I love!" You slightly answer "I!"
    I say "You love!" You pule me out a "No!"
    I say "I die!" You echo me with "I!"
    "Save me!" I cry; you sigh me out a "No!"
    Must woe and I have naught but "No!" and "I!"?
    No "I!" am I, if I no more can have.
    Answer no more; with silence make reply,
    And let me take myself what I do crave;
      Let "No!" and "I!" with I and you be so,
      Then answer "No!" and "I!" and "I!" and "No!"

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    How many paltry, foolish, painted things,
    That now in coaches trouble every street,
    Shall be forgotten, whom no poet sings,
    Ere they be well wrapped in their winding sheet!
      Where I to thee eternity shall give,
    When nothing else remaineth of these days,
    And queens hereafter shall be glad to live
    Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise;
      Virgins and matrons reading these my rhymes,
    Shall be so much delighted with thy story,
    That they shall grieve they lived not in these times,
    To have seen thee, their sex's only glory.
      So shalt thou fly above the vulgar throng,
      Still to survive in my immortal song.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Love, in a humour, played the prodigal,
    And bade my senses to a solemn feast;
    Yet more to grace the company withal,
    Invites my heart to be the chiefest guest.
      No other drink would serve this glutton's turn,
    But precious tears distilling from mine eyne,
    Which with my sighs this epicure doth burn,
    Quaffing carouses in this costly wine;
      Where, in his cups, o'ercome with foul excess,
    Straightways he plays a swaggering ruffian's part,
    And at the banquet in his drunkenness,
    Slew his dear friend, my kind and truest heart.
      A gentle warning, friends, thus may you see,
      What 'tis to keep a drunkard company!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    There's nothing grieves me but that age should haste,
    That in my days I may not see thee old;
    That where those two clear sparkling eyes are placed,
    Only two loopholes that I might behold;
      That lovely arched ivory-polished brow
    Defaced with wrinkles, that I might but see;
    Thy dainty hair, so curled and crisped now,
    Like grizzled moss upon some aged tree;
      Thy cheek now flush with roses, sunk and lean;
    Thy lips, with age as any wafer thin!
    Thy pearly teeth out of thy head so clean,
    That when thou feed'st thy nose shall touch thy chin!
      These lines that now thou scornst, which should delight thee,
      Then would I make thee read but to despite thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    As other men, so I myself do muse
    Why in this sort I wrest invention so,
    And why these giddy metaphors I use,
    Leaving the path the greater part do go.
      I will resolve you. I'm a lunatic;
    And ever this in madmen you shall find,
    What they last thought of when the brain grew sick,
    In most distraction they keep that in mind.
      Thus talking idly in this bedlam fit,
    Reason and I, you must conceive, are twain;
    'Tis nine years now since first I lost my wit.
    Bear with me then though troubled be my brain.
      With diet and correction men distraught,
      Not too far past, may to their wits be brought.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    To nothing fitter can I thee compare
    Than to the son of some rich penny-father,
    Who having now brought on his end with care,
    Leaves to his son all he had heaped together.
      This new rich novice, lavish of his chest,
    To one man gives, doth on another spend;
    Then here he riots; yet amongst the rest,
    Haps to lend some to one true honest friend.
      Thy gifts thou in obscurity dost waste:
    False friends, thy kindness born but to deceive thee;
    Thy love that is on the unworthy placed;
    Time hath thy beauty which with age will leave thee.
      Only that little which to me was lent,
      I give thee back when all the rest is spent.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    You're not alone when you are still alone;
    O God! from you that I could private be!
    Since you one were, I never since was one;
    Since you in me, myself since out of me.
      Transported from myself into your being,
    Though either distant, present yet to either;
    Senseless with too much joy, each other seeing;
    And only absent when we are together.
      Give me my self, and take your self again!
    Devise some means but how I may forsake you!
    So much is mine that doth with you remain,
    That taking what is mine, with me I take you.
      You do bewitch me! O that I could fly
      From my self you, or from your own self I!

      That learned Father which so firmly proves
      The soul of man immortal and divine,
      And doth the several offices define
      _Anima._       Gives her that name, as she the body moves.
      _Amor._        Then is she love, embracing charity.
      _Animus._      Moving a will in us, it is the mind;
      _Mens._        Retaining knowledge, still the same in kind.
      _Memoria._     As intellectual, it is memory.
      _Ratio._       In judging, reason only is her name.
      _Sensus._      In speedy apprehension, it is sense.
      _Conscientia._ In right and wrong they call her conscience;
      _Spiritus._    The spirit, when it to God-ward doth inflame:
      These of the soul the several functions be,
      Which my heart lightened by thy love doth see.

    Letters and lines we see are soon defaced
      Metals do waste and fret with canker's rust,
      The diamond shall once consume to dust,
    And freshest colours with foul stains disgraced;
    Paper and ink can paint but naked words,
      To write with blood of force offends the sight;
      And if with tears, I find them all too light,
    And sighs and signs a silly hope affords.
    O sweetest shadow, how thou serv'st my turn!
      Which still shalt be as long as there is sun,
      Nor whilst the world is never shall be done;
    Whilst moon shall shine or any fire shall burn,
      That everything whence shadow doth proceed,
      May in his shadow my love's story read.

    If he, from heaven that filched that living fire,
      Condemned by Jove to endless torment be,
      I greatly marvel how you still go free
    That far beyond Prometheus did aspire.
    The fire he stole, although of heavenly kind,
      Which from above he craftily did take,
      Of lifeless clods us living men to make
    He did bestow in temper of the mind.
    But you broke into heaven's immortal store,
      Where virtue, honour, wit, and beauty lay;
      Which taking thence, you have escaped away,
    Yet stand as free as e'er you did before.
      Yet old Prometheus punished for his rape;
      Thus poor thieves suffer when the greater 'scape.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Since to obtain thee nothing me will stead,
    I have a med'cine that shall cure my love.
    The powder of her heart dried, when she's dead,
    That gold nor honour ne'er had power to move;
      Mixed with her tears that ne'er her true love crost,
    Nor at fifteen ne'er longed to be a bride;
    Boiled with her sighs, in giving up the ghost,
    That for her late deceased husband died;
      Into the same then let a woman breathe,
    That being chid did never word reply;
    With one thrice married's prayers, that did bequeath
    A legacy to stale virginity.
      If this receipt have not the power to win me,
      Little I'll say, but think the devil's in me!

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

    'Mongst all the creatures in this spacious round
      Of the birds' kind, the phoenix is alone,
      Which best by you of living things is known;
    None like to that, none like to you is found!
    Your beauty is the hot and splend'rous sun;
      The precious spices be your chaste desire,
      Which being kindled by that heavenly fire,
    Your life, so like the phoenix's begun.
    Yourself thus burned in that sacred flame,
      With so rare sweetness all the heavens perfuming;
      Again increasing as you are consuming,
    Only by dying born the very same.
      And winged by fame you to the stars ascend;
      So you of time shall live beyond the end.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

    Stay, speedy time! Behold, before thou pass
      From age to age, what thou hast sought to see,
      One in whom all the excellencies be,
    In whom heaven looks itself as in a glass.
    Time, look thou too in this translucent glass,
      And thy youth past in this pure mirror see!
      As the world's beauty in his infancy,
    What it was then, and thou before it was.
    Pass on and to posterity tell this--
      Yet see thou tell but truly what hath been.
      Say to our nephews that thou once hast seen
    In perfect human shape all heavenly bliss;
      And bid them mourn, nay more, despair with thee,
      That she is gone, her like again to see.

    To this our world, to learning, and to heaven,
      Three nines there are, to every one a nine;
      One number of the earth, the other both divine;
    One woman now makes three odd numbers even.
    Nine orders first of angels be in heaven;
      Nine muses do with learning still frequent:
      These with the gods are ever resident.
    Nine worthy women to the world were given.
    My worthy one to these nine worthies addeth;
      And my fair Muse, one Muse unto the nine.
      And my good angel, in my soul divine!--
    With one more order these nine orders gladdeth.
      My Muse, my worthy, and my angel then
      Makes every one of these three nines a ten.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    You cannot love, my pretty heart, and why?
    There was a time you told me that you would,
    But how again you will the same deny.
    If it might please you, would to God you could!
      What, will you hate? Nay, that you will not neither;
      Nor love, nor hate! How then? What will you do?
    What, will you keep a mean then betwixt either?
    Or will you love me, and yet hate me too?
      Yet serves not this! What next, what other shift?
    You will, and will not; what a coil is here!
    I see your craft, now I perceive your drift,
    And all this while I was mistaken there.
      Your love and hate is this, I now do prove you:
      You love in hate, by hate to make me love you.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    An evil spirit, your beauty, haunts me still,
    Wherewith, alas, I have been long possessed!
    Which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill,
    Nor give me once but one poor minute's rest.
      In me it speaks whether I sleep or wake;
    And when by means to drive it out I try,
    With greater torments then it me doth take,
    And tortures me in most extremity.
      Before my face it lays down my despairs,
    And hastes me on unto a sudden death;
    Now tempting me to drown myself in tears,
    And then in sighing to give up my breath.
      Thus am I still provoked to every evil,
      By this good wicked spirit, sweet angel-devil.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    A witless gallant a young wench that wooed--
    Yet his dull spirit her not one jot could move--
    Intreated me as e'er I wished his good,
    To write him but one sonnet to his love.
      When I as fast as e'er my pen could trot,
    Poured out what first from quick invention came,
    Nor never stood one word thereof to blot;
    Much like his wit that was to use the same.
      But with my verses he his mistress won,
    Who doated on the dolt beyond all measure.
    But see, for you to heaven for phrase I run,
    And ransack all Apollo's golden treasure!
      Yet by my troth, this fool his love obtains,
      And I lose you for all my wit and pains!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    With fools and children good discretion bears;
      Then, honest people, bear with love and me,
      Nor older yet nor wiser made by years,
    Amongst the rest of fools and children be.
      Love, still a baby, plays with gauds and toys,
    And like a wanton sports with every feather,
    And idiots still are running after boys;
    Then fools and children fitt'st to go together.
      He still as young as when he first was born,
    Nor wiser I than when as young as he;
    You that behold us, laugh us not to scorn;
    Give nature thanks you are not such as we!
      Yet fools and children sometimes tell in play;
      Some wise in show, more fools indeed than they.

    Love, banished heaven, in earth was held in scorn,
    Wand'ring abroad in need and beggary;
    And wanting friends, though of a goddess born,
    Yet craved the alms of such as passed by.
      I, like a man devout and charitable,
    Clothed the naked, lodged this wandering guest;
    With sighs and tears still furnishing his table
    With what might make the miserable blest.
      But this ungrateful for my good desert,
    Enticed my thoughts against me to conspire,
    Who gave consent to steal away my heart,
    And set my breast, his lodging, on a fire.
      Well, well, my friends, when beggars grow thus bold,
      No marvel then though charity grow cold.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I hear some say, "This man is not in love!"
    "Who! can he love? a likely thing!" they say.
    "Read but his verse, and it will easily prove!"
    O, judge not rashly, gentle Sir, I pray!
      Because I loosely trifle in this sort,
    As one that fain his sorrows would beguile,
    You now suppose me all this time in sport,
    And please yourself with this conceit the while.
      Ye shallow cens'rers! sometimes, see ye not,
    In greatest perils some men pleasant be,
    Where fame by death is only to be got,
    They resolute! So stands the case with me.
      Where other men in depth of passion cry,
      I laugh at fortune, as in jest to die.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    O, why should nature niggardly restrain
    That foreign nations relish not our tongue?
    Else should my lines glide on the waves of Rhine,
    And crown the Pyren's with my living song.
      But bounded thus, to Scotland get you forth!
    Thence take you wing unto the Orcades!
    There let my verse get glory in the north,
    Making my sighs to thaw the frozen seas.
      And let the bards within that Irish isle,
    To whom my Muse with fiery wings shall pass,
    Call back the stiff-necked rebels from exile,
    And mollify the slaughtering gallow glass;
      And when my flowing numbers they rehearse,
      Let wolves and bears be charmed with my verse.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

    I ever love where never hope appears,
      Yet hope draws on my never-hoping care,
      And my life's hope would die but for despair;
    My never certain joy breeds ever certain fears.
    Uncertain dread gives wings unto my hope;
      Yet my hope's wings are laden so with fear
      As they cannot ascend to my hope's sphere,
    Though fear gives them more than a heavenly scope.
    Yet this large room is bounded with despair,
      So my love is still fettered with vain hope,
      And liberty deprives him of his scope,
    And thus am I imprisoned in the air.
      Then, sweet despair, awhile hold up thy head,
      Or all my hope for sorrow will be dead.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Is not love here as 'tis in other climes,
    And differeth it as do the several nations?
    Or hath it lost the virtue with the times,
    Or in this island alt'reth with the fashions?
      Or have our passions lesser power than theirs,
    Who had less art them lively to express?
    Is nature grown less powerful in their heirs,
    Or in our fathers did she more transgress?
      I am sure my sighs come from a heart as true
    As any man's that memory can boast,
    And my respects and services to you,
    Equal with his that loves his mistress most.
      Or nature must be partial in my cause,
      Or only you do violate her laws.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    To such as say thy love I overprize,
    And do not stick to term my praises folly,
    Against these folks that think themselves so wise,
    I thus oppose my reason's forces wholly:
      Though I give more than well affords my state,
    In which expense the most suppose me vain
    Which yields them nothing at the easiest rate,
    Yet at this price returns me treble gain;
      They value not, unskilful how to use,
    And I give much because I gain thereby.
    I that thus take or they that thus refuse,
    Whether are these deceived then, or I?
      In everything I hold this maxim still,
      The circumstance doth make it good or ill.

    When conquering love did first my heart assail,
    Unto mine aid I summoned every sense,
    Doubting if that proud tyrant should prevail,
    My heart should suffer for mine eyes' offence.
      But he with beauty first corrupted sight,
    My hearing bribed with her tongue's harmony,
    My taste by her sweet lips drawn with delight,
    My smelling won with her breath's spicery,
      But when my touching came to play his part,
    The king of senses, greater than the rest,
    He yields love up the keys unto my heart,
    And tells the others how they should be blest.
      And thus by those of whom I hoped for aid,
      To cruel love my soul was first betrayed.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Those priests which first the vestal fire begun,
    Which might be borrowed from no earthly flame,
    Devised a vessel to receive the sun,
    Being stedfastly opposed to the same;
      Where with sweet wood laid curiously by art,
    On which the sun might by reflection beat,
    Receiving strength for every secret part,
    The fuel kindled with celestial heat.
      Thy blessed eyes, the sun which lights this fire,
    My holy thoughts, they be the vestal flame,
    Thy precious odours be my chaste desires,
    My breast's the vessel which includes the same;
      Thou art my Vesta, thou my goddess art,
      Thy hallowed temple only is my heart.

    Methinks I see some crooked mimic jeer,
    And tax my Muse with this fantastic grace;
    Turning my papers asks, "What have we here?"
    Making withal some filthy antic face.
      I fear no censure nor what thou canst say,
    Nor shall my spirit one jot of vigour lose.
    Think'st thou, my wit shall keep the packhorse way,
    That every dudgeon low invention goes?
      Since sonnets thus in bundles are imprest,
    And every drudge doth dull our satiate ear,
    Think'st thou my love shall in those rags be drest
    That every dowdy, every trull doth wear?
      Up to my pitch no common judgment flies;
      I scorn all earthly dung-bred scarabies.

    Our floods' queen, Thames, for ships and swans is crowned,
    And stately Severn for her shore is praised;
    The crystal Trent for fords and fish renowned,
    And Avon's fame to Albion's cliff is raised.
      Carlegion Chester vaunts her holy Dee;
    York many wonders of her Ouse can tell;
    The Peak, her Dove, whose banks so fertile be;
    And Kent will say her Medway doth excel.
      Cotswold commends her Isis to the Thame;
    Our northern borders boast of Tweed's fair flood;
    Our western parts extol their Wilis' fame;
    And the old Lea brags of the Danish blood.
      Arden's sweet Ankor, let thy glory be,
      That fair Idea only lives by thee!

    Whilst yet mine eyes do surfeit with delight,
    My woful heart imprisoned in my breast,
    Wisheth to be transformed to my sight,
    That it like those by looking might be blest.
      But whilst mine eyes thus greedily do gaze,
    Finding their objects over-soon depart,
    These now the other's happiness do praise,
    Wishing themselves that they had been my heart,
      That eyes were heart, or that the heart were eyes,
    As covetous the other's use to have.
    But finding nature their request denies,
    This to each other mutually they crave;
      That since the one cannot the other be,
      That eyes could think of that my heart could see.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

    Marvel not, love, though I thy power admire,
      Ravished a world beyond the farthest thought,
      And knowing more than ever hath been taught,
    That I am only starved in my desire.
    Marvel not, love, though I thy power admire,
      Aiming at things exceeding all perfection,
      To wisdom's self to minister direction,
    That I am only starved in my desire.
    Marvel not, love, though I thy power admire,
      Though my conceit I further seem to bend
      Than possibly invention can extend,
    And yet am only starved in my desire.
      If thou wilt wonder, here's the wonder, love,
      That this to me doth yet no wonder prove.

    Some misbelieving and profane in love,
      When I do speak of miracles by thee,
      May say that thou art flattered by me,
    Who only write my skill in verse to prove
    See miracles, ye unbelieving, see!
      A dumb-born Muse made to express the mind,
      A cripple hand to write, yet lame by kind,
    One by thy name, the other touching thee.
    Blind were mine eyes, till they were seen of thine;
      And mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be;
      My vices cured by virtues sprung from thee;
    My hopes revived which long in grave had lien.
      All unclean thoughts, foul spirits, cast out in me,
      Only by virtue that proceeds from thee.

    Thou purblind boy, since thou hast been so slack
    To wound her heart whose eyes have wounded me
    And suffered her to glory in my wrack,
    Thus to my aid I lastly conjure thee!
      By hellish Styx, by which the Thund'rer swears,
    By thy fair mother's unavoided power,
    By Hecate's names, by Proserpine's sad tears,
    When she was wrapt to the infernal bower!
      By thine own loved Psyche, by the fires
    Spent on thine altars flaming up to heaven,
    By all true lovers' sighs, vows, and desires,
    By all the wounds that ever thou hast given;
      I conjure thee by all that I have named,
      To make her love, or, Cupid, be thou damned!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Dear, why should you command me to my rest,
    When now the night doth summon all to sleep?
    Methinks this time becometh lovers best;
    Night was ordained together friends to keep.
      How happy are all other living things,
    Which though the day disjoin by several flight,
    The quiet evening yet together brings,
    And each returns unto his love at night!
      O thou that art so courteous else to all,
    Why shouldst thou, Night, abuse me only thus,
    That every creature to his kind dost call,
    And yet 'tis thou dost only sever us?
      Well could I wish it would be ever day,
      If when night comes, you bid me go away.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

    Sitting alone, love bids me go and write;
      Reason plucks back, commanding me to stay,
      Boasting that she doth still direct the way,
    Or else love were unable to indite.
    Love growing angry, vexed at the spleen,
      And scorning reason's maimed argument,
      Straight taxeth reason, wanting to invent
    Where she with love conversing hath not been.
    Reason reproached with this coy disdain,
      Despiteth love, and laugheth at her folly;
      And love contemning reason's reason wholly,
    Thought it in weight too light by many a grain.
      Reason put back doth out of sight remove,
      And love alone picks reason out of love.

    Some, when in rhyme they of their loves do tell,
    With flames and lightnings their exordiums paint.
    Some call on heaven, some invocate on hell,
    And Fates and Furies, with their woes acquaint.
      Elizium is too high a seat for me,
    I will not come in Styx or Phlegethon,
    The thrice-three Muses but too wanton be,
    Like they that lust, I care not, I will none.
      Spiteful Erinnys frights me with her looks,
    My manhood dares not with foul Ate mell,
    I quake to look on Hecate's charming books,
    I still fear bugbears in Apollo's cell.
      I pass not for Minerva, nor Astrea,
      Only I call on my divine Idea!

    My heart the anvil where my thoughts do beat,
    My words the hammers fashioning my desire,
    My breast the forge including all the heat,
    Love is the fuel which maintains the fire;
      My sighs the bellows which the flame increaseth,
    Filling mine ears with noise and nightly groaning;
    Toiling with pain, my labour never ceaseth,
    In grievous passions my woes still bemoaning;
      My eyes with tears against the fire striving,
    Whose scorching gleed my heart to cinders turneth;
    But with those drops the flame again reviving,
    Still more and more it to my torment burneth,
      With Sisyphus thus do I roll the stone,
      And turn the wheel with damned Ixion.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Why do I speak of joy or write of love,
    When my heart is the very den of horror,
    And in my soul the pains of hell I prove,
    With all his torments and infernal terror?
      What should I say? what yet remains to do?
    My brain is dry with weeping all too long;
    My sighs be spent in utt'ring of my woe,
    And I want words wherewith to tell my wrong.
      But still distracted in love's lunacy,
    And bedlam-like thus raving in my grief,
    Now rail upon her hair, then on her eye,
    Now call her goddess, then I call her thief;
      Now I deny her, then I do confess her,
      Now do I curse her, then again I bless her.

    Some men there be which like my method well,
      And much commend the strangeness of my vein;
      Some say I have a passing pleasing strain,
    Some say that in my humour I excel.
    Some who not kindly relish my conceit,
      They say, as poets do, I use to feign,
      And in bare words paint out by passions' pain.
    Thus sundry men their sundry minds repeat.
    I pass not, I, how men affected be,
      Nor who commends or discommends my verse!
      It pleaseth me if I my woes rehearse,
    And in my lines if she my love may see.
      Only my comfort still consists in this,
      Writing her praise I cannot write amiss.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Why should your fair eyes with such sov'reign grace
    Disperse their rays on every vulgar spirit,
    Whilst I in darkness in the self-same place,
    Get not one glance to recompense my merit?
      So doth the plowman gaze the wand'ring star,
    And only rest contented with the light,
    That never learned what constellations are,
    Beyond the bent of his unknowing sight.
      O why should beauty, custom to obey,
    To their gross sense apply herself so ill!
    Would God I were as ignorant as they,
    When I am made unhappy by my skill,
      Only compelled on this poor good to boast!
      Heavens are not kind to them that know them most.

    Whilst thus my pen strives to eternise thee,
    Age rules my lines with wrinkles in my face,
    Where in the map of all my misery
    Is modelled out the world of my disgrace;
      Whilst in despite of tyrannising times,
    Medea-like, I make thee young again,
    Proudly thou scorn'st my world-outwearing rhymes,
    And murther'st virtue with thy coy disdain;
      And though in youth my youth untimely perish,
    To keep thee from oblivion and the grave,
    Ensuing ages yet my rhymes shall cherish,
    Where I intombed my better part shall save;
      And though this earthly body fade and die,
      My name shall mount upon eternity.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Muses which sadly sit about my chair,
    Drowned in the tears extorted by my lines;
    With heavy sighs whilst thus I break the air,
    Painting my passions in these sad designs,
      Since she disdains to bless my happy verse,
    The strong built trophies to her living fame,
    Ever henceforth my bosom be your hearse,
    Wherein the world shall now entomb her name.
      Enclose my music, you poor senseless walls,
    Sith she is deaf and will not hear my moans;
    Soften yourselves with every tear that falls,
    Whilst I like Orpheus sing to trees and stones,
      Which with my plaint seem yet with pity moved,
      Kinder than she whom I so long have loved.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Plain-pathed experience, the unlearned's guide,
    Her simple followers evidently shows
    Sometimes what schoolmen scarcely can decide,
    Nor yet wise reason absolutely knows;
      In making trial of a murder wrought,
    If the vile actors of the heinous deed
    Near the dead body happily be brought,
    Oft 't hath been proved the breathless corse will bleed.
      She coming near, that my poor heart hath slain,
    Long since departed, to the world no more,
    The ancient wounds no longer can contain,
    But fall to bleeding as they did before.
      But what of this? Should she to death be led,
      It furthers justice but helps not the dead.

    In pride of wit, when high desire of fame
    Gave life and courage to my lab'ring pen,
    And first the sound and virtue of my name
    Won grace and credit in the ears of men,
      With those the thronged theatres that press,
    I in the circuit for the laurel strove,
    Where the full praise I freely must confess,
    In heat of blood a modest mind might move;
      With shouts and claps at every little pause,
    When the proud round on every side hath rung,
    Sadly I sit unmoved with the applause,
    As though to me it nothing did belong.
      No public glory vainly I pursue;
      All that I seek is to eternise you.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Cupid, I hate thee, which I'd have thee know;
    A naked starveling ever mayst thou be!
    Poor rogue, go pawn thy fascia and thy bow
    For some poor rags wherewith to cover thee;
      Or if thou'lt not thy archery forbear,
    To some base rustic do thyself prefer,
    And when corn's sown or grown into the ear,
    Practice thy quiver and turn crowkeeper;
      Or being blind, as fittest for the trade,
    Go hire thyself some bungling harper's boy;
    They that are blind are minstrels often made,
    So mayst thou live to thy fair mother's joy;
      That whilst with Mars she holdeth her old way,
      Thou, her blind son, mayst sit by them and play.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Thou leaden brain, which censur'st what I write,
    And sayst my lines be dull and do not move,
    I marvel not thou feel'st not my delight,
    Which never felt'st my fiery touch of love;
      But thou whose pen hath like a packhorse served,
    Whose stomach unto gall hath turned thy food,
    Whose senses like poor prisoners, hunger-starved
    Whose grief hath parched thy body, dried thy blood;
      Thou which hast scorned life and hated death,
    And in a moment, mad, sober, glad, and sorry;
    Thou which hast banned thy thoughts and curst thy birth
    With thousand plagues more than in purgatory;
      Thou thus whose spirit love in his fire refines,
      Come thou and read, admire, applaud my lines!

    As in some countries far remote from hence,
    The wretched creature destined to die,
    Having the judgment due to his offence,
    By surgeons begged, their art on him to try,
      Which on the living work without remorse,
    First make incision on each mastering vein,
    Then staunch the bleeding, then transpierce the corse,
    And with their balms recure the wounds again,
      Then poison and with physic him restore;
    Not that they fear the hopeless man to kill,
    But their experience to increase the more:
    Even so my mistress works upon my ill,
      By curing me and killing me each hour,
      Only to show her beauty's sovereign power.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Calling to mind since first my love begun,
    Th'uncertain times, oft varying in their course,
    How things still unexpectedly have run,
    As't please the Fates by their resistless force;
      Lastly, mine eyes amazedly have seen
    Essex's great fall, Tyrone his peace to gain,
    The quiet end of that long living Queen,
    This King's fair entrance, and our peace with Spain,
      We and the Dutch at length ourselves to sever;
    Thus the world doth and evermore shall reel;
    Yet to my goddess am I constant ever,
    Howe'er blind Fortune turn her giddy wheel;
      Though heaven and earth prove both to me untrue,
      Yet am I still inviolate to you.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    What dost thou mean to cheat me of my heart,
    To take all mine and give me none again?
    Or have thine eyes such magic or that art
    That what they get they ever do retain?
      Play not the tyrant but take some remorse;
    Rebate thy spleen if but for pity's sake;
    Or cruel, if thou can'st not, let us scorse,
    And for one piece of thine my whole heart take.
      But what of pity do I speak to thee,
    Whose breast is proof against complaint or prayer?
    Or can I think what my reward shall be
    From that proud beauty which was my betrayer!
      What talk I of a heart when thou hast none?
      Or if thou hast, it is a flinty one.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Clear Ankor, on whose silver-sanded shore,
    My soul-shrined saint, my fair Idea lives;
    O blessed brook, whose milk-white swans adore
    Thy crystal stream, refined by her eyes,
      Where sweet myrrh-breathing Zephyr in the spring
    Gently distils his nectar-dropping showers,
    Where nightingales in Arden sit and sing
    Amongst the dainty dew-impearled flowers;
      Say thus, fair brook, when thou shalt see thy queen,
    "Lo, here thy shepherd spent his wand'ring years
    And in these shades, dear nymph, he oft hath been;
    And here to thee he sacrificed his tears."
      Fair Arden, thou my Tempe art alone,
      And thou, sweet Ankor, art my Helicon!

    Yet read at last the story of my woe,
    The dreary abstracts of my endless cares,
    With my life's sorrow interlined so,
    Smoked with my sighs, and blotted with my tears,
      The sad memorials of my miseries,
    Penned in the grief of mine afflicted ghost,
    My life's complaint in doleful elegies,
    With so pure love as time could never boast.
      Receive the incense which I offer here,
    By my strong faith ascending to thy fame,
    My zeal, my hope, my vows, my praise, my prayer,
    My soul's oblations to thy sacred name;
      Which name my Muse to highest heavens shall raise,
    By chaste desire, true love, and virtuous praise.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My fair, if thou wilt register my love,
    A world of volumes shall thereof arise;
    Preserve my tears, and thou thyself shall prove
    A second flood down raining from mine eyes;
      Note but my sighs, and thine eyes shall behold
    The sunbeams smothered with immortal smoke;
    And if by thee my prayers may be enrolled,
    They heaven and earth to pity shall provoke.
      Look thou into my breast, and thou shalt see
    Chaste holy vows for my soul's sacrifice,
    That soul, sweet maid, which so hath honoured thee,
    Erecting trophies to thy sacred eyes,
      Those eyes to my heart shining ever bright,
      When darkness hath obscured each other light.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When like an eaglet I first found my love,
    For that the virtue I thereof would know,
    Upon the nest I set it forth to prove
    If it were of that kingly kind or no;
      But it no sooner saw my sun appear,
    But on her rays with open eyes it stood,
    To show that I had hatched it for the air,
    And rightly came from that brave mounting brood;
      And when the plumes were summed with sweet desire,
    To prove the pinions it ascends the skies;
    Do what I could, it needsly would aspire
    To my soul's sun, those two celestial eyes.
      Thus from my breast, where it was bred alone,
      It after thee is like an eaglet flown.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    You best discerned of my mind's inward eyes,
    And yet your graces outwardly divine,
    Whose dear remembrance in my bosom lies,
    Too rich a relic for so poor a shrine;
      You, in whom nature chose herself to view,
    When she her own perfection would admire;
    Bestowing all her excellence on you,
    At whose pure eyes Love lights his hallowed fire;
      Even as a man that in some trance hath seen
    More than his wond'ring utterance can unfold,
    That rapt in spirit in better worlds hath been,
    So must your praise distractedly be told;
      Most of all short when I would show you most,
      In your perfections so much am I lost.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    In former times, such as had store of coin,
    In wars at home or when for conquests bound,
    For fear that some their treasure should purloin,
    Gave it to keep to spirits within the ground;
      And to attend it them as strongly tied
    Till they returned. Home when they never came,
    Such as by art to get the same have tried,
    From the strong spirit by no means force the same.
      Nearer men come, that further flies away,
    Striving to hold it strongly in the deep.
    Ev'n as this spirit, so you alone do play
    With those rich beauties Heav'n gives you to keep;
      Pity so left to th' coldness of your blood,
      Not to avail you nor do others good.

    As Love and I late harboured in one inn,
    With Proverbs thus each other entertain.
    "In love there is no lack," thus I begin:
    "Fair words make fools," replieth he again.
      "Who spares to speak, doth spare to speed," quoth I.
    "As well," saith he, "too forward as too slow."
    "Fortune assists the boldest," I reply.
    "A hasty man," quoth he, "ne'er wanted woe!"
      "Labour is light, where love," quoth I, "doth pay."
    Saith he, "Light burden's heavy, if far born."
    Quoth I, "The main lost, cast the by away!"
      "You have spun a fair thread," he replies in scorn.
      And having thus awhile each other thwarted,
      Fools as we met, so fools again we parted.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Define my weal, and tell the joys of heaven;
    Express my woes and show the pains of hell;
    Declare what fate unlucky stars have given,
    And ask a world upon my life to dwell;
      Make known the faith that fortune could no move,
    Compare my worth with others' base desert,
    Let virtue be the touchstone of my love,
    So may the heavens read wonders in my heart;
      Behold the clouds which have eclipsed my sun,
    And view the crosses which my course do let;
    Tell me, if ever since the world begun
    So fair a rising had so foul a set?
      And see if time, if he would strive to prove,
      Can show a second to so pure a love.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,
    Nay I have done, you get no more of me;
    And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart,
    That thus so cleanly I myself can free;
      Shakes hands for ever, cancel all our vows,
    And when we meet at any time again,
    Be it not seen in either of our brows
    That we one jot of former love retain.
      Now at the last gasp of Love's latest breath,
    When his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies,
    When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death,
    And Innocence is closing up his eyes:
      Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over,
      From death to life thou might'st him yet recover!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When first I ended, then I first began;
    Then more I travelled further from my rest.
    Where most I lost, there most of all I won;
    Pined with hunger, rising from a feast.
      Methinks I fly, yet want I legs to go,
    Wise in conceit, in act a very sot,
    Ravished with joy amidst a hell of woe,
    What most I seem that surest am I not.
      I build my hopes a world above the sky,
    Yet with the mole I creep into the earth;
    In plenty I am starved with penury,
    And yet I surfeit in the greatest dearth.
      I have, I want, despair, and yet desire,
      Burned in a sea of ice, and drowned amidst a fire.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Truce, gentle Love, a parley now I crave,
    Methinks 'tis long since first these wars begun;
    Nor thou, nor I, the better yet can have;
    Bad is the match where neither party won.
      I offer free conditions of fair peace,
    My heart for hostage that it shall remain.
    Discharge our forces, here let malice cease,
    So for my pledge thou give me pledge again.
      Or if no thing but death will serve thy turn,
    Still thirsting for subversion of my state,
    Do what thou canst, raze, massacre, and burn;
    Let the world see the utmost of thy hate;
      I send defiance, since if overthrown,
      Thou vanquishing, the conquest is mine own.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

THINE eyes taught me the alphabet of Love,
To con my cross-row ere I learned to spell
(For I was apt, a scholar like to prove),
Gave me sweet looks when-as I learned well.
Vows were my vowels, when I then begun
At my first lesson in thy sacred name ;
My consonants, the next when I had done,
Words consonant and sounding to thy fame ;
My liquids then were liquid crystal tears,
My cares my mutes, so mute to crave relief ;
My doleful diphthongs were my life's despairs,
Redoubling sighs, the accents of my grief.
    My love's school-mistress now hath taught me so,
    That I can read a story of my woe. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

READING sometime, my sorrows to beguile
I find old poets hills and floods admire ;
One he doth wonder monster-breeding Nile,
Another marvels sulpjur Etna's fire ;
Now broad-brimmed Indus, then of Pindus' height,
Pelion and Ossa, frosty Caucase old ;
The Delian Cynthus, then Olympus' weight,
Slow Arar, frantic Gallus, Cydnus cold ;
Some Ganges, Ister, and of Tagus tell,
Some whirlpool Po and sliding Hypasis,
Some old Parnassus where the Muses dwell,
Some Helicon, and some fair Simois.
    �Ah, fools,� think I, �had you Idea seen,
    Poor brooks and banks had no such wonders been.�

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g

SINCE holy Vestal laws have been neglected,
The God's pure fire hath been extinguished quite ;
No virgin once attending on that light,
Nor yet those heavenly secrets once respected ;
Till thou alone, to pay the heavens their duty
Within the temple of thy sacred name,
With thine eyes kindling that celestial flame
By those reflecting sunbeams of thy beauty.
Here Chastity, that Vestal most divine,
Attends that lamp with eye which never sleepeth ;
The volumes of religion's laws she keepeth,
Making thy breast that sacred relic's shrine,
    Where blessed angels, singing day and night,
    Praise Him which made that fire which lends that light. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

MY fair, look from those turrets of thine eyes
Into the ocean of a troubled mind,
Where my poor soul, the bark of sorrow, lies,
Left to the mercy of the waves and wind.
See where she floats, laden with purest love,
Which those fair islands of thy looks afford,
Desiring yet a thousand deaths to prove,
Than so to cast her ballast overboard.
See how her sails be rent, her tacklings worn,
Her cable broke, her surest anchor lost ;
Her mariners do leave her all forlorn,
Yet how she bends towards that blessed coast !
    Lo, where she drowns in storms of thy displeasure,
    Whose worthy prize should have enriched thy treasure. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

IF chaste and pure devotion of my youth,
Or glory of my April-springing years,
Unfeign�d love in naked simple truth,
A thousand vows, a thousand sighs and tears ;
Or if a world of faithful service done,
Words, thoughts and deeds devoted to her honour,
Or eyes that have beheld her as their sun,
With admiration ever looking on her ;
A life that never joyed but in her love,
A soul that ever hath adored her name,
A faith that time nor fortune could not move,
A Muse that unto heaven hath raised her fame ;
    Though these nor these deserve to be embraced,
    Yet, fair unkind, too good to be disgraced.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

DIE, die, my soul, and never taste of joy,
If sighs nor tears nor vows nor prayers can move,
If faith and zeal be but esteemed a toy,
And kindness be unkindness in my love.
Then with unkindness, Love, revenge thy wrong,
O sweet'st revenge that e'er the heavens gave !
And with the swan record thy dying song,
And praise her still to thy untimely grave.
So in love's death shall love's perfection prove,
That love divine which I have borne to you,
By doom conceal�d to heavens above,
That yet the world unworthy never knew,
    Whose pure idea never tongue exprest :
    I feel, you know, the heavens can tell, the rest. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

BLACK pitchy night, companion of my woe,
The inn of care, the nurse of dreary sorrow,
Why lengthenest thou thy darkest hours so,
Still to prolong my long-time-looked-for morrow ?
Thou sable shadow, image of despair,
Portrait of hell, the air's black mourning weed,
Recorder of revenge, remembrancer of care,
The shadow and the veil of every sinful deed ;
Death like to thee, so live thou still in death,
The grave of joy, prison of day's delight ;
Let heavens withdraw their sweet ambrosian breath,
Nor moon nor stars lend thee their shining light ;
    For thou alone renew'st that old desire,
    Which still torments me in day's burning fire. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

WHO list to praise the day's delicious light,
Let him compare it to her heavenly eye,
The sunbeams to the lustre of her sight ;
So may the learned like the simile,
The morning's crimson to her lips' alike,
The sweet of Eden to her breath's perfume,
The fair Elysium to her fairer cheek,
Unto her veins the only Phoenix' plume,
The angels' tresses to her tress�d hair,
The Galaxeia to her more than white ;
Praising the fairest compare it to my fair,
Still naming her in naming all delight.
    So may he grace all these in her alone,
    Superlative in all comparison. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

GO you, my lines, ambassadors of love,
With my heart's tribute to her conquering eyes,
From whence if you one tear of pity move
For all my woes, that only shall suffice.
When you Minerva in the sun behold,
At her perfections stand you then and gaze,
Where in the compass of a marigold
Meridianis sits within a maze.
And let invention of her beauty vaunt,
When Dorus sings his sweet Pamela's love,
And tell the Gods Mars is predominant,
Seated with Sol, and wears Minerva's glove ;
    And tell the world, that in the world there is
    A heaven on earth, on earth no heaven but this. 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

MANY there be excelling in this kind,
Whose well-tricked rhymes with all invention swell ;
Let each commend as best shall like his mind,
Some Sidney, Constable, some Daniel.
That thus their names familiarly I sing,
Let none think them disparag�d to be ;
Poor men with reverence may speak of a king,
And so may these be spoken of by me.
My wanton verse ne'er keeps one certain stay,
But now at hand, then seeks invention far,
And with each little motion runs astray,
Wild, madding, jocund and irregular.
    Like me that lust, my honest merry rhymes
    Nor care for critic, nor regard the times. 

RHYME a a b b c c c 

EYES, with your tears blind if you be,
Why have these tears such eyes to see ?
Poor eyes, if your tears cannot move,
My tears, eyes, then must moan my love.
    Then, eyes, since you have lost your sight,
    Weep still, and tears shall lend you light,
    Till both dissolved and both want might.

RHYME a a b b c c c 

No, no, clear eyes, you are not blind,
But in my tears discern my mind ;
Tears be the language which you speak,
Which my heart wanting yet, must break.
    My tongue must cease to tell my wrongs,
    And make my sighs to get them tongues ;
    Yet more than this to her belongs.

    A thing so full of pitty as this was,
    Me thinkes for nothing should not slightly passe.
    Treble this losse was, why should it not borrowe,
    Through this Iles treble parts, a treble sorrowe:
    But Fate did this, to let the world to knowe,
    That sorrowes which from common causes growe,

    Some tender-hearted man, as I, may spend
    Some drops (perhaps) for a deceased friend.
    Some men (perhaps) their Wifes late death may rue;
    Or Wifes their Husbands, but such be but fewe.
    Cares that haue vs'd the hearts of men to tuch
    So oft, and deepely, will not now be such;
    Who'll care for loss of maintenance, or place,
    Fame, liberty, or of the Princes grace;

      Through all this Ile their losse so publique is,
    That euery man doth take them to be his,

    Inuention, oft that Passion vs'd to faine,
    In sorrowes of themselves but slight, and meane,
    To make them seeme great, here it shall not need,

    The vtmost teares that sorrowe had to drawe
    All future times hath vtterly preuented
    Of a more losse, or more to be lamented.
      Whilst in faire youth they liuely flourish'd here,
    To their kinde Parents they were onely deere:
    But being dead, now euery one doth take
    Them for their owne, and doe like sorrowe make:
    As for their owne begot, as they pretended

    In faire discourse with some knowne honest friend,
    I write not to you. Nay, and which is more,
    My powerfull verses striue not to restore,
    What time and sicknesse haue in you impair'd,
    To other ends my Elegie is squar'd.

RHYME a a *

      Your beauty, sweetnesse, and your gracefull parts
    That haue drawne many eyes, wonne many hearts,             
    Of me get little, I am so much man,
    That let them doe their vtmost that they can,
    I will resist their forces: and they be
    Though great to others, yet not so to me.
    The first time I beheld you, I then sawe
    That (in it selfe) which had the power to drawe
    My stayd affection, and thought to allowe
    You some deale of my heart; but you have now
    Got farre into it, and you haue the skill
    (For ought I see) to winne vpon me still.                  

RHYME a a *

      When I doe thinke how brauely you haue borne
    Your many crosses, as in Fortunes scorne,
    And how neglectfull you have seem'd to be,
    Of that which hath seem'd terrible to me,
    I thought you stupid, nor that you had felt
    Those griefes which (often) I haue scene to melt
    Another woman into sighes and teares,
    A thing but seldome in your sexe and yeares,

RHYME a a *

    But when in you I haue perceiu'd agen,
    (Noted by me, more then by other men)                             
    How feeling and how sensible you are
    Of your friends sorrowes, and with how much care
    You seeke to cure them, then my selfe I blame,
    That I your patience should so much misname,
    Which to my vnderstanding maketh knowne
    Who feeles anothers griefe, can feele their owne.
    When straight me thinkes, I heare your patience say,
    Are you the man that studied _Seneca_:
    _Plinies_ most learned letters; and must I
    Read you a Lecture in Philosophie,                          

RHYME a a *

    T'auoid the afflictions that haue vs'd to reach you;

      Of all your sex, yet neuer did I knowe,
    Any that yet so actually could showe
    Such rules for patience, such an easie way,
    That who so sees it, shall be forc'd to say,
    Loe what before seem'd hard to be discern'd,
    Is of this Lady, in an instant learn'd.
    It is heauens will that you should wronged be
    By the malicious, that the world might see                  
    Your Doue-like meekenesse; for had the base scumme,
    The spawne of Fiends, beene in your slander dumbe,

RHYME a a *

    Your vertue then had perish'd, neuer priz'd,
    For that the same you had not exercised;
    And you had lost the Crowne you haue, and glory,
    Nor had you beene the subiect of my Story.
    Whilst they feele Hell, being damned in their hate,
    Their thoughts like Deuils them excruciate,
    Which by your noble suffrings doe torment
    Them with new paines, and giues you this content            
    To see your soule an Innocent, hath suffred,
    And vp to heauen before your eyes be offred:
    Your like we in a burning Glasse may see,
    When the Sunnes rayes therein contracted be
    Bent on some obiect, which is purely white,
    We finde that colour doth dispierce the light,

RHYME a a *

    And stands vntainted: but if it hath got
    Some little sully; or the least small spot,
    Then it soon fiers it; so you still remaine
    Free, because in you they can finde no staine.              
      God doth not loue them least, on whom he layes
    The great'st afflictions; but that he will praise
    Himselfe most in them, and will make them fit,
    Near'st to himselfe who is the Lambe to sit:
    For by that touch, like perfect gold he tries them,
    Who are not his, vntill the world denies them.

RHYME a a *

    And your example may work such effect,
    That it may be the beginning of a Sect
    Of patient women; and that many a day
    All Husbands may for you their Founder pray.                
      Nor is to me your Innocence the lesse,
    In that I see you striue not to suppresse
    Their barbarous malice; but your noble heart
    Prepar'd to act so difficult a part,
    With vnremoued constancie is still
    The same it was, that of your proper ill,

RHYME a a *

    The effect proceeds from your owne selfe the cause,
    Like some iust Prince, who to establish lawes,
    Suffers the breach at his best lou'd to strike,
    To learne the vulgar to endure the like.                    
    You are a Martir thus, nor can you be
    Lesse to the world so valued by me:
    If as you haue begun, you still perseuer
    Be euer good, that I may loue you euer.

As by the easy swelling of her saile,
May at *_Sebastians_ safely set her downe
Where, with her goodnes she may blesse the towne.
  If heauen in iustice would haue plagu'd by thee
Some Pirate, and grimme _Neptune_ thou should'st be
His Executioner, or what is his worse,
The gripple Merchant, borne to be the curse

Of this braue Iland; let them for her sake,
Who to thy safeguard doth her selfe betake,       
Escape vndrown'd, vnwrackt, nay rather let
Them be at ease in some safe harbour set,
Where with much profit they may vent their wealth
That they haue got by villany and stealth,
Rather great _Neptune_, then when thou dost raue,
Thou once shouldst wet her saile but with a waue.
  Or if some proling Rouer shall but dare,
To seize the ship wherein she is to fare,
Let the fell fishes of the Maine appeare,
And tell those Sea-thiefes, that once such they were 0

As they are now, till they assaid to rape
Grape-crowned _Bacchus_ in a striplings shape,
That came aboard them, and would faine haue saild,
To vine-spread *_Naxus_ but that him they faild,
Which he perceiuing, them so monstrous made,
And warnd them how they passengers inuade.
  Ye South and Westerne winds now cease to blow
Autumne is come, there be no flowers to grow,
Yea from that place respire, to which she goes,
And to her sailes should show your selfe but foes,

RHYME a a *

But _Boreas_ and yee Esterne windes arise,
To send her soon to _Spaine_, but be precise,
That in your aide you seeme not still so sterne,
As we a summer should no more discerne,
For till that here againe, I may her see,
It will be winter all the yeare with mee.
  Ye swanne-begotten lonely brother-stars,
So oft auspicious to poore Mariners,
Ye twin-bred lights of louely _Leda's_ brood,
_Ioues_ egge-borne issue smile vpon the flood,    
And in your mild'st aspect doe ye appeare
To be her warrant from all future feare.

And if thou ship that bear'st her, doe proue good,
May neuer time by wormes, consume thy wood
Nor rust thy iron, may thy tacklings last,
Till they for reliques be in temples plac't;
Maist thou be ranged with that mighty Arke,
Wherein iust _Noah_ did all the world imbarque,
With that which after _Troyes_ so famous wracke,
From ten yeares trauell brought _Vlisses_ backe,  
That Argo which to _Colchos_ went from _Greece_,
And in her botome brought the goulden fleece

RHYME a a *

Vnder braue _Iason_; or that same of _Drake_,
Wherein he did his famous voyage make
About the world; or _Candishes_ that went
As far as his, about the Continent.
  And yee milde winds that now I doe implore,
Not once to raise the least sand on the shore,
Nor once on forfait of your selues respire:
When once the time is come of her retire,         
If then it please you, but to doe your due,
What for these windes I did, Ile doe for you;

RHYME a a *

Ile wooe you then, and if that not suffice,
My pen shall prooue you to haue dietyes,
Ile sing your loues in verses that shall flow,
And tell the storyes of your weale and woe,
Ile prooue what profit to the earth you bring,
And how t'is you that welcome in the spring;
Ile raise vp altars to you, as to show,
The time shall be kept holy, when you blow.     
O blessed winds! your will that it may be,
To send health to her, and her home to me.

      My dearely loued friend how oft haue we,
    In winter evenings (meaning to be free,)
    To some well-chosen place vs'd to retire;
    And there with moderate meate, and wine, and fire,
    Haue past the howres contentedly with chat,
    Now talk of this, and then discours'd of that,
    Spoke our owne verses 'twixt our selves, if not
    Other mens lines, which we by chance had got,
    Or some Stage pieces famous long before,
    Of which your happy memory had store;                      
    And I remember you much pleased were,
    Of those who liued long agoe to heare,

RHYME a a *

    As well as of those, of these latter times,
    Who have inricht our language with their rimes,
    And in succession, how still vp they grew,
    Which is the subiect, that I now pursue;
    For from my cradle, (you must know that) I,
    Was still inclin'd to noble Poesie,
    And when that once _Pueriles_ I had read,
    And newly had my _Cato_ construed,                         
    In my small selfe I greatly marueil'd then,
    Amonst all other, what strange kinde of men
    These Poets were; And pleased with the name,
    To my milde Tutor merrily I came,

RHYME a a *

    (For I was then a proper goodly page,
    Much like a Pigmy, scarse ten yeares of age)
    Clasping my slender armes about his thigh.
    O my deare master! cannot you (quoth I)
    Make me a Poet, doe it if you can,
    And you shall see, Ile quickly bee a man,                         
    Who me thus answered smiling, boy quoth he,
    If you'le not play the wag, but I may see
    You ply your learning, I will shortly read
    Some Poets to you; _Phoebus_ be my speed,
    Too't hard went I, when shortly he began,
    And first read to me honest _Mantuan_,

RHYME a a *

    Then _Virgils Eglogues_, being entred thus,
    Me thought I straight had mounted _Pegasus_,
    And in his full Careere could make him stop,
    And bound vpon _Parnassus'_ by-clift top.                   
    I scornd your ballet then though it were done
    And had for Finis, _William Elderton_.
    But soft, in sporting with this childish iest,
    I from my subiect haue too long digrest,

RHYME a a *

    Then to the matter that we tooke in hand,
    _Ioue_ and _Apollo_ for the _Muses_ stand.
      Then noble _Chaucer_, in those former times,
    The first inrich'd our _English_ with his rimes,
    And was the first of ours, that euer brake,
    Into the _Muses_ treasure, and first spake                  
    In weighty numbers, deluing in the Mine
    Of perfect knowledge, which he could refine,
    And coyne for currant, and as much as then
    The _English_ language could expresse to men,
    He made it doe; and by his wondrous skill,
    Gaue vs much light from his abundant quill.

RHYME a a *

      And honest _Gower_, who in respect of him,
    Had only sipt at _Aganippas_ brimme,
    And though in yeares this last was him before,
    Yet fell he far short of the others store.                  
      When after those, foure ages very neare,
    They with the _Muses_ which conuersed, were
    That Princely _Surrey_, early in the time
    Of the Eight _Henry_, who was then the prime
    Of _Englands_ noble youth; with him there came
    _Wyat_; with reuerence whom we still doe name

RHYME a a *

    Amongst our Poets, _Brian_ had a share
    With the two former, which accompted are
    That times best makers, and the authors were
    Of those small poems, which the title beare,                
    Of songs and sonnets, wherein oft they hit
    On many dainty passages of wit.
      _Gascoine_ and _Churchyard_ after them againe
    In the beginning of _Eliza's_ raine,
    Accoumpted were great Meterers many a day,
    But not inspired with braue fier, had they
    Liu'd but a little longer, they had seene,
    Their works before them to have buried beene.
      Graue morrall _Spencer_ after these came on
    Then whom I am perswaded there was none                     

RHYME a a *

    Since the blind _Bard_ his _Iliads_ vp did make,
    Fitter a taske like that to vndertake,
    To set downe boldly, brauely to inuent,
    In all high knowledge, surely excellent.
      The noble _Sidney_ with this last arose,
    That _Heroe_ for numbers, and for Prose.
    That throughly pac'd our language as to show,
    The plenteous _English_ hand in hand might goe
    With _Greek_ or _Latine_, and did first reduce
    Our tongue from _Lillies_ writing then in vse;              
    Talking of Stones, Stars, Plants, of fishes, Flyes,
    Playing with words, and idle Similies,

RHYME a a *

    As th' _English_, Apes and very Zanies be,
    Of euery thing, that they doe heare and see,
    So imitating his ridiculous tricks,
    They spake and writ, all like meere lunatiques.
      Then _Warner_ though his lines were not so trim'd,
    Nor yet his Poem so exactly lim'd
    And neatly ioynted, but the Criticke may
    Easily reprooue him, yet thus let me say;                 
    For my old friend, some passages there be
    In him, which I protest haue taken me,
    With almost wonder, so fine, cleere, and new
    As yet they haue bin equalled by few.

RHYME a a *

      Neat _Marlow_ bathed in the _Thespian_ springs
    Had in him those braue translunary things,
    That the first Poets had, his raptures were,
    All ayre, and fire, which made his verses cleere,
    For that fine madnes still he did retaine,
    Which rightly should possesse a Poets braine.             
      And surely _Nashe_, though he a Proser were
    A branch of Lawrell yet deserues to beare,
    Sharply _Satirick_ was he, and that way
    He went, since that his being, to this day

RHYME a a *

    Few haue attempted, and I surely thinke
    Those wordes shall hardly be set downe with inke;
    Shall scorch and blast, so as his could, where he,
    Would inflict vengeance, and be it said of thee,
    _Shakespeare_, thou hadst as smooth a Comicke vaine,
    Fitting the socke, and in thy naturall braine,        
    As strong conception, and as Cleere a rage,
    As any one that trafiqu'd with the stage.
      Amongst these _Samuel Daniel_, whom if I
    May spake of, but to sensure doe denie,

RHYME a a *

    Onely haue heard some wisemen him rehearse,
    To be too much _Historian_ in verse;
    His rimes were smooth, his meeters well did close
    But yet his maner better fitted prose:
    Next these, learn'd _Johnson_, in this List I bring,
    Who had drunke deepe of the _Pierian_ spring,               
    Whose knowledge did him worthily prefer,
    And long was Lord here of the Theater,
    Who in opinion made our learn'st to sticke,
    Whether in Poems rightly dramatique,

RHYME a a *

    Strong _Seneca_ or _Plautus_, he or they,
    Should beare the Buskin, or the Socke away.
    Others againe here liued in my dayes,
    That haue of vs deserued no lesse praise
    For their translations, then the daintiest wit
    That on _Parnassus_ thinks, he highst doth sit,        
    And for a chaire may mongst the Muses call,
    As the most curious maker of them all;
    As reuerent _Chapman_, who hath brought to vs,
    _Musæus_, _Homer_ and _Hesiodus_
    Out of the Greeke; and by his skill hath reard
    Them to that height, and to our tongue endear'd,
    That were those Poets at this day aliue,
    To see their bookes thus with vs to suruiue,

RHYME a a *

    They would think, hauing neglected them so long,
    They had bin written in the _English_ tongue.          
      And _Siluester_ who from the _French_ more weake,
    Made _Bartas_ of his sixe dayes labour speake
    In naturall _English_, who, had he there stayd,
    He had done well, and neuer had bewraid
    His owne inuention, to haue bin so poore
    Who still wrote lesse, in striuing to write more.
      Then dainty _Sands_ that hath to _English_ done,
    Smooth sliding _Ouid_, and hath made him run
    With so much sweetnesse and vnusuall grace,
    As though the neatnesse of the _English_ pace,         

RHYME a a *

    Should tell the Ietting _Lattine_ that it came
    But slowly after, as though stiff and lame.
      So _Scotland_ sent vs hither, for our owne
    That man, whose name I euer would haue knowne,
    To stand by mine, that most ingenious knight,
    My _Alexander_, to whom in his right,
    I want extreamely, yet in speaking thus
    I doe but shew the loue, that was twixt vs,
    And not his numbers which were braue and hie,
    So like his mind, was his clear Poesie,                
    And my deare _Drummond_ to whom much I owe
    For his much loue, and proud I was to know,
    His poesie, for which two worthy men,
    I _Menstry_ still shall loue, and _Hauthorne-den_.

RHYME a a *

    Then the two _Beamounts_ and my _Browne_ arose,
    My deare companions whom I freely chose
    My bosome friends; and in their seuerall wayes,
    Rightly borne Poets, and in these last dayes,
    Men of much note, and no lesse nobler parts,
    Such as haue freely tould to me their hearts,          
    As I have mine to them; but if you shall
    Say in your knowledge, that these be not all
    Haue writ in numbers, be inform'd that I
    Only my selfe, to these few men doe tye,
    Whose works oft printed, set on euery post,
    To publique censure subiect haue bin most;

RHYME a a *

    For such whose poems, be they nere so rare,
    In priuate chambers, that incloistered are,
    And by transcription daintyly must goe;
    As though the world vnworthy were to know,             
    Their rich composures, let those men that keepe
    These wonderous reliques in their iudgement deepe;
    And cry them vp so, let such Peeces bee
    Spoke of by those that shall come after me,

RHYME a a *

    I passe not for them: nor doe meane to run,
    In quest of these, that them applause haue wonne,
    Vpon our Stages in these latter dayes,
    That are so many, let them haue their bayes
    That doe deserue it; let those wits that haunt
    Those publique circuits, let them freely chaunt           
    Their fine Composures, and their praise pursue
    And so my deare friend, for this time adue.

    Past all degrees that was so deare to me;
    As but comparing him with others, hee

    Yet I by this in little time am growne

    To finde some one plague, that might me subuert,
    And at an instant breake my stubborne heart;
    They did indeede, and onely to this end
    They tooke from me this more then man, or friend.
      Hard-hearted Fates, your worst thus haue you done,

      Me thinks that man (vnhappy though he be)
    Is now thrice happy in respect of me,

    As doe the Angels, and doe here belowe
    Take the fruition of that endlesse blisse,
    As those aboue doe, and what each one is.
    They see diuinely, and as those there doe,
    They know each others wills, so soules can too.
      About that dismall time, thy spirit hence flew,
    Mine much was troubled, but why, I not knew,

    In dull and sleepy sounds, it often left me,
    As of it selfe it ment to haue bereft me,
    I asked it what the cause was, of such woe,
    Or what it might be, that might vexe it so,
    But it was deafe, nor my demand would here,
    But when that ill newes came, to touch mine eare,
    I straightwayes found this watchfull sperit of mine,
    Troubled had bin to take it leaue of thine,
    For when fate found, what nature late had done,
    How much from heauen, she for the earth had won             
    By thy deare birth; said, that it could not be
    In so yong yeares, what it perceiu'd in thee,
    But nature sure, had fram'd thee long before;
    And as Rich Misers of their mighty store,

    Keepe the most precious longst, so from times past,
    She onely had reserued thee till the last;
    So did thy wisedome, not thy youth behold,
    And tooke thee hence, in thinking thou wast old.
    Thy shape and beauty often haue to me
    Bin highly praysed, which I thought might be,               
    Truely reported, for a spirit so braue,
    Which heauen to thee so bountifully gaue;
    Nature could not in recompence againe,
    In some rich lodging but to entertaine.
    Let not the world report then, that the Peake,
    Is but a rude place only vast and bleake;

RHYME a a *

    And nothing hath to boast of but her Lead,
    When she can say that happily she bred
    Thee, and when she shall of her wonders tell
    Wherein she doth all other Tracts excell,                   
    Let her account thee greatst, and still to time
    Of all the rest, accord thee for the prime.

      My noble friend, you challenge me to write
    To you in verse, and often you recite,
    My promise to you, and to send you newes;
    As 'tis a thing I very seldome vse,
    And I must write of State, if to _Madrid_,
    A thing our Proclamations here forbid,
    And that word State such Latitude doth beare,
    As it may make me very well to feare
    To write, nay speake at all, these let you know
    Your power on me, yet not that I will showe                

RHYME a a *

    The loue I beare you, in that lofty height,
    So cleere expression, or such words of weight,
    As into _Spanish_ if they were translated,
    Might make the Poets of that Realme amated;
    Yet these my least were, but that you extort
    These numbers from me, when I should report
    In home-spunne prose, in good plaine honest words
    The newes our wofull _England_ vs affords.
      The Muses here sit sad, and mute the while
    A sort of swine vnseasonably defile                        
    Those sacred springs, which from the by-clift hill
    Dropt their pure _Nectar_ into euery quill;

    In this with State, I hope I doe not deale,
    This onely tends the Muses common-weale.
      What canst thou hope, or looke for from his pen,
    Who liues with beasts, though in the shapes of men,
    And what a poore few are we honest still,
    And dare to be so, when all the world is ill.
      I finde this age of our markt with this Fate,
    That honest men are still precipitate                             
    Vnder base villaines, which till th' earth can vent
    This her last brood, and wholly hath them spent,

    But that shall I not see, neither will I
    Maintaine this, as one doth a Prophesie,
    That our King _Iames_ to _Rome_ shall surely goe,
    And from his chaire the _Pope_ shall ouerthrow.
    But O this world is so giuen vp to hell,
    That as the old Giants, which did once rebell,              
    Against the Gods, so this now-liuing race
    Dare sin, yet stand, and Ieere heauen in the face.
      But soft my Muse, and make a little stay,
    Surely thou art not rightly in thy way,

    To write, and see, I suddainely am out,

    This is pure _Satire_, that thou speak'st, and I

    For all this world, yet will I not beleeue
    But that shees faire and louely, and that she
    So to the period of the world shall be;
    Else had she beene forsaken (sure) of all,
    For that so many sundry mischiefes fall

    Can doe her most disgrace, him they alow
    The times chiefe Champion, and he is the man,
    The prize, and Palme that absolutely wanne,
    For where Kings Clossets her free seat hath bin
    She neere the Lodge, not suffered is to Inne,
    For ignorance against her stands in state,
    Like some great porter at a Pallace gate;

    In little time, which I haue hope to see
    Vpon their foot-clothes, as the streets they ride
    To haue their hornebookes at their girdles ti'd.
    But all their superfluity of spite
    On vertues hand-maid Poesy doth light,

    For now as _Elegiack_ I bewaile
    These poor base times; then suddainely I raile

TITLE 

RHYME a a *

  In days of old, there lived, of mighty fame,
  A valiant prince, and Theseus was his name:
  A chief, who more in feats of arms excell'd,
  The rising nor the setting sun beheld.
  Of Athens he was lord; much land he won,
  And added foreign countries to his crown.
  In Scythia with the warrior queen he strove,
  Whom first by force he conquer'd, then by love;
  He brought in triumph back the beauteous dame,
  With whom her sister, fair Emilia, came.                  

RHYME a a a

  With honour to his home let Theseus ride,
  With love to friend, and fortune for his guide,
  And his victorious army at his side.

RHYME a a *

  I pass their warlike pomp, their proud array,
  Their shouts, their songs, their welcome on the way.

RHYME a a a
 
 But, were it not too long, I would recite
  The feats of Amazons, the fatal fight
  Betwixt the hardy queen and hero knight;

RHYME a a *

  The town besieged, and how much blood it cost
  The female army, and the Athenian host;                   
  The spousals of Hippolita the queen;
  What tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen;
  The storm at their return, the ladies' fear:
  But these, and other things, I must forbear.
  The field is spacious I design to sow,
  With oxen far unfit to draw the plough:
  The remnant of my tale is of a length
  To tire your patience, and to waste my strength;
  And trivial accidents shall be forborne,
  That others may have time to take their turn;             

RHYME a a a

  As was at first enjoin'd us by mine host:
  That he whose tale is best, and pleases most,
  Should win his supper at our common cost.

RHYME a a a

    And therefore where I left, I will pursue
  This ancient story, whether false or true,
  In hope it may be mended with a new.

RHYME a a *

  The prince I mention'd, full of high renown,
  In this array drew near the Athenian town;
  When in his pomp and utmost of his pride,
  Marching he chanced to cast his eye aside,                
  And saw a choir of mourning dames, who lay
  By two and two across the common way:
  At his approach they raised a rueful cry,
  And beat their breasts, and held their hands on high,
  Creeping and crying, till they seized at last
  His courser's bridle, and his feet embraced.
  Tell me, said Theseus, what and whence you are,
  And why this funeral pageant you prepare?
  Is this the welcome of my worthy deeds,
  To meet my triumph in ill-omen'd weeds?                   
  Or envy you my praise, and would destroy
  With grief my pleasures, and pollute my joy?
  Or are you injured, and demand relief?
  Name your request, and I will ease your grief.

RHYME a a *

    The most in years of all the mourning train
  Began; but swooned first away for pain,
  Then scarce recover'd spoke: Nor envy we
  Thy great renown, nor grudge thy victory;
  'Tis thine, O king, the afflicted to redress,
  And fame has fill'd the world with thy success:           
  We wretched women sue for that alone,
  Which of thy goodness is refused to none;
  Let fall some drops of pity on our grief,
  If what we beg be just, and we deserve relief:
  For none of us, who now thy grace implore,
  But held the rank of sovereign queen before;
  Till, thanks to giddy chance, which never bears,
  That mortal bliss should last for length of years,
  She cast us headlong from our high estate,
  And here in hope of thy return we wait:                   
  And long have waited in the temple nigh,
  Built to the gracious goddess Clemency.
  But reverence thou the Power whose name it bears,
  Relieve the oppress'd, and wipe the widow's tears.
  
RHYME a a *

I, wretched I, have other fortune seen,
  The wife of Capaneus, and once a queen:
  At Thebes he fell; cursed be the fatal day!
  And all the rest thou seest in this array,
  To make their moan, their lords in battle lost
  Before that town besieged by our confederate host:        
  But Creon, old and impious, who commands
  The Theban city, and usurps the lands,
  Denies the rites of funeral fires to those
  Whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes.
  Unburn'd, unburied, on a heap they lie;
  Such is their fate, and such his tyranny;
  No friend has leave to bear away the dead,
  But with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed.
  At this she shriek'd aloud; the mournful train
  Echoed her grief, and grovelling on the plain,            
  With groans, and hands upheld, to move his mind,
  Besought his pity to their helpless kind!

RHYME a a *

    The prince was touch'd, his tears began to flow,
  And, as his tender heart would break in two,
  He sigh'd, and could not but their fate deplore,
  So wretched now, so fortunate before.
  Then lightly from his lofty steed he flew,
  And, raising one by one the suppliant crew,
  To comfort each full solemnly he swore,
  That by the faith which knights to knighthood bore, 
  And whate'er else to chivalry belongs,
  He would not cease, till he revenged their wrongs:
  That Greece should see perform'd what he declared;
  And cruel Creon find his just reward.

RHYME a a *

  He said no more, but, shunning all delay,
  Rode on; nor enter'd Athens on his way:
  But left his sister and his queen behind,
  And waved his royal banner in the wind:
  Where in an argent field the god of war
  Was drawn triumphant on his iron car;               

RHYME a a *

  Red was his sword, and shield, and whole attire,
  And all the godhead seem'd to glow with fire;
  Even the ground glitter'd where the standard flew,
  And the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue.
  High on his pointed lance his pennon bore
  His Cretan fight, the conquer'd Minotaur:
  The soldiers shout around with generous rage,
  And in that victory their own presage.
  He praised their ardour: inly pleased to see
  His host the flower of Grecian chivalry,            

RHYME a a *

  All day he march'd, and all the ensuing night,
  And saw the city with returning light.
  The process of the war I need not tell,
  How Theseus conquer'd, and how Creon fell:
  Or after, how by storm the walls were won,
  Or how the victor sack'd and burn'd the town:
  How to the ladies he restored again
  The bodies of their lords in battle slain:

RHYME a a *

  And with what ancient rites they were interr'd;
  All these to fitter times shall be deferr'd.        
  I spare the widows' tears, their woeful cries,
  And howling at their husbands' obsequies;
  How Theseus at these funerals did assist,
  And with what gifts the mourning dames dismiss'd.

RHYME a a *

    Thus when the victor chief had Creon slain,
  And conquer'd Thebes, he pitch'd upon the plain
  His mighty camp, and, when the day return'd,
  The country wasted, and the hamlets burn'd,
  And left the pillagers, to rapine bred,
  Without control to strip and spoil the dead.        

RHYME a a *

    There, in a heap of slain, among the rest
  Two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppress'd
  Of slaughter'd foes, whom first to death they sent--
  The trophies of their strength, a bloody monument.
  Both fair, and both of royal blood they seem'd,
  Whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deem'd;
  That day in equal arms they fought for fame;
  Their swords, their shields, their surcoats were the same.
  Close by each other laid, they press'd the ground,
  Their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound;
  Nor well alive, nor wholly dead they were,
  But some faint signs of feeble life appear:

RHYME a a *

  The wandering breath was on the wing to part,
  Weak was the pulse, and hardly heaved the heart.
  These two were sisters' sons; and Arcite one
  Much famed in fields, with valiant Palamon.
  From these their costly arms the spoilers rent,
  And softly both convey'd to Theseus' tent:
  Whom, known of Creon's line, and cured with care,
  He to his city sent as prisoners of the war,        
  Hopeless of ransom, and condemn'd to lie
  In durance, doom'd a lingering death to die.

RHYME a a a

  This done, he march'd away with warlike sound,
  And to his Athens turn'd, with laurels crown'd,
  Where happy long he lived, much loved, and more renown'd.

RHYME a a *

  But in a tower, and never to be loosed,
  The woful captive kinsmen are enclosed.
    Thus year by year they pass, and day by day,
  Till once, 'twas on the morn of cheerful May,
  The young Emilia, fairer to be seen                 
  Than the fair lily on the flowery green,
  More fresh than May herself in blossoms new,
  For with the rosy colour strove her hue,
  Waked, as her custom was, before the day,
  To do the observance due to sprightly May:
  For sprightly May commands our youth to keep
  The vigils of her night, and breaks their sluggard sleep;
  Each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves;
  Inspires new flames, revives extinguish'd loves.
  In this remembrance, Emily, ere day,                
  Arose, and dress'd herself in rich array;
  Fresh as the month, and as the morning fair:
  Adown her shoulders fell her length of hair:
  A riband did the braided tresses bind,
  The rest was loose and wanton'd in the wind.
  Aurora had but newly chased the night,
  And purpled o'er the sky with blushing light,

RHYME a a a

  When to the garden walk she took her way,
  To sport and trip along in cool of day,
  And offer maiden vows in honour of the May.         

RHYME a a *

    At every turn, she made a little stand,
  And thrust among the thorns her lily hand
  To draw the rose, and every rose she drew
  She shook the stalk, and brush'd away the dew:
  Then party-colour'd flowers of white and red
  She wove, to make a garland for her head:
  This done, she sung and caroll'd out so clear,
  That men and angels might rejoice to hear:
  Even wondering Philomel forgot to sing;
  And learn'd from her to welcome in the spring.      
  The tower, of which before was mention made,
  Within whose keep the captive knights were laid,
  Built of a large extent, and strong withal,
  Was one partition of the palace wall;
  The garden was enclosed within the square
  Where young Emilia took the morning air.

RHYME a a *

    It happen'd Palamon, the prisoner knight,
  Restless for woe, arose before the light,
  And with his jailer's leave desired to breathe
  An air more wholesome than the damps beneath.       
  This granted, to the tower he took his way,
  Cheer'd with the promise of a glorious day:

RHYME a a a

  Then cast a languishing regard around,
  And saw, with hateful eyes, the temples crown'd
  With golden spires, and all the hostile ground.

RHYME a a *

  He sigh'd, and turn'd his eyes, because he knew
  'Twas but a larger jail he had in view:
  Then look'd below, and from the castle's height
  Beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight:

RHYME a a a

  The garden, which before he had not seen,           
  In spring's new livery clad of white and green,
  Fresh flowers in wide parterres, and shady walks between.

RHYME a a *

  This view'd, but not enjoy'd, with arms across
  He stood, reflecting on his country's loss;
  Himself an object of the public scorn,
  And often wish'd he never had been born.
  At last, for so his destiny required,
  With walking giddy, and with thinking tired,
  He through a little window cast his sight,
  Though thick of bars, that gave a scanty light:     
  But even that glimmering served him to descry
  The inevitable charms of Emily.

RHYME a a *

    Scarce had he seen, but seized with sudden smart,
  Stung to the quick, he felt it at his heart;
  Struck blind with overpowering light he stood,
  Then started back amazed, and cried aloud.

RHYME a a *

    Young Arcite heard; and up he ran with haste,
  To help his friend, and in his arms embraced;
  And ask'd him why he look'd so deadly wan,
  And whence and how his change of cheer began?       
  Or who had done the offence? But if, said he,
  Your grief alone is hard captivity;
  For love of Heaven, with patience undergo
  A cureless ill, since Fate will have it so:
  So stood our horoscope in chains to lie,
  And Saturn in the dungeon of the sky,
  Or other baleful aspect, ruled our birth,
  When all the friendly stars were under earth:
  Whate'er betides, by Destiny 'tis done;
  And better bear like men, than vainly seek to shun. 
  Nor of my bonds, said Palamon again,
  Nor of unhappy planets I complain;
  But when my mortal anguish caused my cry,
  That moment I was hurt through either eye;
 
RHYME a a *

 Pierced with a random shaft, I faint away,
  And perish with insensible decay;
  A glance of some new goddess gave the wound,
  Whom, like Actaeon, unaware I found.

RHYME a a a

  Look how she walks along yon shady space!
  Not Juno moves with more majestic grace;            
  And all the Cyprian queen is in her face.

RHYME a a *

  If thou art Venus (for thy charms confess
  That face was form'd in heaven, nor art thou less
  Disguised in habit, undisguised in shape),
  Oh, help us captives from our chains to 'scape!
  But if our doom be past in bonds to lie
  For life, and in a loathsome dungeon die,
  Then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace,
  And show compassion to the Theban race,
  Oppress'd by tyrant power! While yet he spoke,      
  Arcite on Emily had fix'd his look;

RHYME a a *

  The fatal dart a ready passage found,
  And deep within his heart infix'd the wound:
  So that if Palamon were wounded sore,
  Arcite was hurt as much as he, or more:
  Then from his inmost soul he sigh'd, and said,
  The beauty I behold has struck me dead:
  Unknowingly she strikes; and kills by chance;
  Poison is in her eyes, and death in every glance.
  Oh, I must ask; nor ask alone, but move             
  Her mind to mercy, or must die for love!
  Thus Arcite: and thus Palamon replies,
  (Eager his tone and ardent were his eyes):

RHYME a a a

  Speak'st thou in earnest, or in jesting vein?
  Jesting, said Arcite, suits but ill with pain.
  It suits far worse (said Palamon again,

RHYME a a *

  And bent his brows) with men who honour weigh,
  Their faith to break, their friendship to betray;
  But worst with thee, of noble lineage born,
  My kinsman, and in arms my brother sworn.           
  Have we not plighted each our holy oath,
  That one should be the common good of both;

RHYME a a *

  One soul should both inspire, and neither prove
  His fellow's hindrance in pursuit of love?
  To this before the gods we gave our hands,
  And nothing but our death can break the bands.
  This binds thee, then, to further my design,
  As I am bound by vow to further thine:
  Nor canst, nor dar'st thou, traitor, on the plain
  Appeach my honour, or thine own maintain,           
  Since thou art of my council, and the friend
  Whose faith I trust, and on whose care depend:
  And would'st thou court my lady's love, which I
  Much rather than release would choose to die?
  But thou, false Arcite, never shall obtain
  Thy bad pretence; I told thee first my pain;
  For first my love began ere thine was born:
  Thou as my council, and my brother sworn,
  Art bound to assist my eldership of right,
  Or justly to be deem'd a perjured knight.           

RHYME a a *

    Thus Palamon: but Arcite with disdain
  In haughty language thus replied again:
  Forsworn thyself: the traitor's odious name
  I first return, and then disprove thy claim.
  If love be passion, and that passion nursed
  With strong desires, I loved the lady first.
  Canst thou pretend desire, whom zeal inflamed
  To worship, and a power celestial named?
  Thine was devotion to the blest above,
  I saw the woman and desired her love;               
  First own'd my passion, and to thee commend
  The important secret, as my chosen friend.
  Suppose (which yet I grant not) thy desire
  A moment elder than my rival fire;
  Can chance of seeing first thy title prove?
  And know'st thou not, no law is made for love?
  Law is to things which to free choice relate;
  Love is not in our choice, but in our fate;

RHYME a a *

  Laws are but positive; love's power, we see,
  Is Nature's sanction, and her first decree.         
  Each day we break the bond of human laws
  For love, and vindicate the common cause.
  Laws for defence of civil rights are placed,
  Love throws the fences down, and makes a general waste;
  Maids, widows, wives, without distinction fall;
  The sweeping deluge, love, comes on, and covers all.

RHYME a a a

  If, then, the laws of friendship I transgress,
  I keep the greater, while I break the less;
  And both are mad alike, since neither can possess.

RHYME a a *

  Both hopeless to be ransom'd, never more            
  To see the sun, but as he passes o'er.
    Like AEsop's hounds contending for the bone,
  Each pleaded right, and would be lord alone:
  The fruitless fight continued all the day;
  A cur came by, and snatch'd the prize away.
  As courtiers, therefore, jostle for a grant,
  And when they break their friendship, plead their want;
  So thou, if fortune will thy suit advance,
  Love on, nor envy me my equal chance;
  For I must love, and am resolved to try             
  My fate, or, failing in the adventure, die.

RHYME a a *

    Great was their strife, which hourly was renew'd,
  Till each with mortal hate his rival view'd;
  Now friends no more, nor walking hand in hand;
  But when they met, they made a surly stand;
  And glared like angry lions as they pass'd,
  And wish'd that every look might be their last.

RHYME a a *

    It chanced at length, Pirithous came to attend
  This worthy Theseus, his familiar friend:
  Their love in early infancy began,                  
  And rose as childhood ripen'd into man.

RHYME a a a

  Companions of the war; and loved so well,
  That when one died, as ancient stories tell,
  His fellow to redeem him went to Hell.

RHYME a a *

    But to pursue my tale; to welcome home
  His warlike brother is Pirithous come:
  Arcite of Thebes was known in arms long since,
  And honour'd by this young Thessalian prince.
  Theseus, to gratify his friend and guest,
  Who made our Arcite's freedom his request,          
  Restored to liberty the captive knight,
  But on these hard conditions I recite:
  That if hereafter Arcite should be found
  Within the compass of Athenian ground,
  By day or night, or on whate'er pretence,
  His head should pay the forfeit of the offence.
  To this Pirithous for his friend agreed,
  And on his promise was the prisoner freed.

RHYME a a *

    Unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way,
  At his own peril; for his life must pay.            
  Who now but Arcite mourns his bitter fate,
  Finds his dear purchase, and repents too late?
  What have I gain'd, he said, in prison pent,
  If I but change my bonds for banishment?
  And banish'd from her sight, I suffer more
  In freedom than I felt in bonds before;
  Forced from her presence, and condemn'd to live:
  Unwelcome freedom, and unthank'd reprieve!
 
RHYME a a *

 Heaven is not, but where Emily abides,
  And where she's absent, all is hell besides.        
  Next to my day of birth, was that accursed,
  Which bound my friendship to Pirithous first:
  Had I not known that prince, I still had been
  In bondage, and had still Emilia seen:
  For though I never can her grace deserve,
  'Tis recompence enough to see and serve.
  O Palamon, my kinsman and my friend,
  How much more happy fates thy love attend!
  Thine is the adventure; thine the victory:
  Well has thy fortune turn'd the dice for thee:      
  Thou on that angel's face may'st feed thine eyes,
  In prison, no; but blissful paradise!
  Thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine,
  And lovest at least in love's extremest line.

RHYME a a a

  I mourn in absence, love's eternal night;
  And who can tell but since thou hast her sight,
  And art a comely, young, and valiant knight,

RHYME a a *

  Fortune (a various power) may cease to frown,
  And by some ways unknown thy wishes crown?
  But I, the most forlorn of human kind,              
  Nor help can hope, nor remedy can find;
  But doom'd to drag my loathsome life in care,
  For my reward, must end it in despair.
  Fire, water, air, and earth, and force of fates,
  That governs all, and Heaven that all creates,
  Nor art, nor nature's hand can ease my grief;
  Nothing but death, the wretch's last relief:
  Then farewell youth, and all the joys that dwell,
  With youth and life, and life itself farewell!

RHYME a a *

    But why, alas! do mortal men in vain              
  Of fortune, fate, or Providence complain?
  God gives us what he knows our wants require,
  And better things than those which we desire:
  Some pray for riches; riches they obtain;
  But, watch'd by robbers, for their wealth are slain:
  Some pray from prison to be freed; and come,
  When guilty of their vows, to fall at home;
  Murder'd by those they trusted with their life,
  A favour'd servant, or a bosom wife.

RHYME a a *

  Such dear-bought blessings happen every day,        
  Because we know not for what things to pray.
  Like drunken sots about the street we roam;
  Well knows the sot he has a certain home;
  Yet knows not how to find the uncertain place,
  And blunders on, and staggers every pace.
  Thus all seek happiness; but few can find.
  For far the greater part of men are blind.
  This is my case, who thought our utmost good
  Was in one word of freedom understood:
  The fatal blessing came: from prison free,          
  I starve abroad, and lose the sight of Emily.

RHYME a a *

    Thus Arcite; but if Arcite thus deplore
  His sufferings, Palamon yet suffers more.
  For when he knew his rival freed and gone,
  He swells with wrath; he makes outrageous moan:
  He frets, he fumes, he stares, he stamps the ground;
  The hollow tower with clamours rings around:
  With briny tears he bathed his fetter'd feet,
  And dropp'd all o'er with agony of sweat.
  Alas! he cried, I wretch in prison pine,            
  Too happy rival, while the fruit is thine:

RHYME a a *

  Thou livest at large, thou draw'st thy native air,
  Pleased with thy freedom, proud of my despair:
  Thou may'st, since thou hast youth and courage join'd,
  A sweet behaviour and a solid mind,
  Assemble ours, and all the Theban race,
  To vindicate on Athens thy disgrace;
  And after, by some treaty made, possess
  Fair Emily, the pledge of lasting peace.
  So thine shall be the beauteous prize, while I      
  Must languish in despair, in prison die.
  Thus all the advantage of the strife is thine,
  Thy portion double joys, and double sorrows mine.

RHYME a a *

    The rage of jealousy then fired his soul,
  And his face kindled like a burning coal:
  Now cold despair, succeeding in her stead,
  To livid paleness turns the glowing red.
  His blood, scarce liquid, creeps within his veins,
  Like water which the freezing wind constrains.
  Then thus he said: Eternal Deities,                 
  Who rule the world with absolute decrees,
  And write whatever time shall bring to pass,
  With pens of adamant on plates of brass;
  What! is the race of human kind your care,
  Beyond what all his fellow-creatures are?

RHYME a a *

  He with the rest is liable to pain,
  And like the sheep, his brother-beast, is slain;
  Cold, hunger, prisons, ills without a cure,
  All these he must, and guiltless, oft endure.
  Or does your justice, power, or prescience fail,    
  When the good suffer, and the bad prevail?
  What worse to wretched virtue could befall,
  If fate or giddy fortune govern'd all?
  Nay, worse than other beasts is our estate;
  Them, to pursue their pleasures, you create;
  We, bound by harder laws, must curb our will,
  And your commands, not our desires, fulfil;

RHYME a a *

  Then when the creature is unjustly slain,
  Yet after death, at least, he feels no pain;
  But man, in life surcharged with woe before,        
  Not freed when dead, is doom'd to suffer more.
  A serpent shoots his sting at unaware;
  An ambush'd thief forelays a traveller:
  The man lies murder'd, while the thief and snake,
  One gains the thickets, and one threads the brake.
  This let divines decide; but well I know,
  Just, or unjust, I have my share of woe,
  Through Saturn seated in a luckless place,
  And Juno's wrath, that persecutes my race;
  Or Mars and Venus, in a quartile, move              
  My pangs of jealousy for Arcite's love.

RHYME a a *

    Let Palamon oppress'd in bondage mourn,
  While to his exiled rival we return.
  By this, the sun, declining from his height,
  The day had shorten'd to prolong the night;
  The lengthen'd night gave length of misery
  Both to the captive lover and the free.
  For Palamon in endless prison mourns,
  And Arcite forfeits life if he returns:
  The banish'd never hopes his love to see,           
  Nor hopes the captive lord his liberty.
  'Tis hard to say who suffers greater pains:
  One sees his love, but cannot break his chains:
  One free, and all his motions uncontroll'd,
  Beholds whate'er he would, but what he would behold.
  Judge as you please, for I will haste to tell
  What fortune to the banish'd knight befell.

RHYME a a *

    When Arcite was to Thebes return'd again,
  The loss of her he loved renew'd his pain;
  What could be worse, than never more to see         
  His life, his soul, his charming Emily?
  He raved with all the madness of despair,
  He roar'd, he beat his breast, he tore his hair.
  Dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears,
  For, wanting nourishment, he wanted tears:
  His eye-balls in their hollow sockets sink,
  Bereft of sleep, he loathes his meat and drink.
  He withers at his heart, and looks as wan
  As the pale spectre of a murder'd man:

RHYME a a *

  That pale turns yellow, and his face receives       
  The faded hue of sapless boxen leaves:
  In solitary groves he makes his moan,
  Walks early out, and ever is alone:
  Nor, mix'd in mirth, in youthful pleasures shares,
  But sighs when songs and instruments he hears.

RHYME a a a

  His spirits are so low, his voice is drown'd,
  He hears as from afar, or in a swound,
  Like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound:

RHYME a a *

  Uncomb'd his locks and squalid his attire,
  Unlike the trim of love and gay desire;             
  But full of museful mopings, which presage
  The loss of reason, and conclude in rage.

RHYME a a *

    This when he had endured a year and more,
  Now wholly changed from what he was before,
  It happen'd once, that, slumbering as he lay,
  He dream'd (his dream began at break of day)
  That Hermes o'er his head in air appear'd,
  And with soft words his drooping spirits cheer'd:
  His hat, adorn'd with wings, disclosed the god,
  And in his hand he bore the sleep-compelling rod:   
  Such as he seem'd, when, at his sire's command,
  On Argus' head he laid the snaky wand.
  Arise, he said, to conquering Athens go,
  There fate appoints an end to all thy woe.

RHYME a a *

  The fright awaken'd Arcite with a start,
  Against his bosom bounced his heaving heart;
  But soon he said, with scarce-recover'd breath,
  And thither will I go, to meet my death.
  Sure to be slain; but death is my desire,
  Since in Emilia's sight I shall expire.             
  By chance he spied a mirror while he spoke,
  And gazing there, beheld his alter'd look;
  Wondering, he saw his features and his hue
  So much were changed, that scarce himself he knew.
  A sudden thought then starting in his mind,
  Since I in Arcite cannot Arcite find,
  The world may search in vain with all their eyes,
  But never penetrate through this disguise.
  Thanks to the change which grief and sickness give,
  In low estate I may securely live,                  

RHYME a a *

  And see unknown my mistress day by day.
  He said; and clothed himself in coarse array:
  A labouring hind in show; then forth he went,
  And to the Athenian towers his journey bent:
  One squire attended in the same disguise,
  Made conscious of his master's enterprise.
  Arrived at Athens, soon he came to court,
  Unknown, unquestion'd in that thick resort:
  Proffering for hire his service at the gate,
  To drudge, draw water, and to run or wait.          

RHYME a a *

    So fair befell him, that for little gain
  He served at first Emilia's chamberlain;
  And, watchful all advantages to spy,
  Was still at hand, and in his master's eye;
  And as his bones were big, and sinews strong,
  Refused no toil that could to slaves belong;
  But from deep wells with engines water drew,
  And used his noble hands the wood to hew.
  He pass'd a year at least attending thus
  On Emily, and call'd Philostratus.                  
  But never was there man of his degree
  So much esteem'd, so well beloved as he.
  So gentle of condition was he known,
  That through the court his courtesy was blown:

RHYME a a *

  All think him worthy of a greater place,
  And recommend him to the royal grace;
  That, exercised within a higher sphere,
  His virtues more conspicuous might appear.
  Thus by the general voice was Arcite praised,
  And by great Theseus to high favour raised;         
  Among his menial servants first enroll'd,
  And largely entertain'd with sums of gold:
  Besides what secretly from Thebes was sent,
  Of his own income, and his annual rent:
  This well employ'd, he purchased friends and fame,
  But cautiously conceal'd from whence it came.
  Thus for three years he lived with large increase,
  In arms of honour, and esteem in peace;
  To Theseus' person he was ever near;
  And Theseus for his virtues held him dear.          

TITLE

RHYME a a *

  While Arcite lives in bliss, the story turns
  Where hopeless Palamon in prison mourns.
  For six long years immured, the captive knight
  Had dragg'd his chains, and scarcely seen the light:
  Lost liberty and love at once he bore:
  His prison pain'd him much, his passion more:
  Nor dares he hope his fetters to remove,
  Nor ever wishes to be free from love.

RHYME a a *

    But when the sixth revolving year was run,
  And May within the Twins received the sun,                
  Were it by chance, or forceful destiny,
  Which forms in causes first whate'er shall be,
  Assisted by a friend, one moonless night,
  This Palamon from prison took his flight:
  A pleasant beverage he prepared before
  Of wine and honey, mix'd with added store
  Of opium; to his keeper this he brought,
  Who swallow'd unaware the sleepy draught,
  And snored secure till morn, his senses bound
  In slumber, and in long oblivion drown'd.                 
  Short was the night, and careful Palamon
  Sought the next covert e'er the rising sun.

RHYME a a a

  A thick-spread forest near the city lay,
  To this with lengthen'd strides he took his way,
  (For far he could not fly, and fear'd the day).

RHYME a a a

  Safe from pursuit, he meant to shun the light,
  Till the brown shadows of the friendly night
  To Thebes might favour his intended flight.

RHYME a a *

  When to his country come, his next design
  Was all the Theban race in arms to join,                  
  And war on Theseus, till he lost his life,
  Or won the beauteous Emily to wife.

RHYME a a *

    Thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile,
  To gentle Arcite let us turn our style;
  Who little dreamt how nigh he was to care,
  Till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare.
  The morning lark, the messenger of day,
  Saluted in her song the morning gray;
  And soon the sun arose with beams so bright,
  That all the horizon laugh'd to see the joyous sight:     
  He with his tepid rays the rose renews,
  And licks the drooping leaves, and dries the dews;
  When Arcite left his bed, resolved to pay
  Observance to the month of merry May:
  Forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode,
  That scarcely prints the turf on which he trode:
  At ease he seem'd, and, prancing o'er the plains,
  Turn'd only to the grove his horse's reins,
  The grove I named before; and, lighted there,
  A woodbine garland sought to crown his hair;              
  Then turn'd his face against the rising day,
  And raised his voice to welcome in the May.

RHYME a a *

    For thee, sweet month! the groves green liveries wear,
  If not the first, the fairest of the year:
  For thee the Graces lead the dancing hours,
  And Nature's ready pencil paints the flowers:
  When thy short reign is past, the feverish sun
  The sultry tropic fears, and moves more slowly on.
  So may thy tender blossoms fear no blight,
  Nor goats with venom'd teeth thy tendrils bite,           
  As thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find
  The fragrant greens I seek, my brows to bind.

RHYME a a a

    His vows address'd, within the grove he stray'd,
  Till Fate, or Fortune, near the place convey'd
  His steps where, secret, Palamon was laid.

RHYME a a a

  Full little thought of him the gentle knight,
  Who, flying death, had there conceal'd his flight,
  In brakes and brambles hid, and shunning mortal sight:

RHYME a a *

  And less he knew him for his hated foe,
  But fear'd him as a man he did not know.                  
  But as it has been said of ancient years,
  That fields are full of eyes, and woods have ears;
  For this the wise are ever on their guard,
  For, unforeseen, they say, is unprepared.
  Uncautious Arcite thought himself alone,
  And less than all suspected Palamon,
  Who, listening, heard him, while he search'd the grove,
  And loudly sung his roundelay of love:
  But on the sudden stopp'd, and silent stood,
  As lovers often muse, and change their mood;

RHYME a a *

  Now high as heaven, and then as low as hell;
  Now up, now down, as buckets in a well:
  For Venus, like her day, will change her cheer,
  And seldom shall we see a Friday clear.
  Thus Arcite having sung, with alter'd hue
  Sunk on the ground, and from his bosom drew
  A desperate sigh, accusing Heaven and Fate,
  And angry Juno's unrelenting hate.

RHYME a a a

  Cursed be the day when first I did appear;
  Let it be blotted from the calendar,                      
  Lest it pollute the month, and poison all the year!

RHYME a a *

  Still will the jealous queen pursue our race?
  Cadmus is dead, the Theban city was:

RHYME a a *

  Yet ceases not her hate: for all who come
  From Cadmus are involved in Cadmus' doom.
  I suffer for my blood: unjust decree!
  That punishes another's crime on me.
  In mean estate I serve my mortal foe,
  The man who caused my country's overthrow.

RHYME a a a

  This is not all; for Juno, to my shame,             
  Has forced me to forsake my former name;
  Arcite I was, Philostratus I am.

RHYME a a *

  That side of heaven is all my enemy:
  Mars ruin'd Thebes: his mother ruin'd me.
  Of all the royal race remains but one
  Besides myself, the unhappy Palamon,
  Whom Theseus holds in bonds, and will not free;
  Without a crime, except his kin to me.
  Yet these, and all the rest, I could endure;
  But love's a malady without a cure:                 
  Fierce love has pierced me with his fiery dart;
  He fires within, and hisses at my heart.
  Your eyes, fair Emily, my fate pursue;
  I suffer for the rest, I die for you!
  Of such a goddess no time leaves record,
  Who burn'd the temple where she was adored:
  And let it burn, I never will complain,
  Pleased with my sufferings, if you knew my pain.

RHYME a a *

    At this a sickly qualm his heart assail'd,
  His ears ring inward, and his senses fail'd.        
  No word miss'd Palamon of all he spoke,
  But soon to deadly pale he changed his look:
  He trembled every limb, and felt a smart,
  As if cold steel had glided through his heart;
  No longer staid, but starting from his place,
  Discover'd stood, and show'd his hostile face:
  False traitor, Arcite! traitor to thy blood!
  Bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good,
  Now art thou found forsworn, for Emily;
  And darest attempt her love, for whom I die.        
  So hast thou cheated Theseus with a wile,
  Against thy vow, returning to beguile
  Under a borrow'd name: as false to me,
  So false thou art to him who set thee free.
  But rest assured, that either thou shalt die,
  Or else renounce thy claim in Emily:
  For though unarm'd I am, and (freed by chance)
  Am here without my sword, or pointed lance,
  Hope not, base man, unquestioned hence to go,
  For I am Palamon, thy mortal foe.                   

RHYME a a *

    Arcite, who heard his tale, and knew the man,
  His sword unsheath'd, and fiercely thus began:
  Now by the gods who govern heaven above,
  Wert thou not weak with hunger, mad with love,
  That word had been thy last, or in this grove
  This hand should force thee to renounce thy love.

RHYME a a a

  The surety which I gave thee, I defy:
  Fool, not to know that love endures no tie,
  And Jove but laughs at lovers' perjury.

RHYME a a *

  Know I will serve the fair in thy despite;          
  But since thou art my kinsman, and a knight,
  Here, have my faith, to-morrow in this grove
  Our arms shall plead the titles of our love:
  And Heaven so help my right, as I alone
  Will come, and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown;
  With arms of proof both for myself and thee;
  Choose thou the best, and leave the worst to me.
  And, that at better ease thou may'st abide,
  Bedding and clothes I will this night provide,
  And needful sustenance, that thou may'st be         
  A conquest better won, and worthy me.
  His promise Palamon accepts; but pray'd
  To keep it better than the first he made.
  Thus fair they parted till the morrow's dawn,
  For each had laid his plighted faith to pawn.

RHYME a a a

  Oh, Love! thou sternly dost thy power maintain,
  And wilt not bear a rival in thy reign;
  Tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain!

RHYME a a * 

 This was in Arcite proved, and Palamon,
  Both in despair, yet each would love alone.         
  Arcite return'd, and, as in honour tied,
  His foe with bedding, and with food supplied;
  Then, ere the day, two suits of armour sought,
  Which, borne before him on his steed, he brought:
  Both were of shining steel, and wrought so pure,
  As might the strokes of two such arms endure.
  Now, at the time, and in the appointed place,
  The challenger and challenged, face to face,
  Approach; each other from afar they knew,
  And from afar their hatred changed their hue.       
  So stands the Thracian herdsman with his spear,
  Pull in the gap, and hopes the hunted bear,
  And hears him rustling in the wood, and sees
  His course at distance by the bending trees;
  And thinks, Here comes my mortal enemy,
  And either he must fall in fight, or I:

RHYME a a a

  This while he thinks, he lifts aloft his dart;
  A generous chilness seizes every part:
  The veins pour back the blood, and fortify the heart.

RHYME a a *

    Thus pale they meet; their eyes with fury burn;   
  None greets; for none the greeting will return:
  But in dumb surliness, each arm'd with care
  His foe profess'd, as brother of the war:
  Then both, no moment lost, at once advance
  Against each other, arm'd with sword and lance:
  They lash, they foin, they pass, they strive to bore
  Their corslets and the thinnest parts explore.
  Thus two long hours in equal arms they stood,
  And wounded, wound, till both were bathed in blood;
  And not a foot of ground had either got,            
  As if the world depended on the spot.
  Fell Arcite like an angry tiger fared,
  And like a lion Palamon appear'd:
  Or, as two boars, whom love to battle draws,
  With rising bristles, and with frothy jaws,
  Their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound;
  With grunts and groans the forest rings around.
  So fought the knights, and fighting must abide,
  Till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide.

RHYME a a *

    The power that ministers to God's decrees,        
  And executes on earth what Heaven foresees,
  Call'd providence, or chance, or fatal sway,
  Comes with resistless force, and finds or makes her way.
  Nor kings, nor nations, nor united power,
  One moment can retard the appointed hour;
  And some one day, some wondrous chance appears,
  Which happen'd not in centuries of years:
  For sure, whate'er we mortals hate, or love,
  Or hope, or fear, depends on Powers above;
  They move our appetites to good or ill,             
  And by foresight necessitate the will.
  In Theseus this appears; whose youthful joy
  Was beasts of chase in forests to destroy:

RHYME a a a

  This gentle knight, inspired by jolly May,
  Forsook his easy couch at early day,
  And to the wood and wilds pursued his way.

RHYME a a *

  Beside him rode Hippolita the queen,
  And Emily attired in lively green,
  With horns, and hounds, and all the tuneful cry,
  To hunt a royal hart within the covert nigh:        
  And as he follow'd Mars before, so now
  He serves the goddess of the silver bow.
  The way that Theseus took was to the wood
  Where the two knights in cruel battle stood:
  The lawn on which they fought, the appointed place
  In which the uncoupled hounds began the chase.
  Thither forth-right he rode to rouse the prey,
  That, shaded by the fern, in harbour lay;
  And thence dislodged, was wont to leave the wood
  For open fields, and cross the crystal flood.       
  Approach'd, and looking underneath the sun,
  He saw proud Arcite, and fierce Palamon,
  In mortal battle doubling blow on blow,
  Like lightning flamed their falchions to and fro,
  And shot a dreadful gleam; so strong they strook,
  There seem'd less force required to fell an oak:
  He gazed with wonder on their equal might,
  Look'd eager on, but knew not either knight:
  Resolved to learn, he spurr'd his fiery steed
  With goring rowels to provoke his speed.            
  The minute ended that began the race,
  So soon he was betwixt them on the place;
  And, with his sword unsheath'd, on pain of life
  Commands both combatants to cease their strife:
  Then with imperious tone pursues his threat:
  What are you? why in arms together met?

RHYME a a *

  How dares your pride presume against my laws,
  As in a listed field to fight your cause?
  Unask'd the royal grant; no marshal by,
  As knightly rites require; nor judge to try?        
  Then Palamon, with scarce recover'd breath,
  Thus hasty spoke: We both deserve the death,
  And both would die; for look the world around,
  A pair so wretched is not to be found;
  Our life's a load; encumber'd with the charge,
  We long to set the imprison'd soul at large.

RHYME a a a

  Now, as thou art a sovereign judge, decree
  The rightful doom of death to him and me;
  Let neither find thy grace, for grace is cruelty.

RHYME a a *

  Me first, oh, kill me first, and cure my woe;       
  Then sheath the sword of justice on my foe:
  Or kill him first; for when his name is heard,
  He foremost will receive his due reward.
  Arcite of Thebes is he; thy mortal foe:
  On whom thy grace did liberty bestow,

RHYME a a *

  But first contracted, that if ever found
  By day or night upon the Athenian ground,
  His head should pay the forfeit; see return'd
  The perjured knight, his oath and honour scorn'd.
  For this is he, who, with a borrow'd name           
  And proffer'd service, to thy palace came,

RHYME a a a

  Now call'd Philostratus: retain'd by thee,
  A traitor trusted, and in high degree,
  Aspiring to the bed of beauteous Emily.

RHYME a a *

  My part remains; from Thebes my birth I own,
  And call myself the unhappy Palamon.
  Think me not like that man; since no disgrace
  Can force me to renounce the honour of my race.
  Know me for what I am: I broke my chain,
  Nor promised I thy prisoner to remain:              
  The love of liberty with life is given,
  And life itself the inferior gift of Heaven.
  Thus without crime I fled; but further know,
  I, with this Arcite, am thy mortal foe:
  Then give me death, since I thy life pursue;
  For safeguard of thyself, death is my due.
  More would'st thou know? I love bright Emily,
  And, for her sake, and in her sight will die:

RHYME a a a

  But kill my rival too; for he no less
  Deserves; and I thy righteous doom will bless,      
  Assured that what I lose, he never shall possess.

RHYME a a *

    To this replied the stern Athenian prince,
  And sourly smiled: In owning your offence
  You judge yourself; and I but keep record
  In place of law, while you pronounce the word.
  Take your desert, the death you have decreed;
  I seal your doom, and ratify the deed:
  By Mars, the patron of my arms, you die!
    He said; dumb sorrow seized the standers-by.
  The queen above the rest, by nature good,           
  (The pattern form'd of perfect womanhood)
  For tender pity wept: when she began,
  Through the bright quire the infectious virtue ran.
  All dropt their tears, even the contended maid;
  And thus among themselves they softly said:
  What eyes can suffer this unworthy sight!
  Two youths of royal blood, renown'd in fight,
  The mastership of Heaven in face and mind,
  And lovers, far beyond their faithless kind:
  See their wide streaming wounds; they neither came  
  For pride of empire, nor desire of fame:
  Kings fight for kingdoms, madmen for applause;
  But love for love alone; that crowns the lover's cause.
  This thought, which ever bribes the beauteous kind,
  Such pity wrought in every lady's mind,
  They left their steeds, and, prostrate on the place,
  From the fierce king implored the offenders' grace.

RHYME a a *

    He paused a while, stood silent in his mood
  (For yet his rage was boiling in his blood);
  But soon his tender mind the impression felt,       
  (As softest metals are not slow to melt,
  And pity soonest runs in softest minds):
  Then reasons with himself; and first he finds
  His passion cast a mist before his sense,
  And either made, or magnified the offence.
  Offence! of what? to whom? who judged the cause?
  The prisoner freed himself by nature's laws:
  Born free, he sought his right: the man he freed
  Was perjured, but his love excused the deed.
  Thus pondering, he look'd under with his eyes,      
  And saw the women's tears, and heard their cries;
  Which moved compassion more; he shook his head,
  And, softly sighing, to himself he said:
  Curse on the unpardoning prince, whom tears can draw
  To no remorse; who rules by lions' law;

RHYME a a *

  And deaf to prayers, by no submission bow'd,
  Rends all alike; the penitent, and proud!
  At this, with look serene, he raised his head;
  Reason resumed her place, and passion fled:
  Then thus aloud he spoke: The power of love,        
  In earth, and seas, and air, and heaven above,
  Rules, unresisted, with an awful nod;
  By daily miracles declared a god:
  He blinds the wise, gives eyesight to the blind;
  And moulds and stamps anew the lover's mind.
  Behold that Arcite, and this Palamon,
  Freed from my fetters, and in safety gone,
  What hinder'd either in their native soil
  At ease to reap the harvest of their toil?
  But Love, their lord, did otherwise ordain,         
  And brought them in their own despite again,
  To suffer death deserved; for well they know,
  'Tis in my power, and I their deadly foe.
  The proverb holds, that to be wise and love,
  Is hardly granted to the gods above.

RHYME a a *

  See how the madmen bleed! behold the gains
  With which their master, Love, rewards their pains!
  For seven long years, on duty every day,
  Lo, their obedience, and their monarch's pay:
  Yet, as in duty bound, they serve him on;           
  And, ask the fools, they think it wisely done;
  Nor ease, nor wealth, nor life itself regard,
  For 'tis their maxim, Love is love's reward.
  This is not all; the fair, for whom they strove,
  Nor knew before, nor could suspect their love;
  Nor thought, when she beheld the sight from far,
  Her beauty was the occasion of the war.
  But sure a general doom on man is past,
  And all are fools and lovers, first or last:
  This both by others and myself I know,              
  For I have served their sovereign long ago;

RHYME a a a

  Oft have been caught within the winding train
  Of female snares, and felt the lover's pain,
  And learn'd how far the god can human hearts constrain.

RHYME a a *

  To this remembrance, and the prayers of those
  Who for the offending warriors interpose,
  I give their forfeit lives; on this accord,
  To do me homage as their sovereign lord;
  And, as my vassals, to their utmost might,
  Assist my person, and assert my right.              

RHYME a a *

    This freely sworn, the knights their grace obtain'd;
  Then thus the king his secret thoughts explain'd:
  If wealth, or honour, or a royal race,
  Or each, or all, may win a lady's grace,
  Then either of you knights may well deserve
  A princess born; and such is she you serve:
  For Emily is sister to the crown,
  And but too well to both her beauty known:
  But should you combat till you both were dead,
  Two lovers cannot share a single bed:               
  As, therefore, both are equal in degree,
  The lot of both be left to destiny.
  Now hear the award, and happy may it prove
  To her, and him who best deserves her love.
  Depart from hence in peace, and, free as air,
  Search the wide world, and where you please repair;
  But on the day when this returning sun
  To the same point through every sign has run,

RHYME a a *

  Then each of you his hundred knights shall bring,
  In royal lists, to fight before the king;           
  And then the knight, whom fate or happy chance
  Shall with his friends to victory advance,
  And grace his arms so far in equal fight,
  From out the bars to force his opposite,
  Or kill, or make him recreant on the plain,
  The prize of valour and of love shall gain;
  The vanquish'd party shall their claim release,
  And the long jars conclude in lasting peace.
  The charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground,
  The theatre of war, for champions so renown'd;      

RHYME a a a

  And take the patron's place of either knight,
  With eyes impartial to behold the fight;
  And Heaven of me so judge as I shall judge aright.

RHYME a a *

  If both are satisfied with this accord,
  Swear by the laws of knighthood on my sword.

RHYME a a *

    Who now but Palamon exults with joy?
  And ravish'd Arcite seems to touch the sky:
  The whole assembled troop was pleased as well,
  Extol the award, and on their knees they fell
  To bless the gracious king. The knights, with leave,
  Departing from the place, his last commands receive;
  On Emily with equal ardour look,
  And from her eyes their inspiration took.
  From thence to Thebes' old walls pursue their way,
  Each to provide his champions for the day.

RHYME a a *

    It might be deem'd, on our historian's part,
  Or too much negligence, or want of art,
  If he forgot the vast magnificence
  Of royal Theseus, and his large expense,
  He first enclosed for lists a level ground,         
  The whole circumference a mile around;
  The form was circular; and all without
  A trench was sunk, to moat the place about.
  Within an amphitheatre appear'd,
  Raised in degrees; to sixty paces rear'd:
  That when a man was placed in one degree,
  Height was allow'd for him above to see.

RHYME a a *

    Eastward was built a gate of marble white;
  The like adorn'd the western opposite.
  A nobler object than this fabric was,               
  Rome never saw; nor of so vast a space.
  For rich with spoils of many a conquer'd land,
  All arts and artists Theseus could command;
  Who sold for hire, or wrought for better fame;
  The master-painters, and the carvers came.
  So rose within the compass of the year
  An age's work, a glorious theatre.
  Then o'er its eastern gate was raised above
  A temple, sacred to the Queen of Love;
  An altar stood below: on either hand                
  A priest with roses crown'd, who held a myrtle wand.
    The dome of Mars was on the gate opposed,
  And on the north a turret was enclosed,

RHYME a a a

  Within the wall, of alabaster white,
  And crimson coral, for the Queen of Night,
  Who takes in sylvan sports her chaste delight.

RHYME a a *

    Within these oratories might you see
  Rich carvings, portraitures, and imagery:
  Where every figure to the life express'd
  The godhead's power to whom it was address'd.       
  In Venus' temple on the sides were seen
  The broken slumbers of enamour'd men;
  Prayers that even spoke, and pity seem'd to call,
  And issuing sighs that smoked along the wall;
  Complaints, and hot desires, the lover's hell,
  And scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell:

RHYME a a a

  And all around were nuptial bonds, the ties,
  Of love's assurance, and a train of lies,
  That, made in lust, conclude in perjuries.

RHYME a a *

  Beauty, and Youth, and Wealth, and Luxury,          
  And spritely Hope, and short-enduring Joy;
  And Sorceries to raise the infernal powers,
  And Sigils framed in planetary hours:
  Expense, and After-Thought, and idle Care,
  And Doubts of motley hue, and dark Despair;
  Suspicious, and fantastical Surmise,
  And Jealousy suffused, with jaundice in her eyes,
  Discolouring all she view'd, in tawny dress'd,
  Down-look'd, and with a cuckoo on her fist.
  Opposed to her, on the other side advance           
  The costly feast, the carol, and the dance,

RHYME a a *

  Minstrels and Music, Poetry and Play,
  And balls by night, and tournaments by day.
  All these were painted on the wall, and more;
  With acts and monuments of times before:
  And others added by prophetic doom,
  And lovers yet unborn, and loves to come:
  For there the Idalian mount, and Citheron,
  The court of Venus, was in colours drawn:
  Before the palace-gate, in careless dress,          
  And loose array, sat portress Idleness:

RHYME a a a
 
 There, by the fount, Narcissus pined alone;
  There Samson was; with wiser Solomon,
  And all the mighty names by love undone.

RHYME a a *

  Medea's charms were there, Circean feasts,
  With bowls that turn'd enamour'd youths to beasts:
  Here might be seen, that beauty, wealth, and wit,
  And prowess, to the power of love submit:

RHYME a a *

  The spreading snare for all mankind is laid;
  And lovers all betray, and are betray'd.            
  The goddess self some noble hand had wrought;
  Smiling she seem'd, and full of pleasing thought:
  From ocean as she first began to rise,
  And smooth'd the ruffled seas and clear'd the skies;
  She trode the brine, all bare below the breast,
  And the green waves but ill conceal'd the rest;
  A lute she held; and on her head was seen
  A wreath of roses red, and myrtles green;
  Her turtles fann'd the buxom air above;
  And, by his mother, stood an infant Love,           

RHYME a a a

  With wings unfledged; his eyes were banded o'er;
  His hands a bow, his back a quiver bore,
  Supplied with arrows bright and keen, a deadly store.

RHYME a a *

    But in the dome of mighty Mars the red
  With different figures all the sides were spread;
  This temple, less in form, with equal grace,
  Was imitative of the first in Thrace:
  For that cold region was the loved abode
  And sovereign mansion of the warrior god.
  The landscape was a forest wide and bare;           
  Where neither beast, nor human kind repair;
  The fowl, that scent afar, the borders fly,
  And shun the bitter blast, and wheel about the sky.
  A cake of scurf lies baking on the ground,
  And prickly stubs, instead of trees, are found;
  Or woods, with knots and knares, deform'd and old;
  Headless the most, and hideous to behold:
  A rattling tempest through the branches went,
  That stripp'd them bare, and one sole way they bent.

RHYME a a *

  Heaven froze above, severe, the clouds congeal,     
  And through the crystal vault appear'd the standing hail.
  Such was the face without; a mountain stood
  Threatening from high, and overlook'd the wood:
  Beneath the lowering brow, and on a bent,
  The temple stood of Mars armipotent:
  The frame of burnish'd steel, that cast a glare
  From far, and seem'd to thaw the freezing air.
  A strait long entry to the temple led,
  Blind with high walls; and horror over head:
  Thence issued such a blast, and hollow roar,        
  As threaten'd from the hinge to heave the door:
  In through that door, a northern light there shone;
  'Twas all it had, for windows there were none.
  The gate was adamant; eternal frame!
  Which, hew'd by Mars himself, from Indian quarries came,

RHYME a a *

  The labour of a god; and all along
  Tough iron plates were clench'd to make it strong.
  A tun about was every pillar there;
  A polish'd mirror shone not half so clear.

RHYME a a a

  There saw I how the secret felon wrought,           
  And treason labouring in the traitor's thought;
  And midwife Time the ripen'd plot to murder brought.

RHYME a a *

  There the red Anger dared the pallid Fear;
  Next stood Hypocrisy, with holy leer,
  Soft smiling, and demurely looking down,
  But hid the dagger underneath the gown:
  The assassinating wife, the household fiend;
  And far the blackest there, the traitor-friend.
  On the other side, there stood Destruction bare;
  Unpunish'd Rapine, and a waste of War.              
  Contest, with sharpen'd knives, in cloisters drawn,
  And all with blood bespread the holy lawn.

RHYME a a a

  Loud menaces were heard, and foul disgrace,
  And bawling infamy, in language base;
  Till sense was lost in sound, and silence fled the place.

RHYME a a *

  The slayer of himself yet saw I there,
  The gore congeal'd was clotted in his hair;
  With eyes half closed, and gaping mouth he lay,
  And grim, as when he breathed his sullen soul away.
  In midst of all the dome, Misfortune sate,          
  And gloomy Discontent, and fell Debate,
  And Madness laughing in his ireful mood;
  And arm'd complaint on theft; and cries of blood.
  There was the murder'd corpse in covert laid,
  And violent death in thousand shapes display'd:
  The city to the soldiers rage resigned:
  Successless wars, and poverty behind:
  Ships burnt in fight, or forced on rocky shores,
  And the rash hunter strangled by the boars:
  The new-born babe by nurses overlaid;               
  And the cook caught within the raging fire he made.
  All ills of Mars his nature, flame and steel;
  The gasping charioteer, beneath the wheel

RHYME a a *

  Of his own car; the ruin'd house that falls
  And intercepts her lord betwixt the walls:
  The whole division that to Mars pertains,
  All trades of death that deal in steel for gains,
  Were there: the butcher, armourer, and smith,
  Whose forges sharpen'd falchions, or the scythe.
  The scarlet conquest on a tower was placed,         
  With shouts, and soldiers' acclamations graced:
  A pointed sword hung threatening o'er his head,
  Sustain'd but by a slender twine of thread.
  There saw I Mars his ides, the Capitol,
  The seer in vain foretelling Caesar's fall;
  The last triumvirs, and the wars they move,
  And Antony, who lost the world for love.
  These, and a thousand more, the fane adorn;
  Their fates were painted ere the men were born,
  All copied from the heavens, and ruling force       
  Of the red star, in his revolving course.
  The form of Mars high on a chariot stood,
  All sheath'd in arms, and gruffly look'd the god:
  
RHYME a a a

Two geomantic figures were display'd
  Above his head, a warrior and a maid,
  One when direct, and one when retrograde.

RHYME a a *

    Tired with deformities of death, I haste
  To the third temple of Diana chaste.
  A sylvan scene with various greens was drawn,
  Shades on the sides, and in the midst a lawn:       
  The silver Cynthia, with her nymphs around,
  Pursued the flying deer, the woods with horns resound:
  Calisto there stood manifest of shame,
  And, turn'd a bear, the northern star became:
  Her son was next, and, by peculiar grace,
  In the cold circle held the second place:
  The stag Acteon in the stream had spied
  The naked huntress, and, for seeing, died:
  His hounds, unknowing of his change pursue
  The chase, and their mistaken master slew.          
  Peneian Daphne too was there to see,
  Apollo's love before, and now his tree:
  The adjoining fane the assembled Greeks express'd,
  And hunting of the Caledonian beast.

RHYME a a *

  Oenides' valour, and his envied prize;
  The fatal power of Atalanta's eyes;
  Diana's vengeance on the victor shown,
  The murderess mother; and consuming son;
  The Volscian queen extended on the plain;
  The treason punish'd, and the traitor slain.        
  The rest were various huntings, well design'd,
  And savage beasts destroy'd, of every kind.

RHYME a a a
 
 The graceful goddess was array'd in green;
  About her feet were little beagles seen,
  That watch'd with upward eyes the motions of their queen.

RHYME a a a

  Her legs were buskin'd, and the left before,
  In act to shoot; a silver bow she bore,
  And at her back a painted quiver wore.

  She trod a waxing moon, that soon would wane,
  And, drinking borrow'd light, be fill'd again:      
  With downcast eyes, as seeming to survey
  The dark dominions, her alternate sway.
  Before her stood a women in her throes,
  And call'd Lucina's aid, her burden to disclose.
  All these the painter drew with such command,
  That Nature snatch'd the pencil from his hand,
  Ashamed and angry that his art could feign
  And mend the tortures of a mother's pain.
  Theseus beheld the fanes of every god,
  And thought his mighty cost was well bestow'd.      
  So princes now their poets should regard;
  But few can write, and fewer can reward.

    The theatre thus raised, the lists enclosed,
  And all with vast magnificence disposed,
  We leave the monarch pleased, and haste to bring
  The knights to combat, and their arms to sing.

TITLE

RHYME a a *

  The day approach'd when Fortune should decide
  The important enterprise, and give the bride;
  For now, the rivals round the world had sought,
  And each his number, well appointed, brought.
  The nations, far and near, contend in choice,
  And send the flower of war by public voice;
  That after, or before, were never known
  Such chiefs, as each an army seem'd alone:
  Beside the champions, all of high degree,
  Who knighthood loved, and deeds of chivalry,              
  Throng'd to the lists, and envied to behold
  The names of others, not their own, enroll'd.

RHYME a a a

  Nor seems it strange; for every noble knight
  Who loves the fair, and is endued with might,
  In such a quarrel would be proud to fight.

RHYME a a *

  There breathes not scarce a man on British ground
  (An isle for love and arms of old renown'd)
  But would have sold his life to purchase fame,
  To Palamon or Arcite sent his name:
  
RHYME a a *

And had the land selected of the best,                    
  Half had come hence, and let the world provide the rest.
  A hundred knights with Palamon there came,
  Approved in fight, and men of mighty name;
  Their arms were several, as their nations were,
  But furnish'd all alike with sword and spear.
  Some wore coat-armour, imitating scale;
  And next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail.
  Some wore a breastplate and a light jupon,
  Their horses clothed with rich caparison:
  Some for defence would leathern bucklers use,             
  Of folded hides; and others shields of pruce.
  One hung a pole-axe at his saddle-bow,
  And one a heavy mace to stun the foe;
  One for his legs and knees provided well,
  With jambeaux arm'd, and double plates of steel:
  This on his helmet wore a lady's glove,
  And that a sleeve embroider'd by his love.

RHYME a a a

    With Palamon above the rest in place,
  Lycurgus came, the surly king of Thrace;
  Black was his beard, and manly was his face;              
  
RHYME a a *

The balls of his broad eyes roll'd in his head,
  And glared betwixt a yellow and a red:
  He look'd a lion with a gloomy stare,
  And o'er his eyebrows hung his matted hair:
  Big-boned, and large of limbs, with sinews strong,
  Broad-shoulder'd, and his arms were round and long.
  Four milk-white bulls (the Thracian use of old)
  Were yoked to draw his car of burnish'd gold.
  Upright he stood, and bore aloft his shield,
  Conspicuous from afar, and overlook'd the field.          
  His surcoat was a bear-skin on his back;
  His hair hung long behind, and glossy raven black.
  His ample forehead bore a coronet,
  With sparkling diamonds and with rubies set:

RHYME a a a

  Ten brace, and more, of greyhounds, snowy fair,
  And tall as stags, ran loose, and coursed around his chair,
  A match for pards in flight, in grappling for the bear:

RHYME a a *

  With golden muzzles all their mouths were bound,
  And collars of the same their necks surround.
  Thus through the fields Lycurgus took his way;            
  His hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array.

RHYME a a *

    To match this monarch, with strong Arcite came
  Emetrius, king of Ind, a mighty name;
  On a bay courser, goodly to behold,
  The trappings of his horse adorn'd with barbarous gold.
  Not Mars bestrod a steed with greater grace;
  His surcoat o'er his arms was cloth of Thrace,
  Adorn'd with pearls, all orient, round, and great;
  His saddle was of gold, with emeralds set,
  His shoulders large a mantle did attire,                  
  With rubies thick, and sparkling as the fire:
  His amber-colour'd locks in ringlets run,
  With graceful negligence, and shone against the sun.
  His nose was aquiline, his eyes were blue;
  Ruddy his lips, and fresh and fair his hue:
  Some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen,
  Whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skill:
  His awful presence did the crowd surprise,
  Nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes;
  Eyes that confess'd him born for kingly sway,             
  So fierce, they flash'd intolerable day.
  His age in nature's youthful prime appear'd,
  And just began to bloom his yellow beard.
  Whene'er he spoke, his voice was heard around,
  Loud as a trumpet, with a silver sound;
  A laurel wreathed his temples, fresh and green;
  And myrtle sprigs, the marks of love, were mix'd between.
  Upon his fist he bore, for his delight,
  An eagle well reclaim'd, and lily white.

RHYME a a *

    His hundred knights attend him to the war,              
  All arm'd for battle; save their heads were bare.
  Words and devices blazed on every shield,
  And pleasing was the terror of the field.

RHYME a a a

  For kings, and dukes, and barons, you might see,
  Like sparkling stars, though different in degree,
  All for the increase of arms, and love of chivalry.

RHYME a a *

  Before the king tame leopards led the way,
  And troops of lions innocently play.
  So Bacchus through the conquer'd Indies rode,
  And beasts in gambols frisk'd before their honest god.  

RHYME a a *

    In this array, the war of either side
  Through Athens pass'd with military pride.
  At prime, they enter'd on the Sunday morn;
  Rich tapestry spread the streets, and flowers the posts adorn.
  The town was all a jubilee of feasts;
  So Theseus will'd, in honour of his guests;
  Himself with open arms the kings embraced,
  Then all the rest in their degrees were graced.
  No harbinger was needful for the night,
  For every house was proud to lodge a knight.        

RHYME a a *

    I pass the royal treat, nor must relate
  The gifts bestow'd, nor how the champions sate:
  Who first, who last, or how the knights address'd
  Their vows, or who was fairest at the feast;
  Whose voice, whose graceful dance did most surprise;
  Soft amorous sighs, and silent love of eyes.
  The rivals call my Muse another way,
  To sing their vigils for the ensuing day.

RHYME a a *

    'Twas ebbing darkness, past the noon of night:
  And Phosphor, on the confines of the light,         

RHYME a a a

  Promised the sun; ere day began to spring,
  The tuneful lark already stretch'd her wing,
  And flickering on her nest, made short essays to sing.

RHYME a a a

  When wakeful Palamon, preventing day,
  Took to the royal lists his early way,
  To Venus at her fane, in her own house, to pray.

RHYME a a *

  There, falling on his knees before her shrine,
  He thus implored with prayers her power divine:

RHYME a a *

    Creator Venus, genial power of love,
  The bliss of men below, and gods above!             
  Beneath the sliding sun thou runn'st thy race,
  Dost fairest shine, and best become thy place.
  For thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear,
  Thy month reveals the spring, and opens all the year.

RHYME a a a
  
Thee, goddess! thee the storms of winter fly,
  Earth smiles with flowers renewing, laughs the sky,
  And birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply.

RHYME a a *

  For thee the lion loathes the taste of blood,
  And, roaring, hunts his female through the wood:
  For thee the bulls rebellow through the groves,     
  And tempt the stream, and snuff their absent loves.

RHYME a a a

  'Tis thine, whate'er is pleasant, good, or fair:
  All nature is thy province, life thy care:
  Thou madest the world, and dost the world repair.

RHYME a a *

  Thou gladder of the mount of Cytheron,
  Increase of Jove, companion of the sun!
  If e'er Adonis touch'd thy tender heart,
  Have pity, goddess, for thou know'st the smart!
  Alas! I have not words to tell my grief;
  To vent my sorrow would be some relief;             
  Light sufferings give us leisure to complain;
  We groan, but cannot speak, in greater pain.
  O goddess! tell thyself what I would say,
  Thou know'st it, and I feel too much to pray.
  So grant my suit, as I enforce my might,
  In love to be thy champion, and thy knight;
  A servant to thy sex, a slave to thee,
  A foe profess'd to barren chastity.
  Nor ask I fame or honour of the field,
  Nor choose I more to vanquish than to yield:        
  In my divine Emilia make me blest;
  Let Fate, or partial Chance, dispose the rest:

RHYME a a *

  Find thou the manner, and the means prepare;
  Possession, more than conquest, is my care.
  Mars is the warrior's god; in him it lies,
  On whom he favours to confer the prize;
  With smiling aspect you serenely move
  In your fifth orb, and rule the realm of love.
  The Fates but only spin the coarser clue,
  The finest of the wool is left for you;             
  Spare me but one small portion of the twine,
  And let the sisters cut below your line:
  The rest among the rubbish may they sweep,
  Or add it to the yarn of some old miser's heap.
  But, if you this ambitious prayer deny,
  (A wish, I grant, beyond mortality,)
  Then let me sink beneath proud Arcite's arms,
  And I once dead, let him possess her charms.

RHYME a a *

    Thus ended he; then with observance due
  The sacred incense on her altar threw:              
  The curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires;
  At length it catches flame, and in a blaze expires;
  At once the gracious goddess gave the sign,
  Her statue shook, and trembled all the shrine:
  Pleased Palamon the tardy omen took:
  For, since the flames pursued the trailing smoke,
  He knew his boon was granted; but the day
  To distance driven, and joy adjourn'd with long delay.

RHYME a a *

    Now morn with rosy light had streak'd the sky,
  Up rose the sun, and up rose Emily;                 
  Address'd her early steps to Cynthia's fane,
  In state attended by her maiden train,
  Who bore the vests that holy rites require,
  Incense, and odorous gums, and cover'd fire.
  The plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown,
  Nor wanted aught besides in honour of the Moon.
  Now while the temple smoked with hallow'd steam,
  They wash the virgin in a living stream;
  The secret ceremonies I conceal,
  Uncouth, perhaps unlawful, to reveal:               
  But such they were as Pagan use required,
  Perform'd by women when the men retired,
  Whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites
  Might turn to scandal, or obscene delights.
  Well-meaners think no harm; but for the rest,
  Things sacred they pervert, and silence is the best.
  Her shining hair, uncomb'd, was loosely spread,
  A crown of mastless oak adorn'd her head:
  When to the shrine approach'd, the spotless maid
  Had kindling fires on either altar laid:            

RHYME a a *

  (The rites were such as were observed of old,
  By Statius in his Theban story told.)
  Then kneeling with her hands across her breast,
  Thus lowly she preferr'd her chaste request:
  Oh, goddess, haunter of the woodland green,
  To whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen;
  Queen of the nether skies, where half the year
  Thy silver beams descend, and light the gloomy sphere!
  Goddess of maids, and conscious of our hearts,
  So keep me from the vengeance of thy darts,         
  Which Niobe's devoted issue felt,
  When hissing through the skies the feather'd deaths were dealt;
  As I desire to live a virgin life,
  Nor know the name of mother or of wife.
  Thy votress from my tender years I am,
  And love, like thee, the woods and sylvan game.

RHYME a a a

  Like death, thou know'st, I loathe the nuptial state,
  And man, the tyrant of our sex, I hate,
  A lowly servant, but a lofty mate:

RHYME a a *

  Where love is duty on the female side;              
  On theirs, mere sensual gust, and sought with surly pride.
  Now by thy triple shape, as thou art seen
  In heaven, earth, hell, and everywhere a queen,
  Grant this my first desire; let discord cease,
  And make betwixt the rivals lasting peace:
  Quench their hot fire, or far from me remove
  The flame, and turn it on some other love;
  Or, if my frowning stars have so decreed,
  That one must be rejected, one succeed,
  Make him my lord, within whose faithful breast      
  Is fix'd my image, and who loves me best.
  But, oh! even that avert! I choose it not,
  But take it as the least unhappy lot.
  A maid I am, and of thy virgin train;
  Oh, let me still that spotless name retain!
  Frequent the forests, thy chaste will obey,
  And only make the beasts of chase my prey!

RHYME a a *

    The flames ascend on either altar clear,
  While thus the blameless maid address'd her prayer.
  When, lo! the burning fire that shone so bright,    
  Flew off all sudden, with extinguish'd light,
  And left one altar dark, a little space;
  Which turn'd self-kindled, and renew'd the blaze:
  The other victor-flame a moment stood,
  Then fell, and lifeless left the extinguish'd wood;
  For ever lost, the irrevocable light
  Forsook the blackening coals, and sunk to night:

RHYME a a a

  At either end it whistled as it flew,
  And as the brands were green, so dropp'd the dew;
  Infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue.     

RHYME a a *

    The maid from that ill omen turn'd her eyes,
  And with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies,
  Nor knew what signified the boding sign,
  But found the Powers displeased, and fear'd the wrath divine.

RHYME a a *

    Then shook the sacred shrine, and sudden light
  Sprung through the vaulted roof, and made the temple bright.

RHYME a a *

    The Power, behold! the Power in glory shone,
  By her bent bow, and her keen arrows known;
  The rest, a huntress issuing from the wood,
  Reclining on her cornel spear she stood.            
  Then gracious thus began: Dismiss thy fear,
  And Heaven's unchanged decrees attentive hear:
  More powerful gods have torn thee from my side,
  Unwilling to resign, and doom'd a bride:
  The two contending knights are weigh'd above;
  One Mars protects, and one the Queen of Love:
  But which the man, is in the Thunderer's breast;
  This he pronounced, 'Tis he who loves thee best.
  The fire that, once extinct, revived again,
  Foreshows the love allotted to remain:              
  Farewell! she said, and vanish'd from the place;
  The sheaf of arrows shook, and rattled in the case.
  Aghast at this, the royal virgin stood,
  Disclaim'd, and now no more a sister of the wood:

RHYME a a a

  But to the parting goddess thus she pray'd:
  Propitious still be present to my aid,
  Nor quite abandon your once favour'd maid.

RHYME a a *

  Then sighing she return'd; but smiled betwixt,
  With hopes and fears, and joys with sorrows mix'd.

RHYME a a *

    The next returning planetary hour                 
  Of Mars, who shared the heptarchy of power,
  His steps bold Arcite to the temple bent,
  To adore with Pagan rites the power armipotent:
  Then prostrate, low before his altar lay,
  And raised his manly voice, and thus began to pray:

RHYME a a *

    Strong God of arms, whose iron sceptre sways
  The freezing North, and Hyperborean seas,
  And Scythian colds, and Thracia's wintry coast,
  Where stand thy steeds, and thou art honour'd most!
  There most; but everywhere thy power is known,      
  The fortune of the fight is all thy own:
  Terror is thine, and wild amazement, flung
  From out thy chariot, withers even the strong:
  And disarray and shameful rout ensue,
  And force is added to the fainting crew.
  Acknowledged as thou art, accept my prayer,
  If aught I have achieved deserve thy care:

RHYME a a a

  If to my utmost power, with sword and shield,
  I dared the death, unknowing how to yield,
  And falling in my rank, still kept the field:       
 
RHYME a a *

 Then let my arms prevail, by thee sustain'd,
  That Emily by conquest may be gain'd.
  Have pity on my pains; nor those unknown
  To Mars, which, when a lover, were his own.
  Venus, the public care of all above,
  Thy stubborn heart has soften'd into love:
  Now, by her blandishments and powerful charms,
  When yielded she lay curling in thy arms,
  Even by thy shame, if shame it may be call'd,
  When Vulcan had thee in his net enthrall'd;         
  (Oh, envied ignominy, sweet disgrace,
  When every god that saw thee wish'd thy place!)
  By those dear pleasures, aid my arms in fight,
  And make me conquer in my patron's right:
  For I am young, a novice in the trade,
  The fool of love, unpractised to persuade:
  And want the soothing arts that catch the fair,
  But, caught myself, lie struggling in the snare:
  And she I love, or laughs at all my pain,
  Or knows her worth too well; and pays me with disdain.  
  For sure I am, unless I win in arms,
  To stand excluded from Emilia's charms:
  Nor can my strength avail, unless by thee
  Endued with force, I gain the victory!

RHYME a a *

  Then for the fire which warm'd thy generous heart,
  Pity thy subject's pains, and equal smart.
  So be the morrow's sweat and labour mine,
  The palm and honour of the conquest thine:
  Then shall the war, and stern debate, and strife
  Immortal, be the business of my life;               
  And in thy fane, the dusty spoils among,
  High on the burnish'd roof, my banner shall be hung:
  Rank'd with my champions' bucklers, and below,
  With arms reversed, the achievements of my foe:
  And while these limbs the vital spirit feeds,
  While day to night, and night to day succeeds,
  Thy smoking altar shall be fat with food
  Of incense, and the grateful steam of blood;
  Burnt-offerings morn and evening shall be thine;
  And fires eternal in thy temple shine.              
  The bush of yellow beard, this length of hair,
  Which from my birth inviolate I bear,
  Guiltless of steel, and from the razor free,
  Shall fall a plenteous crop, reserved for thee.
  So may my arms with victory be blest,
  I ask no more; let Fate dispose the rest.

RHYME a a *

    The champion ceased; there follow'd in the close
  A hollow groan: a murmuring wind arose;
  The rings of iron, that on the doors were hung,
  Sent out a jarring sound, and harshly rung:         
  The bolted gates flew open at the blast,
  The storm rush'd in, and Arcite stood aghast:
  The flames were blown aside, yet shone they bright,
  Fann'd by the wind, and gave a ruffled light.
  Then from the ground a scent began to rise,
  Sweet smelling, as accepted sacrifice:
  This omen pleased, and as the flames aspire
  With odorous incense Arcite heaps the fire:
  Nor wanted hymns to Mars, or heathen charms:
  At length the nodding statue clash'd his arms,      
  And with a sullen sound and feeble cry,
  Half sunk, and half pronounced the word of victory.
  For this, with soul devout, he thank'd the god,
  And, of success secure, return'd to his abode.

RHYME a a *

    These vows thus granted, raised a strife above,
  Betwixt the God of War and Queen of Love.
  She, granting first, had right of time to plead;
  But he had granted too, nor would recede.
  Jove was for Venus; but he fear'd his wife,
  And seem'd unwilling to decide the strife;          
  Till Saturn from his leaden throne arose,
  And found a way the difference to compose:
  Though sparing of his grace, to mischief bent,
  He seldom does a good with good intent.
  Wayward, but wise; by long experience taught,
  To please both parties, for ill ends, he sought:
  For this advantage age from youth has won,
  As not to be outridden, though outrun.
  By fortune he was now to Venus trined,
  And with stern Mars in Capricorn was join'd:        

RHYME a a *

  Of him disposing in his own abode,
  He soothed the goddess, while he gull'd the god:
  Cease, daughter, to complain, and stint the strife;
  Thy Palamon shall have his promised wife:
  And Mars, the lord of conquest, in the fight
  With palm and laurel shall adorn his knight.
  Wide is my course, nor turn I to my place,
  Till length of time, and move with tardy pace.
  Man feels me, when I press the ethereal plains,
  My hand is heavy, and the wound remains.            
  Mine is the shipwreck, in a watery sign;
  And in an earthy, the dark dungeon mine.

RHYME a a a
  
Cold shivering agues, melancholy care,
  And bitter blasting winds, and poison'd air,
  Are mine, and wilful death, resulting from despair.

RHYME a a *

  The throttling quinsey 'tis my star appoints,
  And rheumatisms ascend to rack the joints:
  When churls rebel against their native prince,
  I arm their hands, and furnish the pretence;

RHYME a a *

  And housing in the lion's hateful sign,             
  Bought senates, and deserting troops are mine.
  Mine is the privy poisoning; I command
  Unkindly seasons, and ungrateful land.
  By me kings' palaces are push'd to ground.
  And miners crush'd beneath their mines are found.
  'Twas I slew Samson, when the pillar'd hall
  Fell down, and crush'd the many with the fall.
  My looking is the sire of pestilence,
  That sweeps at once the people and the prince.
  Now weep no more, but trust thy grandsire's art,    
  Mars shall be pleased, and thou perform thy part.
  'Tis ill, though different your complexions are,
  The family of heaven for men should war.
  The expedient pleased, where neither lost his right;
  Mars had the day, and Venus had the night.
  The management they left to Chronos' care;
  Now turn we to the effect, and sing the war.

RHYME a a *

    In Athens all was pleasure, mirth, and play,
  All proper to the spring, and spritely May:
  Which every soul inspired with such delight,        
  'Twas jesting all the day, and love at night.
  Heaven smiled, and gladded was the heart of man;
  And Venus had the world as when it first began.
  At length in sleep their bodies they compose,
  And dreamt the future fight, and early rose.

RHYME a a *

    Now scarce the dawning day began to spring,
  As at a signal given, the streets with clamours ring:

RHYME a a a
  
At once the crowd arose; confused and high,
  Even from the heaven, was heard a shouting cry;
  For Mars was early up, and roused the sky.          

RHYME a a *

  The gods came downward to behold the wars,
  Sharpening their sights, and leaning from their stars.
  The neighing of the generous horse was heard,
  For battle by the busy groom prepared:
  Rustling of harness, rattling of the shield,
  Clattering of armour, furbish'd for the field.
  Crowds to the castle mounted up the street,
  Battering the pavement with their coursers' feet:

RHYME a a *

  The greedy sight might there devour the gold
  Of glittering arms, too dazzling to behold:         
  And polish'd steel, that cast the view aside,
  And crested morions, with their plumy pride.
  Knights, with a long retinue of their squires,
  In gaudy liveries march, and quaint attires.
  One laced the helm, another held the lance:
  A third the shining buckler did advance.
  The courser paw'd the ground with restless feet,
  And snorting foam'd, and champ'd the golden bit.

RHYME a a a  

The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride,
  Files in their hands, and hammers at their side,    
  And nails for loosen'd spears, and thongs for shields provide.

RHYME a a *  

The yeomen guard the streets, in seemly bands;
  And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.

RHYME a a *

    The trumpets, next the gate, in order placed,
  Attend the sign to sound the martial blast;
  The palace-yard is fill'd with floating tides,
  And the last comers bear the former to the sides.
  The throng is in the midst: the common crew
  Shut out, the hall admits the better few;
  In knots they stand, or in a rank they walk,        
  Serious in aspect, earnest in their talk;
  Factious, and favouring this or the other side,
  As their strong fancy or weak reason guide:
  Their wagers back their wishes; numbers hold
  With the fair freckled king, and beard of gold:
  So vigorous are his eyes, such rays they cast,
  So prominent his eagle's beak is placed.
  But most their looks on the black monarch bend,
  His rising muscles, and his brawn commend;
  His double-biting axe, and beamy spear,             
  Each asking a gigantic force to rear.
  All spoke as partial favour moved the mind;
  And, safe themselves, at others' cost divined.

    Waked by the cries, the Athenian chief arose,
  The knightly forms of combat to dispose;
  And passing through the obsequious guards, he sate
  Conspicuous on a throne, sublime in state;
  There, for the two contending knights he sent;
  Arm'd cap-a-pie, with reverence low they bent;
  He smiled on both, and with superior look           
  Alike their offer'd adoration took.
  The people press on every side to see
  Their awful prince, and hear his high decree.
  Then signing to their heralds with his hand,
  They gave his orders from their lofty stand.
  Silence is thrice enjoin'd; then thus aloud
  The king-at-arms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd:

RHYME a a *

    Our sovereign lord has ponder'd in his mind
  The means to spare the blood of gentle kind;
  And of his grace, and inborn clemency,              
  He modifies his first severe decree!
  The keener edge of battle to rebate,
  The troops for honour fighting, not for hate:
  He wills, not death should terminate their strife,
  And wounds, if wounds ensue, be short of life:
  But issues, ere the fight, his dread command,
  That slings afar, and poniards hand to hand,
  Be banish'd from the field; that none shall dare
  With shorten'd sword to stab in closer war;
  But in fair combat fight with manly strength,       
  Nor push with biting point, but strike at length;

RHYME a a *

  The tourney is allow'd but one career,
  Of the tough ash, with the sharp-grinded spear;
  But knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain,
  And fight on foot their honour to regain;
  Nor, if at mischief taken, on the ground
  Be slain, but prisoners to the pillar bound,
  At either barrier placed; nor (captives made),
  Be freed, or arm'd anew the fight invade.
  The chief of either side, bereft of life,           
  Or yielded to his foe, concludes the strife.
  Thus dooms the lord: now, valiant knights and young,
  Fight each his fill with swords and maces long.

RHYME a a *

    The herald ends: the vaulted firmament
  With loud acclaims and vast applause is rent:
  Heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good,
  So just, and yet so provident of blood!
  This was the general cry. The trumpets sound,
  And warlike symphony is heard around.
  The marching troops through Athens take their way,  
  The great earl-marshal orders their array.
  The fair from high the passing pomp behold;
  A rain of flowers is from the windows roll'd.
  The casements are with golden tissue spread,
  And horses' hoofs, for earth, on silken tapestry tread.
  The king goes midmost, and the rivals ride
  In equal rank, and close his either side.

RHYME a a *

  Next after these, there rode the royal wife,
  With Emily, the cause, and the reward of strife.
  The following cavalcade, by three and three,        
  Proceed by titles marshall'd in degree.
  Thus through the southern gate they take their way,
  And at the list arrived ere prime of day.
  There, parting from the king, the chiefs divide,
  And wheeling east and west, before their many ride.
  The Athenian monarch mounts his throne on high,
  And after him the queen and Emily:
  Next these, the kindred of the crown are graced
  With nearer seats, and lords by ladies placed.
  Scarce were they seated, when with clamours loud    
  In rush'd at once a rude promiscuous crowd;
  The guards, and then each other overbear,
  And in a moment throng the spacious theatre.
  Now changed the jarring noise to whispers low,
  As winds forsaking seas more softly blow;
  When at the western gate, on which the car
  Is placed aloft, that bears the god of war,
  Proud Arcite entering arm'd before his train,
  Stops at the barrier, and divides the plain.
  Red was his banner, and display'd abroad            
  The bloody colours of his patron god.

RHYME a a *

    At that self moment enters Palamon
  The gate of Venus, and the rising Sun;
  Waved by the wanton winds, his banner flies,
  All maiden white, and shares the people's eyes.
  From east to west, look all the world around,
  Two troops so match'd were never to be found;
  Such bodies built for strength, of equal age,
  In stature sized; so proud in equipage:
  The nicest eye could no distinction make,           
  Where lay the advantage, or what side to take.

RHYME a a *

    Thus ranged, the herald for the last proclaims
  A silence, while they answer'd to their names:
  For so the king decreed, to shun the care,
  The fraud of musters false, the common bane of war.
  The tale was just, and then the gates were closed;
  And chief to chief, and troop to troop opposed.
  The heralds last retired, and loudly cried--
  The fortune of the field be fairly tried!

RHYME a a a

    At this, the challenger with fierce defy          
  His trumpet sounds; the challenged makes reply;
  With clangour rings the field, resounds the vaulted sky.

RHYME a a *

  Their vizors closed, their lances in the rest,
  Or at the helmet pointed, or the crest,
  They vanish from the barrier, speed the race,
  And spurring see decrease the middle space.
  A cloud of smoke envelops either host,
  And all at once the combatants are lost:
  Darkling they join adverse, and shock unseen,
  Coursers with coursers jostling, men with men:      
  As labouring in eclipse, a while they stay,
  Till the next blast of wind restores the day.
  They look anew: the beauteous form of fight
  Is changed, and war appears a grisly sight.
  Two troops in fair array one moment show'd,
  The next, a field with fallen bodies strow'd:
  Not half the number in their seats are found;
  But men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground.
  The points of spears are stuck within the shield,
  The steeds without their riders scour the field.    
  The knights, unhorsed, on foot renew the fight;
  The glittering falchions cast a gleaming light:
  Hauberks and helms are hew'd with many a wound,
  Out spins the streaming blood and dyes the ground.

RHYME a a *

  The mighty maces with such haste descend,
  They break the bones, and make the solid armour bend.
  This thrusts amid the throng with furious force;
  Down goes, at once, the horseman and the horse:
  That courser stumbles on the fallen steed,
  And floundering throws the rider o'er his head.     
  One rolls along, a foot-ball to his foes;
  One with a broken truncheon deals his blows.
  This halting, this disabled with his wound,
  In triumph led, is to the pillar bound,
  Where by the king's award he must abide:
  There goes a captive led on the other side.
  By fits they cease; and leaning on the lance,
  Take breath a while, and to new fight advance.

RHYME a a *

    Full oft the rivals met, and neither spared
  His utmost force, and each forgot to ward.          
  The head of this was to the saddle bent,
  The other backward to the crupper sent:
  Both were by turns unhorsed; the jealous blows
  Fall thick and heavy, when on foot they close.
  So deep their falchions bite, that every stroke
  Pierced to the quick; and equal wounds they gave and took.
  Borne far asunder by the tides of men,
  Like adamant and steel they meet again.

RHYME a a a

    So when a tiger sucks the bullock's blood,
  A famish'd lion issuing from the wood               
  Roars lordly fierce, and challenges the food:

RHYME a a *

  Each claims possession, neither will obey,
  But both their paws are fasten'd on the prey;
  They bite, they tear; and while in vain they strive,
  The swains come arm'd between, and both to distance drive.

RHYME a a *

    At length, as Fate foredoom'd, and all things tend
  By course of time to their appointed end;
  So when the sun to west was far declined,
  And both afresh in mortal battle join'd,
  The strong Emetrius came in Arcite's aid,           
  And Palamon with odds was overlaid:
  For turning short, he struck with all his might
  Full on the helmet of the unwary knight.
  Deep was the wound; he stagger'd with the blow,
  And turn'd him to his unexpected foe;
  Whom with such force he struck, he fell'd him down,
  And cleft the circle of his golden crown.
  But Arcite's men, who now prevail'd in fight,
  Twice ten at once surround the single knight:
  O'erpower'd, at length, they force him to the ground,   
  Unyielded as he was, and to the pillar bound;
  And King Lycurgus, while he fought in vain
  His friend to free, was tumbled on the plain.

RHYME a a *

    Who now laments but Palamon, compell'd
  No more to try the fortune of the field!
  And, worse than death, to view with hateful eyes
  His rival's conquest, and renounce the prize!

RHYME a a *

    The royal judge, on his tribunal placed,
  Who had beheld the fight from first to last,
  Bade cease the war; pronouncing from on high,       
  Arcite of Thebes had won the beauteous Emily.

RHYME a a a 

 The sound of trumpets to the voice replied,
  And round the royal lists the heralds cried,
  Arcite of Thebes has won the beauteous bride!

RHYME a a *

    The people rend the skies with vast applause;
  All own the chief, when Fortune owns the cause.
  Arcite is own'd even by the gods above,
  And conquering Mars insults the Queen of Love.
  So laugh'd he, when the rightful Titan fail'd,
  And Jove's usurping arms in heaven prevail'd.       
  Laugh'd all the powers who favour tyranny;
  And all the standing army of the sky.
  But Venus with dejected eyes appears,
  And, weeping on the lists, distill'd her tears;
  Her will refused, which grieves a woman most,
  And, in her champion foil'd, the cause of Love is lost.
  Till Saturn said, Fair daughter, now be still,
  The blustering fool has satisfied his will;
  His boon is given; his knight has gain'd the day,
  But lost the prize; the arrears are yet to pay;     
  Thy hour is come, and mine the care shall be
  To please thy knight, and set thy promise free.

RHYME a a *

    Now while the heralds run the lists around,
  And Arcite! Arcite! heaven and earth resound;
  A miracle (nor less it could be call'd)
  Their joy with unexpected sorrow pall'd.
  The victor knight had laid his helm aside,
  Part for his ease, the greater part for pride;
  Bare-headed, popularly low he bow'd,
  And paid the salutations of the crowd.              
  Then spurring at full speed, ran endlong on
  Where Theseus sate on his imperial throne;
  Furious he drove, and upward cast his eye,
  Where, next the queen, was placed his Emily;
  Then passing, to the saddle-bow he bent:
  A sweet regard the gracious virgin lent;
  (For women, to the brave an easy prey,
  Still follow Fortune where she leads the way):
 
RHYME a a *

 Just then, from earth sprung out a flashing fire,
  By Pluto sent, at Saturn's bad desire:              
  The startling steed was seized with sudden fright,
  And, bounding, o'er the pommel cast the knight:
  Forward he flew, and pitching on his head,
  He quiver'd with his feet, and lay for dead.
  Black was his countenance in a little space,
  For all the blood was gather'd in his face.
  Help was at hand: they rear'd him from the ground,
  And from his cumbrous arms his limbs unbound;
  Then lanced a vein, and watch'd returning breath;
  It came, but clogg'd with symptoms of his death.    
  The saddle-bow the noble parts had press'd,
  All bruised and mortified his manly breast.
  Him still entranced, and in a litter laid,
  They bore from field, and to his bed convey'd.
  At length he waked, and with a feeble cry,
  The word he first pronounced was "Emily."

RHYME a a *

    Mean time the king, though inwardly he mourn'd,
  In pomp triumphant to the town return'd,
  Attended by the chiefs, who fought the field;
  (Now friendly mix'd, and in one troop compell'd.)   
  Composed his looks to counterfeited cheer,
  And bade them not for Arcite's life to fear.
  But that which gladded all the warrior train,
  Though most were sorely wounded, none were slain.
  The surgeons soon despoil'd them of their arms,
  And some with salves they cure, and some with charms;
  Foment the bruises, and the pains assuage,
  And heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage.
  The king in person visits all around,
  Comforts the sick, congratulates the sound;         
  Honours the princely chiefs, rewards the rest,
  And holds for thrice three days a royal feast.
  None was disgraced; for falling is no shame;
  And cowardice alone is loss of fame.
  The venturous knight is from the saddle thrown;
  But 'tis the fault of Fortune, not his own,
  If crowds and palms the conquering side adorn,
  The victor under better stars was born:
  The brave man seeks not popular applause,
  Nor, overpower'd with arms, deserts his cause;      
  Unshamed, though foil'd, he does the best he can;
  Force is of brutes, but honour is of man.

RHYME a a *

    Thus Theseus smiled on all with equal grace,
  And each was set according to his place;
  With ease were reconciled the differing parts,
  For envy never dwells in noble hearts.
  At length they took their leave, the time expired,
  Well pleased, and to their several homes retired.

RHYME a a *

    Mean while the health of Arcite still impairs;
  From bad proceeds to worse, and mocks the leech's cares 
  Swoln is his breast; his inward pains increase,
  All means are used, and all without success.
  The clotted blood lies heavy on his heart,
  Corrupts, and there remains, in spite of art:
  Nor breathing veins, nor cupping will prevail;
  All outward remedies and inward fail:
  The mould of nature's fabric is destroy'd,
  Her vessels discomposed, her virtue void;

RHYME a a a

  The bellows of his lungs begin to swell:
  All out of frame is every secret cell,              
  Nor can the good receive, nor bad expel.

RHYME a a *

  Those breathing organs thus within oppress'd,
  With venom soon distend the sinews of his breast.
  Nought profits him to save abandon'd life,
  Nor vomit's upward aid, nor downward laxative.
  The midmost region batter'd and destroy'd,
  When nature cannot work, the effect of art is void.
  For physic can but mend our crazy state,
  Patch an old building, not a new create.
  Arcite is doom'd to die in all his pride,           
  Must leave his youth, and yield his beauteous bride,
  Gain'd hardly, against right, and unenjoy'd.
  When 'twas declared all hope of life was past,
  Conscience (that of all physic works the last)
  Caused him to send for Emily in haste.
  With her, at his desire, came Palamon;
  Then on his pillow raised, he thus begun:

RHYME a a *

    No language can express the smallest part
  Of what I feel, and suffer in my heart
  For you, whom best I love and value most;           
  But to your service I bequeath my ghost;
  Which from this mortal body when untied,
  Unseen, unheard, shall hover at your side;
  Nor fright you waking, nor your sleep offend,
  But wait officious, and your steps attend:
  How I have loved, excuse my faltering tongue,
  My spirit's feeble, and my pains are strong:
  This I may say, I only grieve to die,
  Because I lose my charming Emily:
  To die, when Heaven had put you in my power,        
  Fate could not choose a more malicious hour!
  What greater curse could envious Fortune give,
  Than just to die, when I began to live?

RHYME a a *

  Vain men! how vanishing a bliss we crave,
  Now warm in love, now withering in the grave!
  Never, oh never more to see the sun!
  Still dark, in a damp vault, and still alone!
  This fate is common; but I lose my breath;
  Near bliss, and yet not bless'd before my death.
  Farewell; but take me dying in your arms,           
  'Tis all I can enjoy of all your charms:
  This hand I cannot but in death resign;
  Ah! could I live! but while I live 'tis mine.
  I feel my end approach, and thus embraced,
  Am pleased to die; but hear me speak my last:
  Ah! my sweet foe, for you, and you alone,
  I broke my faith with injured Palamon.
  But love the sense of right and wrong confounds,
  Strong love and proud ambition have no bounds.
  And much I doubt, should Heaven my life prolong,    
  I should return to justify my wrong:

RHYME a a *

  For while my former flames remain within,
  Repentance is but want of power to sin.
  With mortal hatred I pursued his life,
  Nor he, nor you, were guilty of the strife;
  Nor I, but as I loved; yet all combined,
  Your beauty, and my impotence of mind;
  And his concurrent flame that blew my fire;
  For still our kindred souls had one desire.
  He had a moment's right in point of time;           
  Had I seen first, then his had been the crime.
  Fate made it mine, and justified his right;
  Nor holds this earth a more deserving knight,
  For virtue, valour, and for noble blood,
  Truth, honour, all that is comprised in good;
  So help me Heaven, in all the world is none
  So worthy to be loved as Palamon.
  He loves you too, with such an holy fire,
  As will not, cannot, but with life expire:
  Our vow'd affections both have often tried,         
  Nor any love but yours could ours divide.
  Then, by my love's inviolable band,
  By my long suffering, and my short command,
  If e'er you plight your vows when I am gone,
  Have pity on the faithful Palamon.

RHYME a a *

    This was his last; for Death came on amain,
  And exercised below his iron reign;
  Then upward to the seat of life he goes:
  Sense fled before him, what he touch'd he froze:
  Yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw,         
  Though less and less of Emily he saw;
  So, speechless, for a little space he lay;
  Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away.

RHYME a a *

    But whither went his soul, let such relate
  Who search the secrets of the future state:
  Divines can say but what themselves believe;
  Strong proofs they have, but not demonstrative:
  For, were all plain, then all sides must agree,
  And faith itself be lost in certainty.
  To live uprightly, then, is sure the best,          
  To save ourselves, and not to damn the rest.
  The soul of Arcite went where heathens go,
  Who better live than we, though less they know.

RHYME a a *

    In Palamon a manly grief appears;
  Silent, he wept, ashamed to show his tears:
  Emilia shriek'd but once, and then, oppress'd
  With sorrow, sunk upon her lover's breast:
  Till Theseus in his arms convey'd with care,
Far from so sad a sight, the swooning fair.

RHYME a a a

  'Twere loss of time her sorrow to relate;           
  Ill bears the sex a youthful lover's fate,
  When just approaching to the nuptial state.

RHYME a a *

  But like a low-hung cloud, it rains so fast,
  That all at once it falls, and cannot last.
  The face of things is changed, and Athens now,
  That laugh'd so late, becomes the scene of woe:
  Matrons and maids, both sexes, every state,
  With tears lament the knight's untimely fate.
  Nor greater grief in falling Troy was seen
  For Hector's death; but Hector was not then,        
  Old men with dust deform'd their hoary hair,
  The women beat their breasts, their cheeks they tear.
  Why wouldst thou go, with one consent they cry,
  When thou hadst gold enough, and Emily?

RHYME a a *

    Theseus himself, who should have cheer'd the grief
  Of others, wanted now the same relief;
  Old Egeus only could revive his son,
  Who various changes of the world had known,
  And strange vicissitudes of human fate,
  Still altering, never in a steady state;            
  Good after ill, and, after pain, delight,
  Alternate like the scenes of day and night:
  Since every man who lives, is born to die,
  And none can boast sincere felicity,
  With equal mind, what happens, let us bear,
  Nor joy, nor grieve too much for things beyond our care.
  Like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend;
  The world's an inn, and death the journey's end.
  Even kings but play; and when their part is done,
  Some other, worse or better, mount the throne.      
  With words like these the crowd was satisfied,
  And so they would have been, had Theseus died.

But he, their king, was labouring in his mind,
  A fitting place for funeral pomps to find,
  Which were in honour of the dead design'd.

RHYME a a *

  And after long debate, at last he found
  (As love itself had mark'd the spot of ground)
  That grove for ever green, that conscious laund,
  Where he with Palamon fought hand to hand:
  That where he fed his amorous desires               
  With soft complaints, and felt his hottest fires;
  There other flames might waste his earthly part,
  And burn his limbs, where love had burn'd his heart.

RHYME a a *

    This once resolved, the peasants were enjoin'd
  Sere-wood, and firs, and dodder'd oaks to find.
  With sounding axes to the grove they go,
  Fell, split, and lay the fuel on a row,
  Vulcanian food: a bier is next prepared,
  On which the lifeless body should be rear'd,
  Cover'd with cloth of gold, on which was laid       
  The corpse of Arcite, in like robes array'd.
  White gloves were on his hands, and on his head
  A wreath of laurel, mix'd with myrtle spread.
  A sword keen-edged within his right he held,
  The warlike emblem of the conquer'd field:
  Bare was his manly visage on the bier:
  Menaced his countenance; even in death severe.
  Then to the palace-hall they bore the knight,
  To lie in solemn state, a public sight.
  Groans, cries, and howlings fill the crowded place, 
  And unaffected sorrow sate on every face.
  
RHYME a a *

Sad Palamon above the rest appears,
  In sable garments, dew'd with gushing tears:
  His auburn locks on either shoulder flow'd,
  Which to the funeral of his friend he vow'd:
  But Emily, as chief, was next his side,
  A virgin-widow, and a mourning bride.
  And that the princely obsequies might be
  Perform'd according to his high degree,
 
RHYME a a a

 The steed, that bore him living to the fight,       
  Was trapp'd with polish'd steel, all shining bright,
  And cover'd with the achievements of the knight.

RHYME a a *

  The riders rode abreast, and one his shield,
  His lance of cornel-wood another held;
  The third his bow, and, glorious to behold,
  The costly quiver, all of burnish'd gold.
  The noblest of the Grecians next appear,
  And, weeping, on their shoulders bore the bier;
  With sober pace they march'd, and often stay'd,
  And through the master-street the corpse convey'd.  
  The houses to their tops with black were spread,
  And even the pavements were with mourning hid.
  The right side of the pall old Egeus kept,
  And on the left the royal Theseus wept;
  Each bore a golden bowl, of work divine,
  With honey fill'd, and milk, and mix'd with ruddy wine.
  Then Palamon, the kinsman of the slain,
  And after him appear'd the illustrious train.
  To grace the pomp, came Emily the bright,
  With cover'd fire, the funeral pile to light.       
  With high devotion was the service made,
  And all the rites of Pagan honour paid:
  So lofty was the pile, a Parthian bow,
  With vigour drawn, must send the shaft below.

RHYME a a *

  The bottom was full twenty fathom broad,
  With crackling straw beneath in due proportion strew'd.
  The fabric seem'd a wood of rising green,
  With sulphur and bitumen cast between,
  To feed the flames: the trees were unctuous fir,
  And mountain-ash, the mother of the spear;          
  The mourner-yew, and builder oak were there;
  The beech, the swimming alder, and the plane,
  Hard box, and linden of a softer grain,
  And laurels, which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain.
  How they were rank'd, shall rest untold by me,
  With nameless Nymphs that lived in every tree;
  Nor how the Dryads, or the woodland train,
  Disherited, ran howling o'er the plain:
  Nor how the birds to foreign seats repair'd,
  Or beasts, that bolted out, and saw the forest bared:   
  Nor how the ground, now clear'd, with ghastly fright
  Beheld the sudden sun, a stranger to the light.

RHYME a a *

    The straw, as first I said, was laid below;
  Of chips and sere-wood was the second row;
  The third of greens, and timber newly fell'd;
  The fourth high stage the fragrant odours held,
  And pearls, and precious stones, and rich array;
  In midst of which, embalm'd, the body lay.
  The service sung, the maid with mourning eyes
  The stubble fired; the smouldering flames arise:    
  This office done, she sunk upon the ground;
  But what she spoke, recover'd from her swound,
  I want the wit in moving words to dress;
  But by themselves the tender sex may guess.
  While the devouring fire was burning fast,
  Rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast;

  And some their shields, and some their lances threw,
  And gave their warrior's ghost a warrior's due.

 Full bowls of wine, of honey, milk, and blood
  Were pour'd upon the pile of burning wood,          
  And hissing flames receive, and hungry lick the food.

  Then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around
  The fire, and Arcite's name they thrice resound:
  Hail, and farewell! they shouted thrice amain,
  Thrice facing to the left, and thrice they turn'd again:
  Still as they turn'd, they beat their clattering shields;
  The women mix their cries; and clamour fills the fields.
  The warlike wakes continued all the night,
  And funeral games were play'd at new returning light;
  Who naked wrestled best, besmear'd with oil,  
  Or who with gauntlets gave or took the foil,
  I will not tell you, nor would you attend;
  But briefly haste to my long story's end.

    I pass the rest; the year was fully mourn'd,
  And Palamon long since to Thebes returned:
  When, by the Grecians' general consent,
  At Athens Theseus held his parliament:
  Among the laws that pass'd, it was decreed,
  That conquer'd Thebes from bondage should be freed;
  Reserving homage to the Athenian throne,      
  To which the sovereign summon'd Palamon.
  Unknowing of the cause, he took his way,
  Mournful in mind, and still in black array.

RHYME a a *

    The monarch mounts the throne, and, placed on high,
  Commands into the court the beauteous Emily:
  So call'd, she came; the senate rose, and paid
  Becoming reverence to the royal maid.
  And first, soft whispers through the assembly went;
  With silent wonder then they watch'd the event:
  All hush'd, the king arose with awful grace,  
  Deep thought was in his breast, and counsel in his face.
  At length he sigh'd; and having first prepared
  The attentive audience, thus his will declared:

RHYME a a *

    The Cause and Spring of motion, from above,
  Hung down on earth the golden chain of Love:
  Great was the effect, and high was his intent,
  When peace among the jarring seeds he sent.
  Fire, flood, and earth, and air by this were bound,
  And Love, the common link, the new creation crown'd.
  The chain still holds; for though the forms decay,
  Eternal matter never wears away:
  The same First Mover certain bounds has placed,
  How long those perishable forms shall last:
  Nor can they last beyond the time assign'd
  By that all-seeing, and all-making mind:
  Shorten their hours they may; for will is free;
  But never pass the appointed destiny.
  So men oppress'd, when weary of their breath,
  Throw off the burden, and suborn their death.
  Then since those forms begin, and have their end, 
  On some unalter'd cause they sure depend:
  Parts of the whole are we; but God the whole;
  Who gives us life, and animating soul.
  For nature cannot from a part derive
  That being, which the whole can only give:
  He perfect, stable; but imperfect we,
  Subject to change, and different in degree;
  Plants, beasts, and man; and as our organs are,
  We more or less of his perfection share.

RHYME a a *

  But by a long descent, the ethereal fire      
  Corrupts; and forms, the mortal part, expire:
  As he withdraws his virtue, so they pass,
  And the same matter makes another mass:
  This law the Omniscient Power was pleased to give,
  That every kind should by succession live:
  That individuals die, His will ordains;
  The propagated species still remains.
  The monarch oak, the patriarch of the trees,
  Shoots rising up, and spreads by slow degrees;
  Three centuries he grows, and three he stays, 
  Supreme in state, and in three more decays:
  So wears the paving pebble in the street,
  And towns and towers their fatal periods meet:
  So rivers, rapid once, now naked lie,
  Forsaken of their springs; and leave their channels dry.
  So man, at first a drop, dilates with heat,
  Then, form'd, the little heart begins to beat;
  Secret he feeds, unknowing in the cell;
  At length, for hatching ripe, he breaks the shell,
  And struggles into breath, and cries for aid; 
  Then, helpless, in his mother's lap is laid:
  He creeps, he walks, and issuing into man,
  Grudges their life, from whence his own began:

RHYME a a *

  Reckless of laws, affects to rule alone,
  Anxious to reign, and restless on the throne:
  First vegetive, then feels, and reasons last;
  Rich of three souls, and lives all three to waste.
  Some thus; but thousands more in flower of age:
  For few arrive to run the latter stage.
  Sunk in the first, in battle some are slain,  
  And others whelm'd beneath the stormy main.
  What makes all this, but Jupiter the king,
  At whose command we perish, and we spring?
  Then 'tis our best, since thus ordain'd to die,
  To make a virtue of necessity.
  Take what he gives, since to rebel is vain;
  The bad grows better, which we well sustain;
  And could we choose the time, and choose aright,
  'Tis best to die, our honour at the height.
  When we have done our ancestors no shame,     
  But served our friends, and well secured our fame;
  Then should we wish our happy life to close,
  And leave no more for fortune to dispose:
  So should we make our death a glad relief
  From future shame, from sickness, and from grief:
  Enjoying while we live the present hour,
  And dying in our excellence and flower.
  Then round our death-bed every friend should run,
  And joyous of our conquest early won:

RHYME a a *

  While the malicious world with envious tears  
  Should grudge our happy end, and wish it theirs.

RHYME a a a
 
 Since then our Arcite is with honour dead,
  Why should we mourn, that he so soon is freed,
  Or call untimely, what the gods decreed?

RHYME a a *

  With grief as just, a friend may be deplored
  From a foul prison to free air restored.
  Ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife,
  Could tears recall him into wretched life?
  Their sorrow hurts themselves; on him is lost;
  And worse than both, offends his happy ghost. 
  What then remains, but, after past annoy,
  To take the good vicissitude of joy?
  To thank the gracious gods for what they give,
  Possess our souls, and while we live, to live?
  Ordain we then two sorrows to combine,
  And in one point the extremes of grief to join;
  That thence resulting joy may be renew'd,
  As jarring notes in harmony conclude.
  Then I propose that Palamon shall be
  In marriage join'd with beauteous Emily;      

RHYME a a *

  For which already I have gain'd the assent
  Of my free people in full parliament.
  Long love to her has borne the faithful knight,
  And well deserved, had fortune done him right:
  'Tis time to mend her fault; since Emily
  By Arcite's death from former vows is free:
  If you, fair sister, ratify the accord,
  And take him for your husband, and your lord,
  'Tis no dishonour to confer your grace
  On one descended from a royal race:           
  And were he less, yet years of service past,
  From grateful souls exact reward at last:
  Pity is Heaven's and yours; nor can she find
  A throne so soft as in a woman's mind.
  He said; she blush'd; and as o'er-awed by might,
  Seem'd to give Theseus what she gave the knight.
  Then turning to the Theban thus he said:
  Small arguments are needful to persuade

RHYME a a *

  Your temper to comply with my command;
  And speaking thus, he gave Emilia's hand.     

RHYME a a a

  Smiled Venus, to behold her own true knight
  Obtain the conquest, though he lost the fight;
  And bless'd with nuptial bliss the sweet laborious night.

RHYME a a *

  Eros, and Anteros, on either side,
  One fired the bridegroom, and one warm'd the bride;
  And long-attending Hymen from above,
  Shower'd on the bed the whole Idalian grove.
  All of a tenor was their after-life,
  No day discolour'd with domestic strife;
  No jealousy, but mutual truth believed,       
  Secure repose, and kindness undeceived.
  Thus Heaven, beyond the compass of his thought,
  Sent him the blessing he so dearly bought.

RHYME a a *

    So may the Queen of Love long duty bless,
  And all true lovers find the same success!

TITLE

RHYME a a *

  There lived, as authors tell, in days of yore,
  A widow somewhat old, and very poor:
  Deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood,
  Well thatch'd, and under covert of a wood.
  This dowager, on whom my tale I found,
  Since last she laid her husband in the ground,
  A simple sober life, in patience, led,
  And had but just enough to buy her bread:
  But huswifing the little Heaven had lent,
  She duly paid a groat for quarter rent;                   
  And pinch'd her belly, with her daughters two,
  To bring the year about with much ado.

RHYME a a *

    The cattle in her homestead were three sows,
  A ewe call'd Mally, and three brinded cows.
  Her parlour-window stuck with herbs around,
  Of savoury smell; and rushes strew'd the ground.
  A mapple-dresser in her hall she had,
  On which full many a slender meal she made;
  For no delicious morsel pass'd her throat;
  According to her cloth she cut her coat:                  
  No poignant sauce she knew, nor costly treat,
  Her hunger gave a relish to her meat:
  A sparing diet did her health assure;
  Or sick, a pepper posset was her cure.
  Before the day was done, her work she sped,
  And never went by candlelight to bed:
  With exercise she sweat ill humours out,
  Her dancing was not hindered by the gout.
  Her poverty was glad; her heart content;
  Nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant.            
  Of wine she never tasted through the year,
  But white and black was all her homely cheer:
  Brown bread, and milk (but first she skimm'd her bowls),
  And rashers of singed bacon on the coals;
  On holy days, an egg or two at most;
  But her ambition never reach'd to roast.

RHYME a a *

    A yard she had with pales enclosed about,
  Some high, some low, and a dry ditch without.
  Within this homestead lived, without a peer
  For crowing loud, the noble Chanticleer;                  
  So hight her cock, whose singing did surpass
  The merry notes of organs at the mass.
  More certain was the crowing of the cock
  To number hours, than is an abbey-clock;
  And sooner than the matin-bell was rung,
  He clapp'd his wings upon his roost, and sung:
  For when degrees fifteen ascended right,
  By sure instinct he knew 'twas one at night.
  High was his comb, and coral-red withal,
  In dents embattled like a castle wall;                    
  His bill was raven-black, and shone like jet;
  Blue were his legs, and orient were his feet;
  White were his nails, like silver to behold,
  His body glittering like the burnish'd gold.
  This gentle cock, for solace of his life,
  Six misses had, besides his lawful wife.
  Scandal that spares no king, though ne'er so good,
  Says, they were all of his own flesh and blood,
  His sisters both by sire and mother's side;
  And sure their likeness show'd them near allied.          
  But make the worst, the monarch did no more,
  Than all the Ptolemys had done before:
  When incest is for interest of a nation,
  'Tis made no sin by holy dispensation.
  Some lines have been maintain'd by this alone,
  Which by their common ugliness are known.

RHYME a a *

    But passing this, as from our tale apart,
  Dame Partlet was the sovereign of his heart:
  Ardent in love, outrageous in his play,
  He feather'd her a hundred times a day:                   
  And she, that was not only passing fair,
  But was with all discreet, and debonair,
  Resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil,
  Though loth; and let him work his wicked will:

RHYME a a a

  At board and bed was affable and kind,
  According as their marriage vow did bind,
  And as the Church's precept had enjoin'd.

RHYME a a a

  Even since she was a se'ennight old, they say,
  Was chaste and humble to her dying day,
  Nor chick nor hen was known to disobey.                   

RHYME a a *

    By this her husband's heart she did obtain;
  What cannot beauty, join'd with virtue, gain!
  She was his only joy, and he her pride,
  She, when he walk'd, went pecking by his side;
  If spurning up the ground, he sprung a corn,
  The tribute in his bill to her was borne.
  But oh! what joy it was to hear him sing
  In summer, when the day began to spring,
  Stretching his neck, and warbling in his throat;
  _Solus cum sola_ then was all his note.                   
  For in the days of yore, the birds of parts
  Were bred to speak, and sing, and learn the liberal arts.

RHYME a a *

    It happ'd that, perching on the parlour-beam
  Amidst his wives, he had a deadly dream,
  Just at the dawn; and sigh'd, and groan'd so fast,
  As every breath he drew would be his last.
  Dame Partlet, ever nearest to his side,
  Heard all his piteous moan, and how he cried
  For help from gods and men: and sore aghast
  She peck'd and pull'd, and waken'd him at last.     
  Dear heart, said she, for love of heaven declare
  Your pain, and make me partner in your care!
  You groan, sir, ever since the morning-light,
  As something had disturb'd your noble sprite.

RHYME a a *

    And, madam, well I might, said Chanticleer;
  Never was shrovetide cock in such a fear.
  Even still I run all over in a sweat,
  My princely senses not recover'd yet.
  For such a dream I had, of dire portent,
  That much I fear my body will be shent:             
  It bodes I shall have wars and woful strife,
  Or in a loathsome dungeon end my life.

RHYME a a a

  Know, dame, I dreamt within my troubled breast,
  That in our yard I saw a murderous beast,
  That on my body would have made arrest.

RHYME a a *

  With waking eyes I ne'er beheld his fellow;
  His colour was betwixt a red and yellow:
  Tipp'd was his tail, and both his pricking ears
  Were black; and much unlike his other hairs:
  The rest, in shape a beagle's whelp throughout,     
  With broader forehead, and a sharper snout:
  Deep in his front were sunk his glowing eyes,
  That yet, methinks, I see him with surprise.
  Reach out your hand, I drop with clammy sweat,
  And lay it to my heart, and feel it beat.
  Now fie, for shame, quoth she; by Heaven above,
  Thou hast for ever lost thy lady's love!
  No woman can endure a recreant knight,
  He must be bold by day, and free by night:
  Our sex desires a husband or a friend,              
  Who can our honour and his own defend.
  Wise, hardy, secret, liberal of his purse:
  A fool is nauseous, but a coward worse:
  No bragging coxcomb, yet no baffled knight.
  How darest thou talk of love, and darest not fight?
  How darest thou tell thy dame thou art affear'd?
  Hast thou no manly heart, and hast a beard?

RHYME a a *

    If aught from fearful dreams may be divined,
  They signify a cock of dunghill kind.
  All dreams, as in old Galen I have read,            
  Are from repletion and complexion bred;
  From rising fumes of indigested food,
  And noxious humours that infect the blood:
  And sure, my lord, if I can read aright,
  These foolish fancies you have had to-night
  Are certain symptoms (in the canting style)
  Of boiling choler, and abounding bile;
  This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats,
  Engenders all these visionary thoughts.
  When choler overflows, then dreams are bred         
  Of flames, and all the family of red;
  Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view,
  For humours are distinguish'd by their hue.
  From hence we dream of wars and warlike things,
  And wasps and hornets with their double wings.

RHYME a a *

  Choler adust congeals our blood with fear,
  Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear.
  In sanguine airy dreams, aloft we bound;
  With rheums oppress'd, we sink in rivers drown'd.
  More I could say, but thus conclude my theme,       
  The dominating humour makes the dream.
  Cato was in his time accounted wise,
  And he condemns them all for empty lies.

RHYME a a a

  Take my advice, and when we fly to ground,
  With laxatives preserve your body sound,
  And purge the peccant humours that abound.

RHYME a a *

  I should be loath to lay you on a bier;
  And though there lives no pothecary near,
  I dare for once prescribe for your disease,
  And save long bills, and a damn'd doctor's fees.    
  Two sovereign herbs, which I by practice know,
  And both at hand (for in our yard they grow),
  On peril of my soul shall rid you wholly
  Of yellow choler, and of melancholy:
  You must both purge, and vomit; but obey,
  And for the love of heaven make no delay.

RHYME a a *

  Since hot and dry in your complexion join,
  Beware the sun when in a vernal sign;
  For when he mounts exalted in the Ram,
  If then he finds your body in a flame,              
  Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat,
  A tertian ague is at least your lot.
  Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend!)
  May bring your youth to some untimely end:
  And therefore, sir, as you desire to live,
  A day or two before your laxative,
  Take just three worms, nor under nor above,
  Because the gods unequal numbers love,
  These digestives prepare you for your purge;
  Of fumetory, centaury, and spurge,                  
  And of ground ivy add a leaf or two,--
  All which within our yard or garden grow.
  Eat these, and be, my lord, of better cheer;
  Your father's son was never born to fear.

RHYME a a *

    Madam, quoth he, gramercy for your care,
  But Cato, whom you quoted, you may spare:
  'Tis true, a wise and worthy man he seems,
  And (as you say) gave no belief to dreams:
  But other men of more authority,
  And, by the immortal powers! as wise as he,         
  Maintain, with sounder sense, that dreams forebode;
  For Homer plainly says they come from God.
  Nor Cato said it: but some modern fool
  Imposed in Cato's name on boys at school.
  Believe me, madam, morning dreams foreshow
  The events of things, and future weal or woe:
  Some truths are not by reason to be tried,
  But we have sure experience for our guide.
  An ancient author, equal with the best,
  Relates this tale of dreams among the rest.         

RHYME a a *

    Two friends or brothers, with devout intent,
  On some far pilgrimage together went.
  It happen'd so that, when the sun was down,
  They just arrived by twilight at a town;
  That day had been the baiting of a bull,
  'Twas at a feast, and every inn so full,
  That no void room in chamber, or on ground,
  And but one sorry bed was to be found:
  And that so little it would hold but one,
  Though till this hour they never lay alone.         
  So were they forced to part; one staid behind,
  His fellow sought what lodging he could find:
  At last he found a stall where oxen stood,
  And that he rather chose than lie abroad.
  'Twas in a farther yard without a door;
  But, for his ease, well litter'd was the floor.
  His fellow, who the narrow bed had kept,
  Was weary, and without a rocker slept:

RHYME a a *

  Supine he snored; but in the dead of night
  He dream'd his friend appear'd before his sight,    
  Who, with a ghastly look and doleful cry,
  Said, Help me, brother, or this night I die:
  Arise, and help, before all help be vain,
  Or in an ox's stall I shall be slain.
  Roused from his rest, he waken'd in a start,
  Shivering with horror, and with aching heart;

RHYME a a a

  At length to cure himself by reason tries;
  'Tis but a dream, and what are dreams but lies?
  So thinking, changed his side, and closed his eyes.

RHYME a a a

  His dream returns; his friend appears again:        
  The murderers come, now help, or I am slain:
  'Twas but a vision still, and visions are but vain.

RHYME a a *

  He dream'd the third: but now his friend appear'd
  Pale, naked, pierced with wounds, with blood besmear'd:
  Thrice warn'd, awake, said he; relief is late,
  The deed is done; but thou revenge my fate:

RHYME a a *

  Tardy of aid, unseal thy heavy eyes;
  Awake, and with the dawning day arise:
  Take to the western gate thy ready way,
  For by that passage they my corpse convey:          
  My corpse is in a tumbril laid, among
  The filth and ordure, and enclosed with dung;
  That cart arrest, and raise a common cry;
  For sacred hunger of my gold, I die:
  Then show'd his grisly wound; and last he drew
  A piteous sigh, and took a long adieu.

RHYME a a *

    The frighted friend arose by break of day,
  And found the stall where late his fellow lay.
  Then of his impious host inquiring more,
  Was answer'd that his guest was gone before:        
  Muttering he went, said he, by morning light,
  And much complain'd of his ill rest by night.

RHYME a a a

  This raised suspicion in the pilgrim's mind;
  Because all hosts are of an evil kind,
  And oft to share the spoils with robbers join'd.

RHYME a a *

    His dream confirm'd his thought: with troubled look
  Straight to the western gate his way he took:
  There, as his dream foretold, a cart he found,
  That carried compost forth to dung the ground.
  This when the pilgrim saw, he stretch'd his throat, 
  And cried out murder with a yelling note.
  My murder'd fellow in this cart lies dead,
  Vengeance and justice on the villain's head;
  You, magistrates, who sacred laws dispense,
  On you I call to punish this offence.

RHYME a a *

    The word thus given, within a little space
  The mob came roaring out, and throng'd the place.

RHYME a a a

  All in a trice they cast the cart to ground,
  And in the dung the murder'd body found;
  Though breathless, warm, and reeking from the wound.

RHYME a a *

  Good Heaven, whose darling attribute we find
  Is boundless grace and mercy to mankind,            
  Abhors the cruel; and the deeds of night
  By wondrous ways reveals in open light:
  Murder may pass unpunish'd for a time,
  But tardy justice will o'ertake the crime.

RHYME a a *

  And oft a speedier pain the guilty feels;
  The hue and cry of Heaven pursues him at the heels,

RHYME a a a

  Fresh from the fact; as in the present case,
  The criminals are seized upon the place:            
  Carter and host confronted face to face.

RHYME a a *

  Stiff in denial, as the law appoints,
  On engines they distend their tortured joints:
  So was confession forced, the offence was known,
  And public justice on the offenders done.

RHYME a a b b c c c

    Here may you see that visions are to dread;
  And in the page that follows this, I read
  Of two young merchants, whom the hope of gain
  Induced in partnership to cross the main:
  Waiting till willing winds their sails supplied,    
  Within a trading town they long abide,
  Full fairly situate on a haven's side.

RHYME a a *

    One evening it befell, that, looking out,
  The wind they long had wish'd was come about:
  Well pleased, they went to rest; and if the gale
  Till morn continued, both resolved to sail.
  But as together in a bed they lay,
  The younger had a dream at break of day.
  A man he thought stood frowning at his side:
  Who warn'd him for his safety to provide,           
  Nor put to sea, but safe on shore abide.
  I come, thy Genius, to command thy stay;
  Trust not the winds, for fatal is the day,
  And death unhoped attends the watery way.
  The vision said; and vanish'd from his sight:
  The dreamer waken'd in a mortal fright:

RHYME a a *

  Then pull'd his drowsy neighbour, and declared
  What in his slumber he had seen and heard.
  His friend smiled scornful, and with proud contempt
  Rejects as idle what his fellow dreamt.             
  Stay, who will stay: for me no fears restrain,
  Who follow Mercury, the god of gain;
  Let each man do as to his fancy seems,
  I wait, not I, till you have better dreams.

RHYME a a *

  Dreams are but interludes which fancy makes;
  When monarch Reason sleeps, this mimic wakes:
  Compounds a medley of disjointed things,
  A mob of cobblers, and a court of kings:
  Light fumes are merry, grosser fumes are sad:
  Both are the reasonable soul run mad:               
  And many monstrous forms in sleep we see,
  That neither were, nor are, nor e'er can be.
  Sometimes forgotten things, long cast behind,
  Rush forward in the brain, and come to mind.
  The nurse's legends are for truths received,
  And the man dreams but what the boy believed.

RHYME a a a b b c c 

    Sometimes we but rehearse a former play,
  The night restores our actions done by day;
  As hounds in sleep will open for their prey.
  In short, the farce of dreams is of a piece:        
  Chimeras all; and more absurd, or less:
  You, who believe in tales, abide alone;
  Whate'er I get this voyage is my own.

RHYME a a *

    Thus while he spoke, he heard the shouting crew
  That call'd aboard, and took his last adieu.
  The vessel went before a merry gale,
  And for quick passage put on every sail:
  But when least fear'd, and even in open day,
  The mischief overtook her in the way:
  Whether she sprung a leak, I cannot find,           
  Or whether she was overset with wind,
  Or that some rock below her bottom rent;
  But down at once with all her crew she went:
  Her fellow ships from far her loss descried;
  But only she was sunk, and all were safe beside.

RHYME a a *

    By this example you are taught again,
  That dreams and visions are not always vain:
  But if, dear Partlet, you are still in doubt,
  Another tale shall make the former out.

    Kenelm, the son of Kenulph, Mercia's king,        
  Whose holy life the legends loudly sing,
  Warn'd in a dream, his murder did foretell

  All circumstances to his nurse he told,

  From treason counsell'd him to guard his life;
  But close to keep the secret in his mind,
  For a boy's vision small belief would find.
  The pious child, by promise bound, obey'd,          
  Nor was the fatal murder long delay'd:
  By Quenda slain, he fell before his time,
  Made a young martyr by his sister's crime.
  The tale is told by venerable Bede,
  Which, at your better leisure, you may read.

    Macrobius, too, relates the vision sent
  To the great Scipio, with the famed event:
  Objections makes, but after makes replies,
  And adds, that dreams are often prophecies.

    Of Daniel you may read in holy writ,              
  Who, when the king his vision did forget,
  Could word for word the wondrous dream repeat.
  Nor less of patriarch Joseph understand,
  Who by a dream enslaved the Egyptian land,
  The years of plenty and of dearth foretold,
  When, for their bread, their liberty they sold.
  Nor must the exalted butler be forgot,
  Nor he whose dream presaged his hanging lot.

    And did not Croesus the same death foresee,
  Raised in his vision on a lofty tree?               
  The wife of Hector, in his utmost pride,
  Dream'd of his death the night before he died;
  Well was he warn'd from battle to refrain,
  But men to death decreed are warn'd in vain:
  He dared the dream, and by his fatal foe was slain.

    Much more I know, which I forbear to speak,
  For, see, the ruddy day begins to break;
  Let this suffice, that plainly I foresee
  My dream was bad, and bodes adversity:
  But neither pills nor laxatives I like,             
  They only serve to make the well-man sick:
  Of these his gain the sharp physician makes,
  And often gives a purge, but seldom takes:
  They not correct, but poison all the blood,
  And ne'er did any but the doctors good.
  Their tribe, trade, trinkets, I defy them all;
  With every work of pothecary's hall.
  These melancholy matters I forbear:
  But let me tell thee, Partlet mine, and swear,
  That when I view the beauties of thy face,          
  I fear not death, nor dangers, nor disgrace:

RHYME a a b b b 

  So may my soul have bliss, as when I spy
  The scarlet red about thy partridge eye,
  While thou art constant to thy own true knight,
  While thou art mine, and I am thy delight,
  All sorrows at thy presence take their flight.

  For true it is, as _in principio,
  Mulier est hominis confusio_.
  Madam, the meaning of this Latin is,
  That woman is to man his sovereign bliss.           
  For when by night I feel your tender side,
  Though for the narrow perch I cannot ride,

RHYME a a *

  Yet I have such a solace in my mind,
  That all my boding cares are cast behind;
  And even already I forget my dream.
  He said, and downward flew from off the beam;
  For daylight now began apace to spring,
  The thrush to whistle, and the lark to sing;
  Then, crowing, clapp'd his wings, the appointed call,
  To chuck his wives together in the hall.            

RHYME a a *

    By this the widow had unbarr'd the door,
  And Chanticleer went strutting out before.
  With royal courage, and with heart so light,
  As show'd he scorned the visions of the night.
  Now roaming in the yard, he spurn'd the ground,
  And gave to Partlet the first grain he found;

RHYME a a *

  Then often feather'd her with wanton play,
  And trod her twenty times ere prime of day;
  And took by turns, and gave, so much delight,
  Her sisters pined with envy at the sight.           
  He chuck'd again, when other corns he found,
  And scarcely deign'd to set a foot to ground;
  But swagger'd like a lord about his hall,
  And his seven wives came running at his call.

    'Twas now the month in which the world began,
  (If March beheld the first created man):
  And since the vernal equinox, the sun,
  In Aries twelve degrees, or more, had run;
  When, casting up his eyes against the light,
  Both month, and day, and hour he measured right;    
  And told more truly than the Ephemeris:
  For art may err, but nature cannot miss.
  Thus numbering times and seasons in his breast,
  His second crowing the third hour confess'd.
  Then turning, said to Partlet, See, my dear,
  How lavish nature has adorn'd the year;

RHYME a a *

  How the pale primrose and blue violet spring,
  And birds essay their throats disused to sing:
  All these are ours; and I with pleasure see
  Man strutting on two legs, and aping me:            
  An unfledged creature, of a lumpish frame,
  Endow'd with fewer particles of flame;
  Our dame sits cowering o'er a kitchen fire,
  I draw fresh air, and nature's works admire:
  And even this day in more delight abound,
  Than, since I was an egg, I ever found.

RHYME a a b b b c c 

    The time shall come when Chanticleer shall wish
  His words unsaid, and hate his boasted bliss:
  The crested bird shall by experience know,
  Jove made not him his masterpiece below;            
  And learn the latter end of joy is woe.
  The vessel of his bliss to dregs is run,
  And Heaven will have him taste his other tun.

    Ye wise, draw near, and hearken to my tale,
  Which proves that oft the proud by flattery fall:
  The legend is as true, I undertake,
  As Tristran is, and Launcelot of the lake:
  Which all our ladies in such reverence hold,
  As if in Book of Martyrs it were told.

RHYME a a b b c c c d d e e 

    A fox, full-fraught with seeming sanctity,        
  That fear'd an oath, but, like the devil, would lie;
  Who look'd like Lent, and had the holy leer,
  And durst not sin before he said his prayer;
  This pious cheat, that never suck'd the blood,
  Nor chew'd the flesh of lambs, but when he could,
  Had pass'd three summers in the neighbouring wood:
  And musing long, whom next to circumvent,
  On Chanticleer his wicked fancy bent;
  And in his high imagination cast,
  By stratagem, to gratify his taste.                 

RHYME a a *

      The plot contrived, before the break of day
  Saint Reynard through the hedge had made his way;
  The pale was next, but proudly with a bound
  He leapt the fence of the forbidden ground:
  Yet fearing to be seen, within a bed
  Of coleworts he conceal'd his wily head;
  Then skulk'd till afternoon, and watch'd his time
  (As murderers use) to perpetrate his crime.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f 

    Oh, hypocrite, ingenious to destroy!
  Oh, traitor, worse than Sinon was to Troy!          
  Oh, vile subverter of the Gallic reign,
  More false than Gano was to Charlemagne!
  Oh, Chanticleer, in an unhappy hour
  Didst thou forsake the safety of thy bower!
  Better for thee thou hadst believed thy dream,
  And not that day descended from the beam.
  But here the doctors eagerly dispute:
  Some hold predestination absolute;
  Some clerks maintain, that Heaven at first foresees,
  And in the virtue of foresight decrees.             

RHYME a a *

  If this be so, then prescience binds the will,
  And mortals are not free to good or ill;
  For what he first foresaw, he must ordain,
  Or its eternal prescience may be vain:
  As bad for us as prescience had not been:
  For first, or last, he's author of the sin.
  And who says that, let the blaspheming man
  Say worse even of the devil, if he can.
  For how can that Eternal Power be just
  To punish man, who sins because he must?            
  Or, how can he reward a virtuous deed,
  Which is not done by us; but first decreed?

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

    I cannot bolt this matter to the bran,
  As Bradwardin and holy Austin can;
  If prescience can determine actions so
  That we must do, because he did foreknow,
  Or that, foreknowing, yet our choice is free,
  Not forced to sin by strict necessity;
  This strict necessity they simple call,
  Another sort there is conditional.                  

RHYME a a b b b c c d d e e 

  The first so binds the will, that things foreknown
  By spontaneity, not choice, are done.
  Thus galley-slaves tug willing at their oar,
  Content to work, in prospect of the shore;
  But would not work at all if not constrain'd before.
  That other does not liberty constrain,
  But man may either act, or may refrain.
  Heaven made us agents free to good or ill,
  And forced it not, though he foresaw the will.
  Freedom was first bestow'd on human race,           
  And prescience only held the second place.

RHYME a a b b c c c d d e e f f 

    If he could make such agents wholly free,
  I not dispute, the point's too high for me;
  For Heaven's unfathom'd power what man can sound,
  Or put to his Omnipotence a bound?
  He made us to his image, all agree;
  That image is the soul, and that must be,
  Or not, the Maker's image, or be free.
  But whether it were better man had been
  By nature bound to good, not free to sin,           
  I waive, for fear of splitting on a rock,
  The tale I tell is only of a cock;
  Who had not run the hazard of his life,
  Had he believed his dream, and not his wife:

RHYME a a *

  For women, with a mischief to their kind,
  Pervert with bad advice our better mind.
  A woman's counsel brought us first to woe,
  And made her man his paradise forego,
  Where at heart's ease he lived; and might have been
  As free from sorrow as he was from sin.             
  For what the devil had their sex to do,
  That, born to folly, they presumed to know,
  And could not see the serpent in the grass?
  But I myself presume, and let it pass.

RHYME a a *

    Silence in times of suffering is the best,
  'Tis dangerous to disturb an hornet's nest.
  In other authors you may find enough,
  But all they say of dames is idle stuff:            
  Legends of lying wits together bound,
  The Wife of Bath would throw them to the ground;
  These are the words of Chanticleer, not mine;
  I honour dames, and think their sex divine.

RHYME a a b b c c c 

    Now to continue what my tale begun:
  Lay Madam Partlet basking in the sun,
  Breast-high in sand: her sisters in a row
  Enjoy'd the beams above, the warmth below;
  The cock, that of his flesh was ever free,
  Sung merrier than the mermaid in the sea:
  And so befell, that as he cast his eye

RHYME a b b c c d d e e f f 

  Among the coleworts on a butterfly,                 
  He saw false Reynard where he lay full low:
  I need not swear he had no list to crow:
  But cried _cock, cock_, and gave a sudden start,
  As sore dismay'd, and frighted at his heart:
  For birds and beasts, inform'd by nature, know
  Kinds opposite to theirs, and fly their foe;
  So Chanticleer, who never saw a fox,
  Yet shunn'd him as a sailor shuns the rocks.
  But the false loon, who could not work his will
  But open force, employ'd his flattering skill;      

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e 

  I hope, my lord, said he, I not offend;
  Are you afraid of me, that am your friend?
  I were a beast indeed to do you wrong,
  I, who have loved and honour'd you so long:
  Stay, gentle sir, nor take a false alarm,
  For, on my soul, I never meant you harm.
  I come no spy, nor as a traitor press,
  To learn the secrets of your soft recess:
  Far be from Reynard so profane a thought,
  But by the sweetness of your voice was brought:     

RHYME a a b b c c c 

  For, as I bid my beads, by chance I heard
  The song as of an angel in the yard;
  A song that would have charm'd the infernal gods,
  And banish'd horror from the dark abodes:
  Had Orpheus sung it in the nether sphere,
  So much the hymn had pleased the tyrant's ear,
  The wife had been detain'd, to keep the husband there.

RHYME a a b b c c 

    My lord, your sire familiarly I knew,
  A peer deserving such a son as you:
  He, with your lady-mother (whom Heaven rest!)       
  Has often graced my house, and been my guest;
  To view his living features does me good,
  For I am your poor neighbour in the wood;

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

  And in my cottage should be proud to see
  The worthy heir of my friend's family.
  But since I speak of singing, let me say,
  As with an upright heart I safely may,
  That, save yourself, there breathes not on the ground
  One like your father for a silver sound.
  So sweetly would he wake the winter day,            
  That matrons to the church mistook their way,
  And thought they heard the merry organ play.

RHYME a a *

  And he, to raise his voice, with artful care,
  (What will not beaux attempt to please the fair?)
  On tiptoe stood to sing with greater strength,
  And stretch'd his comely neck at all the length:
  And while he strain'd his voice to pierce the skies,
  As saints in raptures use, would shut his eyes,

RHYME a a *

  That the sound striving through the narrow throat,
  His winking might avail to mend the note,           
  By this, in song, he never had his peer,
  From sweet Cecilia down to Chanticleer;
  Nor Maro's muse, who sung the mighty Man,
  Nor Pindar's heavenly lyre, nor Horace when a swan.
  Your ancestors proceed from race divine:
  From Brennus and Belinus is your line;
  Who gave to sovereign Rome such loud alarms,
  That even the priests were not excused from arms.

    Besides, a famous monk of modern times
  Has left of cocks recorded in his rhymes,           
  That of a parish priest the son and heir
  (When sons of priests were from the proverb clear),
  Affronted once a cock of noble kind,
  And either lamed his legs, or struck him blind;
  For which the clerk his father was disgraced,
  And in his benefice another placed.
  Now sing, my lord, if not for love of me,
  Yet for the sake of sweet Saint Charity;
  Make hills and dales, and earth and heaven rejoice,
  And emulate your father's angel-voice.

    The cock was pleased to hear him speak so fair,
  And proud beside, as solar people are;
  Nor could the treason from the truth descry,
  So was he ravish'd with this flattery;
  So much the more, as from a little elf
  He had a high opinion of himself;
  Though sickly, slender, and not large of limb,
  Concluding all the world was made for him.

    Ye princes, raised by poets to the gods,
  And Alexander'd[g b ] up in lying odes!

  And he shall be received with more regard,

    This Chanticleer, of whom the story sings,
  Stood high upon his toes, and clapp'd his wings;
  Then stretch'd his neck, and wink d with both his eyes,
  Ambitious as he sought the Olympic prize.
  But while he pain'd himself to raise his note,
  False Renyard rush'd and caught him by the throat.  
  Then on his back he laid the precious load,
  And sought his wonted shelter of the wood;
  Swiftly he made his way the mischief done,
  Of all unheeded, and pursued by none.

    Alas, what stay is there in human state!
  Or who can shun inevitable fate?
  The doom was written, the decree was pass'd,

  In Aries though the sun exalted stood,
  His patron-planet, to procure his good;             
  Yet Saturn was his mortal foe, and he,
  In Libra raised, opposed the same degree:
  The rays both good and bad, of equal power,
  Each thwarting other, made a mingled hour.

  And offer'd Priam to his father's shade,

  Fair Partlet first, when he was borne from sight,
  With sovereign shrieks bewail'd her captive knight:
  Far louder than the Carthaginian wife,
  When Asdrubal, her husband, lost his life;
  When she beheld the smouldering flames ascend,
  And all the Punic glories at an end:

    Now to my story I return again:
  The trembling widow, and her daughters twain,
  This woful cackling cry with horror heard,
  Of those distracted damsels in the yard;
  And starting up beheld the heavy sight,             
  How Reynard to the forest took his flight,
  And 'cross his back, as in triumphant scorn,
  The hope and pillar of the house was borne.

RHYME a a *

    The fox! the wicked fox! was all the cry;
  Out from his house ran every neighbour nigh:
  The vicar first, and after him the crew,
  With forks and staves the felon to pursue.
  Ran Coll our dog, and Talbot with the band,
  And Malkin, with her distaff in her hand:
  Ran cow and calf, and family of hogs,               
  In panic horror of pursuing dogs;
  With many a deadly grunt and doleful squeak,
  Poor swine, as if their pretty hearts would break.

RHYME a a *

  The shouts of men, the women in dismay,
  With shrieks augment the terror of the day.
  The ducks that heard the proclamation cried,
  And fear'd a persecution might betide,
  Full twenty miles from town their voyage take,
  Obscure in rushes of the liquid lake.
  The geese fly o'er the barn; the bees in arms       
  Drive headlong from their waxen cells in swarms.
  Jack Straw at London-stone, with all his rout,
  Struck not the city with so loud a shout;

  A Frenchman, or an unbelieving Jew:
  Not when the welkin rung with 'one and all;'
  And echoes bounded back from Fox's hall:
  Earth seem'd to sink beneath, and heaven above to fall.
  With might and main they chased the murderous fox,
  With brazen trumpets, and inflated box,             
  To kindle Mars with military sounds,
  Nor wanted horns to inspire sagacious hounds.

    But see how Fortune can confound the wise,
  And when they least expect it, turn the dice!
  The captive-cock, who scarce could draw his breath,
  And lay within the very jaws of death;
  Yet in this agony his fancy wrought,
  And fear supplied him with this happy thought:

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

    Yours is the prize, victorious prince! said he,
  The vicar my defeat, and all the village see.       
  Enjoy your friendly fortune while you may,
  And bid the churls that envy you the prey
  Call back their mongrel curs, and cease their cry,
  See, fools, the shelter of the wood is nigh,
  And Chanticleer in your despite shall die,
  He shall be pluck'd and eaten to the bone.
    'Tis well advised, in faith it shall be done;

  This Reynard said: but as the word he spoke,
  The prisoner with a spring from prison broke;
  Then stretch'd his feather'd fans with all his might,   
  And to the neighbouring maple wing'd his flight;
  Whom, when the traitor safe on tree beheld,
  He cursed the gods, with shame and sorrow fill'd:
  Shame for his folly, sorrow out of time,
  For plotting an unprofitable crime;
  Yet mastering both, the artificer of lies
  Renews the assault, and his last battery tries.

    Though I, said he, did ne'er in thought offend,
  How justly may my lord suspect his friend?
  The appearance is against me, I confess,            
  Who seemingly have put you in distress:
  You, if your goodness does not plead my cause,
  May think I broke all hospitable laws,
  To bear you from your palace-yard by might,
  And put your noble person in a fright:

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

  This, since you take it ill, I must repent,
  Though, Heaven can witness, with no bad intent:
  I practised it, to make you taste your cheer
  With double pleasure, first prepared by fear.
  So loyal subjects often seize their prince,         
  Forced (for his good) to seeming violence,
  Yet mean his sacred person not the least offence.
  Descend; so help me Jove, as you shall find,
  That Reynard comes of no dissembling kind.

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

    Nay, quoth the Cock, but I beshrew us both,
  If I believe a saint upon his oath:
  An honest man may take a knave's advice,
  But idiots only may be cozen'd twice:
  Once warn'd is well bewared; no nattering lies
  Shall soothe me more to sing with winking eyes,     
  And open mouth, for fear of catching flies.
  Who blindfold walks upon a river's brim,
  When he should see, has he deserved to swim?

RHYME a a b b c c 

    Better, Sir Cock, let all contention cease,
  Come down, said Reynard, let us treat of peace.
  A peace with all my soul, said Chanticleer;
  But, with your favour, I will treat it here:
  And, lest the truce with treason should be mix'd,
  'Tis my concern to have the tree betwixt.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e e 

    In this plain fable you the effect may see        
  Of negligence, and fond credulity:
  And learn besides of flatterers to beware,
  Then most pernicious when they speak too fair.
  The cock and fox, the fool and knave imply;
  The truth is moral, though the tale a lie.
  Who spoke in parables, I dare not say;
  But sure he knew it was a pleasing way,
  Sound sense, by plain example, to convey.
  And in a heathen author we may find,
  That pleasure with instruction should be join'd;    
  So take the corn, and leave the chaff behind.

  Now turning from the wintry signs, the sun,
  His course exalted, through the Ram had run,
  And whirling up the skies, his chariot drove

  Where Venus from her orb descends in showers,
  To glad the ground, and paint the fields with flowers:
  When first the tender blades of grass appear,
  And buds, that yet the blast of Eurus fear,
  Stand at the door of life, and doubt to clothe the year:

  Till gentle heat, and soft repeated rains,                
  Make the green blood to dance within their veins:
  Then, at their call, embolden'd out they come,
  And swell the gems, and burst the narrow room;
  Broader and broader yet, their blooms display,
  Salute the welcome sun, and entertain the day.
  Then from their breathing souls the sweets repair
  To scent the skies, and purge the unwholesome air:
  Joy spreads the heart, and, with a general song,
  Spring issues out, and leads the jolly months along.

    In that sweet season, as in bed I lay,                  
  And sought in sleep to pass the night away,
  I turn'd my weary side, but still in vain,
  Though full of youthful health, and void of pain:
  Cares I had none, to keep me from my rest,
  For love had never enter'd in my breast;
  I wanted nothing fortune could supply,
  Nor did she slumber till that hour deny.
  I wonder'd then, but after found it true,
  Much joy had dried away the balmy dew:
  Seas would be pools, without the brushing air             
  To curl the waves; and sure some little care
  Should weary nature so, to make her want repair.

    When Chanticleer the second watch had sung,
  Scorning the scorner sleep, from bed I sprung;
  And dressing, by the moon, in loose array,
  Pass'd out in open air, preventing day,
  And sought a goodly grove, as fancy led my way.
  Straight as a line in beauteous order stood
  Of oaks unshorn a venerable wood;
  Fresh was the grass beneath, and every tree,              
  At distance planted in a due degree,
  Their branching arms in air with equal space
  Stretch'd to their neighbours with a long embrace:
  And the new leaves on every bough were seen,
  Some ruddy colour'd, some of lighter green.

RHYME a a *

  The painted birds, companions of the spring,
  Hopping from spray to spray, were heard to sing.
  Both eyes and ears received a like delight,
  Enchanting music, and a charming sight.
  On Philomel I fix'd my whole desire,                      
  And listen'd for the queen of all the quire;
  Fain would I hear her heavenly voice to sing;
  And wanted yet an omen to the spring.

RHYME a a *

    Attending long in vain, I took the way
  Which through a path but scarcely printed lay;
  In narrow mazes oft it seem'd to meet,
  And look'd as lightly press'd by fairy feet.
  Wandering I walk'd alone, for still methought
  To some strange end so strange a path was wrought:
  At last it led me where an arbour stood,                  
  The sacred receptacle of the wood:

RHYME a a *

  This place unmark'd, though oft I walk'd the green,
  In all my progress I had never seen:
  And seized at once with wonder and delight,
  Gazed all around me, new to the transporting sight.
  'Twas bench'd with turf, and goodly to be seen,
  The thick young grass arose in fresher green:
  The mound was newly made, no sight could pass
  Betwixt the nice partitions of the grass,
  The well-united sods so closely lay;                      
  And all around the shades defended it from day;

RHYME a a *

  For sycamores with eglantine were spread,
  A hedge about the sides, a covering overhead.
  And so the fragrant brier was wove between,
  The sycamore and flowers were mixed with green,
  That nature seem'd to vary the delight,
  And satisfied at once the smell and sight.
  The master workman of the bower was known
  Through fairy-lands, and built for Oberon;
  Who twining leaves with such proportion drew,             
  They rose by measure, and by rule they grew;
  No mortal tongue can half the beauty tell;
  For none but hands divine could work so well.
  Both roof and sides were like a parlour made,
  A soft recess, and a cool summer shade;

RHYME a a *

  The hedge was set so thick, no foreign eye
  The persons placed within it could espy;
  But all that pass'd without with ease was seen,
  As if nor fence nor tree was placed between.
  'Twas border'd with a field; and some was plain           
  With grass, and some was sow'd with rising grain.
  That (now the dew with spangles deck'd the ground)
  A sweeter spot of earth was never found.

RHYME a a *

  I look'd, and look'd, and still with new delight;
  Such joy my soul, such pleasures fill'd my sight;
  And the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath,
  Whose odours were of power to raise from death.
  Nor sullen discontent, nor anxious care,
  Even though brought thither, could inhabit there:
  But thence they fled as from their mortal foe;      
  For this sweet place could only pleasure know.

RHYME a a *

    Thus as I mused, I cast aside my eye,
  And saw a medlar-tree was planted nigh.
  The spreading branches made a goodly show,
  And full of opening blooms was every bough:
  A goldfinch there I saw, with gaudy pride
  Of painted plumes, that hopp'd from side to side,
  Still pecking as she pass'd; and still she drew
  The sweets from every flower, and suck'd the dew:
  Sufficed at length, she warbled in her throat,      
  And tuned her voice to many a merry note,
  But indistinct, and neither sweet nor clear,
  Yet such as soothed my soul, and pleased my ear.

RHYME a a *

    Her short performance was no sooner tried,
  When she I sought, the nightingale, replied:
  So sweet, so shrill, so variously she sung,
  That the grove echoed, and the valleys rung;
  And I so ravish'd with her heavenly note,
  I stood entranced, and had no room for thought,
  But all o'er-power'd with ecstasy of bliss,         
  Was in a pleasing dream of paradise.
  At length I waked, and looking round the bower,
  Search'd every tree, and pry'd on every flower,
  If any where by chance I might espy
  The rural poet of the melody;
  For still methought she sung not far away:
  At last I found her on a laurel spray.
  Close by my side she sat, and fair in sight,
  Full in a line, against her opposite;
  Where stood with eglantine the laurel twined;       
  And both their native sweets were well conjoin'd.

RHYME a a *

    On the green bank I sat, and listen'd long;
  (Sitting was more convenient for the song):
  Nor till her lay was ended could I move,
  But wish'd to dwell for ever in the grove.
  Only methought the time too swiftly pass'd,
  And every note I fear'd would be the last.
  My sight and smell, and hearing were employ'd,
  And all three senses in full gust enjoy'd.
  And what alone did all the rest surpass,            
  The sweet possession of the fairy place;
  Single, and conscious to myself alone
  Of pleasures to the excluded world unknown:
  Pleasures which nowhere else were to be found,
  And all Elysium in a spot of ground.

RHYME a a b b c c c d d e e 

    Thus while I sat intent to see and hear,
  And drew perfumes of more than vital air,
  All suddenly I heard the approaching sound
  Of vocal music on the enchanted ground:
  A host of saints it seem'd, so full the quire;      
  As if the bless'd above did all conspire
  To join their voices, and neglect the lyre.
  At length there issued from the grove behind
  A fair assembly of the female kind:
  A train less fair, as ancient fathers tell,
  Seduced the sons of heaven to rebel.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e 

  I pass their form, and every charming grace,
  Less than an angel would their worth debase:
  But their attire, like liveries of a kind,
  All rich and rare, is fresh within my mind.         
  In velvet white as snow the troop was gown'd,
  The seams with sparkling emeralds set around;
  Their hoods and sleeves the same; and purfled o'er
  With diamonds, pearls, and all the shining store
  Of eastern pomp: their long descending train,
  With rubies edged, and sapphires, swept the plain:

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e 

  High on their heads, with jewels richly set,
  Each lady wore a radiant coronet.
  Beneath the circles, all the quire was graced
  With chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed: 
  Of laurel some, of woodbine many more;
  And wreaths of Agnus castus[g e ] others bore;
  These last, who with those virgin crowns were dress'd,
  Appear'd in higher honour than the rest.
  They danced around: but in the midst was seen
  A lady of a more majestic mien;
  By stature, and by beauty mark'd their sovereign queen

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f g g 

    She in the midst began with sober grace;
  Her servants' eyes were fix'd upon her face;
  And as she moved or turn'd, her motions view'd,     
  Her measures kept, and step by step pursued.
  Methought she trod the ground with greater grace,
  With more of godhead shining in her face;
  And as in beauty she surpass'd the quire,
  So, nobler than the rest, was her attire.
  A crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow,
  Plain without pomp, and rich without a show:
  A branch of Agnus castus in her hand
  She bore aloft (her sceptre of command);
  Admired, adored by all the circling crowd,          
  For wheresoe'er she turn'd her face, they bow'd:

RHYME a a b b b c c d d 

  And as she danced, a roundelay she sung,
  In honour of the laurel, ever young:
  She raised her voice on high, and sung so clear,
  The fawns came scudding from the groves to hear:
  And all the bending forest lent an ear.
  At every close she made, the attending throng
  Replied, and bore the burden of the song:
  So just, so small, yet in so sweet a note,
  It seem'd the music melted in the throat.           

RHYME a a *

    Thus dancing on, and singing as they danced,
  They to the middle of the mead advanced,
  Till round my arbour a new ring they made,
  And footed it about the sacred shade.
  O'erjoy'd to see the jolly troops so near,
  But somewhat awed, I shook with holy fear;
  Yet not so much, but what I noted well
  Who did the most in song or dance excel.

RHYME a a *

    Not long I had observed, when from afar
  I heard a sudden symphony of war;                   
  The neighing coursers, and the soldiers cry,
  And sounding trumps, that seem'd to tear the sky:
  I saw soon after this, behind the grove
  From whence the ladies did in order move,
  Come issuing out in arms a warrior train,
  That like a deluge pour'd upon the plain;

RHYME a a *

  On barbed steeds they rode in proud array,
  Thick as the college of the bees in May,
  When swarming o'er the dusky fields they fly,
  New to the flowers, and intercept the sky,          
  So fierce they drove, their coursers were so fleet,
  That the turf trembled underneath their feet.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e f f 

    To tell their costly furniture were long,
  The summer's day would end before the song:
  To purchase but the tenth of all their store,
  Would make the mighty Persian monarch poor.
  Yet what I can, I will; before the rest
  The trumpets issued, in white mantles dress'd,
  A numerous troop, and all their heads around
  With chaplets green of cerrial-oak[g f ] were crown'd,
  And at each trumpet was a banner bound;
  Which, waving in the wind, displayed at large
  Their master's coat of arms, and knightly charge.
  Broad were the banners, and of snowy hue,
  A purer web the silk-worm never drew.

RHYME a a *

  The chief about their necks the scutcheons wore,
  With orient pearls and jewels powder'd o'er:
  Broad were their collars too, and every one
  Was set about with many a costly stone.
  Next these, of kings-at-arms a goodly train         
  In proud array came prancing o'er the plain:
  Their cloaks were cloth of silver mix'd with gold,
  And garlands green around their temples roll'd:

RHYME a a *

  Rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed,
  With sapphires, diamonds, and with rubies graced:
  And as the trumpets their appearance made,
  So these in habits were alike array'd;
  But with a pace more sober, and more slow;
  And twenty, rank in rank, they rode a-row.
  The pursuivants came next, in number more;          
  And, like the heralds, each his scutcheon bore:
  Clad in white velvet all their troop they led,
  With each an oaken chaplet on his head.

RHYME a a *

    Nine royal knights in equal rank succeed,
  Each warrior mounted on a fiery steed;
  In golden armour glorious to behold;
  The rivets of their arms were nail'd with gold.
  Their surcoats of white ermine fur were made;
  With cloth of gold between, that cast a glittering shade.
  The trappings of their steeds were of the same;     
  The golden fringe even set the ground on flame,
  And drew a precious trail: a crown divine
  Of laurel did about their temples twine.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e 

    Three henchmen were for every knight assign'd,
  All in rich livery clad, and of a kind;
  White velvet, but unshorn, for cloaks they wore,
  And each within his hand a truncheon bore:
  The foremost held a helm of rare device;
  A prince's ransom would not pay the price.
  The second bore the buckler of his knight,          
  The third of cornel-wood a spear upright,
  Headed with piercing steel, and polish'd bright.
  Like to their lords their equipage was seen,
  And all their foreheads crown'd with garlands green.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e 

    And after these came, arm'd with spear and shield,
  A host so great as cover'd all the field:
  And all their foreheads, like the knights before,
  With laurels ever-green were shaded o'er,
  Or oak, or other leaves of lasting kind,
  Tenacious of the stem, and firm against the wind.   
  Some in their hands, beside the lance and shield,
  The boughs of woodbine, or of hawthorn held,
  Or branches for their mystic emblems took,
  Of palm, of laurel, and of cerrial-oak.

RHYME a a a

    Thus marching to the trumpet's lofty sound,
  Drawn in two lines adverse they wheel'd around,
  And in the middle meadow took their ground.

RHYME a a *

  Among themselves the tourney they divide,
  In equal squadrons ranged on either side.
  Then turn'd their horses' heads, and man to man,    
  And steed to steed opposed, the jousts began.
  They lightly set their lances in the rest,
  And, at the sign, against each other press'd:
  They met. I sitting at my ease beheld
  The mix'd events, and fortunes of the field.

RHYME a a *

  Some broke their spears, some tumbled horse and man,
  And round the field the lighten'd coursers ran.
  An hour and more, like tides, in equal sway
  They rush'd, and won by turns, and lost the day:

RHYME a a a

  At length the nine (who still together held)        
  Their fainting foes to shameful flight compell'd,
  And with resistless force o'er-ran the field.

RHYME a a *

  Thus, to their fame, when finish'd was the fight,
  The victors from their lofty steeds alight:
  Like them dismounted all the warlike train,
  And two by two proceeded o'er the plain,
  Till to the fair assembly they advanced,
  Who near the secret arbour sung and danced.

RHYME a a a

    The ladies left their measures at the sight,
  To meet the chiefs returning from the fight,        
  And each with open arms embraced her chosen knight.
  
RHYME a a *

  Amid the plain a spreading laurel stood,
  The grace and ornament of all the wood:
  That pleasing shade they sought, a soft retreat
  From sudden April showers, a shelter from the heat:
  Her leafy arms with such extent were spread.
  So near the clouds was her aspiring head,
  That hosts of birds, that wing the liquid air,
  Perch'd in the boughs, had nightly lodging there:
  And flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far      
  Might hear the rattling hail, and wintry war;

RHYME a a *

  From heaven's inclemency here found retreat,
  Enjoy'd the cool, and shunn'd the scorching heat:
  A hundred knights might there at ease abide;
  And every knight a lady by his side:
  The trunk itself such odours did bequeath,
  That a Moluccan[g g ] breeze to these was common breath.

RHYME a a a

  The lords and ladies here, approaching, paid
  Their homage, with a low obeisance made;
  And seem'd to venerate the sacred shade.            

RHYME a a *

  These rites perform'd, their pleasures they pursue,
  With song of love, and mix with measures new;
  Around the holy tree their dance they frame,
  And every champion leads his chosen dame.

RHYME a a *

    I cast my sight upon the farther field,
  And a fresh object of delight beheld:
  For from the region of the West I heard
  New music sound, and a new troop appear'd;
  Of knights and ladies mix'd, a jolly band,
  But all on foot they march'd, and hand in hand.     

RHYME a a a

    The ladies dress'd in rich symars were seen
  Of Florence satin, flower'd with white and green,
  And for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin.

RHYME a a *

  The borders of their petticoats below
  Were guarded thick with rubies on a row;
  And every damsel wore upon her head
  Of flowers a garland blended white and red.
  Attired in mantles all the knights were seen,
  That gratified the view with cheerful green:

RHYME a a *

  Their chaplets of their ladies' colours were,       
  Composed of white and red, to shade their shining hair.
  Before the merry troop the minstrels play'd;
  All in their masters' liveries were array'd,
  And clad in green, and on their temples wore
  The chaplets white and red their ladies bore.
  Their instruments were various in their kind,
  Some for the bow, and some for breathing wind;
  The sawtry, pipe, and hautboy's noisy band,
  And the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand.

RHYME a a *

  A tuft of daisies on a flowery lea                  
  They saw, and thitherward they bent their way;
  To this both knights and dames their homage made,
  And due obeisance to the daisy paid.
  And then the band of flutes began to play,
  To which a lady sung a virelay:[g h ]
  And still at every close she would repeat
  The burden of the song, _The daisy is so sweet,
  The daisy is so sweet_: when she begun,
  The troop of knights and dames continued on.
  The concert and the voice so charm'd my ear,
  And soothed my soul, that it was heaven to hear.    

RHYME a a *

    But soon their pleasure pass'd: at noon of day
  The sun with sultry beams began to play:
  Not Sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high,
  When with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky:

RHYME a a a

  Then droop'd the fading flowers (their beauty fled)
  And closed their sickly eyes, and hung the head;
  And rivell'd up with heat, lay dying in their bed.

RHYME a a *

  The ladies gasp'd, and scarcely could respire;
  The breath they drew, no longer air but fire;       
  The fainty knights were scorch'd, and knew not where
  To run for shelter, for no shade was near;
  And after this the gathering clouds amain
  Pour'd down a storm of rattling hail and rain;
  And lightning flash'd betwixt: the field, and flowers,
  Burnt up before, were buried in the showers.

RHYME a a *

  The ladies and the knights, no shelter nigh,
  Bare to the weather and the wintry sky,
  Were drooping wet, disconsolate, and wan,
  And through their thin array received the rain;     
  While those in white, protected by the tree,
  Saw pass in vain the assault, and stood from danger free;
  But as compassion moved their gentle minds,
  When ceased the storm, and silent were the winds,

RHYME a a *

  Displeased at what, not suffering they had seen,
  They went to cheer the faction of the green.
  The queen in white array, before her band,
  Saluting, took her rival by the hand;
  So did the knights and dames, with courtly grace,
  And with behaviour sweet their foes embrace;        
  Then thus the queen with laurel on her brow--
  Fair sister, I have suffer'd in your woe;

RHYME a a *

  Nor shall be wanting aught within my power
  For your relief in my refreshing bower.
  That other answer'd with a lowly look,
  And soon the gracious invitation took:
  For ill at ease both she and all her train
  The scorching sun had borne, and beating rain.
  Like courtesy was used by all in white,
  Each dame a dame received, and every knight a knight.   

RHYME a a *

  The laurel champions with their swords invade
  The neighbouring forests, where the jousts were made,
  And serewood from the rotten hedges took,
  And seeds of latent fire, from flints provoke:
  A cheerful blaze arose, and by the fire
  They warm'd their frozen feet, and dried their wet attire.
  Refresh'd with heat, the ladies sought around
  For virtuous herbs, which, gather'd from the ground,
  They squeezed the juice, and cooling ointment made,
  Which on their sun-burnt cheeks, and their chapt skins they laid:  
  Then sought green salads, which they bade them eat,
  A sovereign remedy for inward heat.

RHYME a a *

    The Lady of the Leaf ordain'd a feast,
  And made the Lady of the Flower her guest:
  When, lo! a bower ascended on the plain,
  With sudden seats ordain'd, and large for either train.
  This bower was near my pleasant arbour placed,
  That I could hear and see whatever pass'd:
  The ladies sat with each a knight between,
  Distinguish'd by their colours, white and green;    

RHYME a a *

  The vanquish'd party with the victors join'd,
  Nor wanted sweet discourse, the banquet of the mind.
  Meantime the minstrels play'd on either side,
  Vain of their art, and for the mastery vied:
  The sweet contention lasted for an hour,
  And reach'd my secret arbour from the bower.

RHYME a a *

    The sun was set; and Vesper, to supply
  His absent beams, had lighted up the sky.
  When Philomel, officious all the day
  To sing the service of the ensuing May,             
  Fled from her laurel shade, and wing'd her flight
  Directly to the queen array'd in white:
  And, hopping, sat familiar on her hand,
  A new musician, and increased the band.

RHYME a a *

    The goldfinch, who, to shun the scalding heat,
  Had changed the medlar for a safer seat,
  And hid in bushes 'scaped the bitter shower,
  Now perch'd upon the Lady of the Flower;
  And either songster holding out their throats,
  And folding up their wings, renew'd their notes:    
  As if all day, precluding to the fight,
  They only had rehearsed, to sing by night.
  The banquet ended, and the battle done,
  They danced by star-light and the friendly moon:
  And when they were to part, the laureate queen
  Supplied with steeds the lady of the green,
  Her and her train conducting on the way,
  The moon to follow, and avoid the day.

RHYME a a *

    This when I saw, inquisitive to know
  The secret moral of the mystic show,                
  I started from my shade, in hopes to find
  Some nymph to satisfy my longing mind:
  And as my fair adventure fell, I found
  A lady all in white, with laurel crown'd,
  Who closed the rear, and softly paced along,
  Repeating to herself the former song.
  With due respect my body I inclined,
  As to some being of superior kind,
  And made my court according to the day,
  Wishing her queen and her a happy May.              
  Great thanks, my daughter, with a gracious bow,
  She said; and I, who much desired to know
  Of whence she was, yet fearful how to break
  My mind, adventured humbly thus to speak:

RHYME a a *

  Madam, might I presume and not offend,
  So may the stars and shining moon attend

RHYME a a a

  Your nightly sports, as you vouchsafe to tell,
  What nymphs they were who mortal forms excel,
  And what the knights who fought in listed fields so well.

RHYME a a *

  To this the dame replied: Fair daughter, know,      
  That what you saw was all a fairy show;
  And all those airy shapes you now behold,
  Were human bodies once, and clothed with earthly mould;
  Our souls, not yet prepared for upper light,
  Till doomsday wander in the shades of night;

RHYME a a *

  This only holiday of all the year,
  We privileged in sunshine may appear:
  With songs and dance we celebrate the day,
  And with due honours usher in the May.
  At other times we reign by night alone,             
  And posting through the skies pursue the moon;
  But when the morn arises, none are found;
  For cruel Demogorgon walks the round,
  And if he finds a fairy lag in light,
  He drives the wretch before, and lashes into night.

RHYME a a *

    All courteous are by kind; and ever proud
  With friendly offices to help the good.
  In every land we have a larger space
  Than what is known to you of mortal race;
  Where we with green adorn our fairy bowers,         
  And even this grove, unseen before, is ours.
  Know farther; every lady clothed in white,
  And, crown'd with oak and laurel every knight,
  Are servants to the Leaf, by liveries known
  Of innocence; and I myself am one.
  Saw you not her, so graceful to behold,
  In white attire, and crown'd with radiant gold?
  The sovereign lady of our land is she,
  Diana call'd, the Queen of Chastity:
  And, for the spotless name of maid she bears,       
  That Agnus castus in her hand appears;

RHYME a a *

  And all her train, with leafy chaplets crown'd,
  Were for unblamed virginity renown'd;
  But those the chief and highest in command
  Who bear those holy branches in their hand:

RHYME a a a

  The knights adorn'd with laurel crowns are they,
  Whom death nor danger ever could dismay,
  Victorious names, who made the world obey;

RHYME a a *

  Who, while they lived, in deeds of arms excell'd,
  And after death for deities were held.              
  But those who wear the woodbine on their brow,
  Were knights of love, who never broke their vow;
  Firm to their plighted faith, and ever free
  From fears and fickle chance, and jealousy.
  The lords and ladies, who the woodbine bear,
  As true as Tristram and Isotta were.

RHYME a a *

    But what are those, said I, the unconquer'd nine,
  Who, crown'd with laurel-wreaths, in golden armour shine?
  And who the knights in green, and what the train
  Of ladies dress'd with daisies on the plain?        
  Why both the bands in worship disagree,
  And some adore the flower, and some the tree?

RHYME a a *

    Just is your suit, fair daughter, said the dame:
  Those laurell'd chiefs were men of mighty fame;
  Nine worthies were they call'd of different rites,
  Three Jews, three Pagans, and three Christian knights.

RHYME a a a
 
 These, as you see, ride foremost in the field,
  As they the foremost rank of honour held,
  And all in deeds of chivalry excell'd:

RHYME a a *

  Their temples wreathed with leaves, that still renew;   
  For deathless laurel is the victor's due:
  Who bear the bows were knights in Arthur's reign,
  Twelve they, and twelve the peers of Charlemagne:
  For bows the strength of brawny arms imply,
  Emblems of valour, and of victory.

RHYME a a *

  Behold an order yet of newer date,
  Doubling their number, equal in their state;
  Our England's ornament, the crown's defence,
  In battle brave, protectors of their prince;
  Unchanged by fortune, to their sovereign true,      
  For which their manly legs are bound with blue.

RHYME a a a

  These, of the Garter call'd, of faith unstain'd,
  In fighting fields the laurel have obtain'd,
  And well repaid the honours which they gain'd.

RHYME a a *

  The laurel wreaths were first by Cesar worn,
  And still they Cesar's successors adorn:
  One leaf of this is immortality,
  And more of worth than all the world can buy.

RHYME a a *

    One doubt remains, said I, the dames in green,
  What were their qualities, and who their queen?     
  Flora commands, said she, those nymphs and knights,
  Who lived in slothful ease and loose delights;
  Who never acts of honour durst pursue,
  The men inglorious knights, the ladies all untrue:
  Who, nursed in idleness, and train'd in courts,
  Pass'd all their precious hours in plays, and sports,
  Till death behind came stalking on, unseen,
  And wither'd (like the storm) the freshness of their green.
  These, and their mates, enjoy their present hour,
  And therefore pay their homage to the Flower:       

RHYME a a a

  But knights in knightly deeds should persevere,
  And still continue what at first they were;
  Continue, and proceed in honour's fair career.

RHYME a a *

  No room for cowardice, or dull delay;
  From good to better they should urge their way.
  For this with golden spurs the chiefs are graced,
  With pointed rowels arm'd to mend their haste;

RHYME a a a

  For this with lasting leaves their brows are bound;
  For laurel is the sign of labour crown'd,
  Which bears the bitter blast, nor shaken falls to ground:

RHYME a a *

  From winter winds it suffers no decay,
  For ever fresh and fair, and every month is May.

RHYME a a *

  Even when the vital sap retreats below,
  Even when the hoary head is hid in snow,
  The life is in the Leaf, and still between
  The fits of falling snow appears the streaky green.
  Not so the Flower, which lasts for little space,
  A short-lived good, and an uncertain grace;
  This way, and that, the feeble stem is driven,
  Weak to sustain the storms and injuries of heaven.  

RHYME a a a

  Propp'd by the spring, it lifts aloft the head,
  But of a sickly beauty, soon to shed;
  In summer living, and in winter dead.

RHYME a a *

  For things of tender kind, for pleasure made,
  Shoot up with swift increase, and sudden are decay'd.

RHYME a a *

    With humble words, the wisest I could frame,
  And proffer'd service, I repaid the dame;
  That, of her grace, she gave her maid to know
  The secret meaning of this moral show.
  And she, to prove what profit I had made            
  Of mystic truth, in fables first convey'd,
  Demanded, till the next returning May,
  Whether the Leaf or Flower I would obey?
  I chose the Leaf; she smiled with sober cheer,
  And wish'd me fair adventure for the year,
  And gave me charms and sigils, for defence
  Against ill tongues that scandal innocence:
  But I, said she, my fellows must pursue,
  Already past the plain, and out of view.

RHYME a a a b b 

    We parted thus; I homeward sped my way,           
  Bewilder'd in the wood till dawn of day;
  And met the merry crew who danced about the May.
  Then late refresh'd with sleep, I rose to write
  The visionary vigils of the night.

RHYME a a b b 

    Blush, as thou may'st, my little book, with shame,
  Nor hope with homely verse to purchase fame;
  For such thy maker chose; and so design'd
  Thy simple style to suit thy lowly kind.

TITLE

RHYME a a *

  In days of old, when Arthur fill'd the throne,
  Whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown;
  The king of elves and little fairy queen
  Gamboll'd on heaths, and danced on every green;
  And where the jolly troop had led the round,
  The grass unbidden rose, and mark'd the ground:

RHYME a a a

  Nor darkling did they dance, the silver light
  Of Phoebe served to guide their steps aright,
  And with their tripping pleased, prolong the night.

RHYME a a a

  Her beams they follow'd, where at full she play'd,        
  Nor longer than she shed her horns they stay'd;
  From thence with airy flight to foreign lands convey'd

RHYME a a a

  Above the rest our Britain held they dear,
  More solemnly they kept their sabbaths here,
  And made more spacious rings, and revell'd half the year.

RHYME a a a

    I speak of ancient times, for now the swain
  Returning late may pass the woods in vain,
  And never hope to see the nightly train:

RHYME a a a

  In vain the dairy now with mints is dress'd,
  The dairymaid expects no fairy guest,                     
  To skim the bowls, and after pay the feast.

RHYME a a *

  She sighs and shakes her empty shoes in vain,
  No silver penny to reward her pain:
  For priests, with prayers, and other godly gear,
  Have made the merry goblins disappear;
  And where they play'd their merry pranks before,
  Have sprinkled holy water on the floor:

RHYME a a *

  And friars, that through the wealthy regions run,
  Thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun,
  Resort to farmers rich, and bless their halls,            
  And exorcise the beds, and cross the walls:
  This makes the fairy quires forsake the place,
  When once 'tis hallow'd with the rites of grace:

RHYME a a a

  But in the walks where wicked elves have been,
  The learning of the parish now is seen,
  The midnight parson, posting o'er the green,

RHYME a a a

  With gown tuck'd up, to wakes, for Sunday next,
  With humming ale encouraging his text;
  Nor wants the holy leer to country girl betwixt.

RHYME a a *

  From fiends and imps he sets the village free,            
  There haunts not any incubus but he.
  The maids and women need no danger fear
  To walk by night, and sanctity so near:
  For by some haycock, or some shady thorn,
  He bids his beads both even-song and morn.

RHYME a a a

    It so befell, in this King Arthur's reign,
  A lusty knight was pricking o'er the plain;
  A bachelor he was, and of the courtly train.

RHYME a a *

  It happen'd, as he rode, a damsel gay,
  In russet robes, to market took her way.                  
  Soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye,
  So straight she walk'd, and on her pasterns high:
  If, seeing her behind, he liked her pace,
  Now turning short, he better likes her face.
  He lights in haste, and, full of youthful fire,
  By force accomplish'd his obscene desire:
  This done, away he rode, not unespied,
  For swarming at his back the country cried:
  And once in view they never lost the sight,
  But seized, and pinion'd brought to court the knight,     

RHYME a a *

    Then courts of kings were held in high renown,
  Ere made the common brothels of the town:
  There, virgins honourable vows received,
  But chaste as maids in monasteries lived:
  The king himself, to nuptial ties a slave,
  No bad example to his poets gave:
  And they, not bad, but in a vicious age,
  Had not, to please the prince, debauch'd the stage.

RHYME a a *

    Now, what should Arthur do? He loved the knight,
  But sovereign monarchs are the source of right:           
  Moved by the damsel's tears and common cry,
  He doom'd the brutal ravisher to die.
  But fair Geneura rose in his defence,
  And pray'd so hard for mercy from the prince,
  That to his queen the king the offender gave,
  And left it in her power to kill or save:
  This gracious act the ladies all approve,
  Who thought it much a man should die for love;

RHYME a a a

  And with their mistress join'd in close debate,
  (Covering their kindness with dissembled hate)            
  If not to free him, to prolong his fate.

RHYME a a *

  At last agreed, they call him by consent
  Before the queen and female parliament;
  And the fair speaker, rising from the chair,
  Did thus the judgment of the house declare:

RHYME a a *

    Sir knight, though I have ask'd thy life, yet still
  Thy destiny depends upon my will:
  Nor hast thou other surety than the grace
  Not due to thee from our offended race.
  But as our kind is of a softer mould,                     
  And cannot blood without a sigh behold,
  I grant thee life; reserving still the power
  To take the forfeit when I see my hour:
  Unless thy answer to my next demand
  Shall set thee free from our avenging hand.

RHYME a a *

  The question, whose solution I require,
  Is, What the sex of women most desire?
  In this dispute thy judges are at strife;
  Beware; for on thy wit depends thy life.
  Yet (lest surprised, unknowing what to say,         
  Thou damn thyself) we give thee farther day:
  A year is thine to wander at thy will,
  And learn from others, if thou want'st the skill.
  But, not to hold our proffer turn'd to scorn,
  Good sureties will we have for thy return;
  That at the time prefix'd thou shalt obey,
  And at thy pledge's peril keep thy day.

RHYME a a *

    Woe was the knight at this severe command;
  But well he knew 'twas bootless to withstand:
  The terms accepted, as the fair ordain,             
  He put in bail for his return again,
  And promised answer at the day assign'd,
  The best, with Heaven's assistance, he could find.

RHYME a a a

    His leave thus taken, on his way he went
  With heavy heart, and full of discontent,
  Misdoubting much, and fearful of the event.

RHYME a a *

  'Twas hard the truth of such a point to find,
  As was not yet agreed among the kind.
  Thus on he went; still anxious more and more,
  Ask'd all he met, and knock'd at every door;        
  Inquired of men; but made his chief request,
  To learn from women what they loved the best.
  They answer'd each according to her mind,
  To please herself, not all the female kind.
  One was for wealth, another was for place;
  Crones, old and ugly, wish'd a better face:

RHYME a a *

  The widow's wish was oftentimes to wed;
  The wanton maids were all for sport a-bed.
  Some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies,
  And some gross flattery loved without disguise:     
  Truth is, says one, he seldom fails to win
  Who flatters well; for that's our darling sin:
  But long attendance, and a duteous mind,
  Will work even with the wisest of the kind.

RHYME a a *

  One thought the sex's prime felicity
  Was from the bonds of wedlock to be free;
  Their pleasures, hours, and actions all their own,
  And uncontroll'd to give account to none.
  Some wish a husband-fool; but such are cursed,
  For fools perverse of husbands are the worst:       
  All women would be counted chaste and wise,
  Nor should our spouses see, but with our eyes;
  For fools will prate; and though they want the wit
  To find close faults, yet open blots will hit;

RHYME a a *

  Though better for their ease to hold their tongue,
  For womankind was never in the wrong.
  So noise ensues, and quarrels last for life;
  The wife abhors the fool, the fool the wife.
  And some men say that great delight have we,
  To be for truth extoll'd, and secrecy;              
  And constant in one purpose still to dwell;
  And not our husbands' counsels to reveal.
  But that's a fable; for our sex is frail,
  Inventing rather than not tell a tale.
  Like leaky sieves, no secrets we can hold:
  Witness the famous tale that Ovid told.

RHYME a a *

    Midas the king, as in his book appears,
  By Phoebus was endow'd with ass's ears,
  Which under his long locks he well conceal'd,
  (As monarchs' vices must not be reveal'd)           
  For fear the people have them in the wind,
  Who long ago were neither dumb nor blind:
  Nor apt to think from Heaven their title springs,
  Since Jove and Mars left off begetting kings.
  This Midas knew; and durst communicate
  To none but to his wife his ears of state:
  One must be trusted, and he thought her fit,
  As passing prudent, and a parlous wit.
  To this sagacious confessor he went,
  And told her what a gift the gods had sent:         

RHYME a a *

  But told it under matrimonial seal,
  With strict injunction never to reveal.
  The secret heard, she plighted him her troth,
  (And sacred sure is every woman's oath)
  The royal malady should rest unknown,
  Both for her husband's honour and her own;
  But ne'ertheless she pined with discontent;
  The counsel rumbled till it found a vent.

RHYME a a a

  The thing she knew she was obliged to hide;
  By interest and by oath the wife was tied;          
  But if she told it not, the woman died.

RHYME a a a

  Loath to betray a husband and a prince,
  But she must burst, or blab; and no pretence
  Of honour tied her tongue from self-defence.

RHYME a a *

  A marshy ground commodiously was near,
  Thither she ran, and held her breath for fear;
  Lest if a word she spoke of any thing,
  That word might be the secret of the king.
  Thus full of counsel to the fen she went,
  Griped all the way, and longing for a vent;         

RHYME a a *

  Arrived, by pure necessity compell'd,
  On her majestic marrow-bones she kneel'd:
  Then to the water's brink she laid her head,
  And as a bittour[g i ] bumps within a reed,
  To thee alone, O lake, she said, I tell,
  (And, as thy queen, command thee to conceal!)
  Beneath his locks the king, my husband wears
  A goodly royal pair of ass's ears:
  Now I have eased my bosom of the pain,
  Till the next longing fit return again.             

RHYME a a *

    Thus through a woman was the secret known;
  Tell us, and in effect you tell the town.
  But to my tale; the knight with heavy cheer,
  Wandering in vain, had now consumed the year:
  One day was only left to solve the doubt,
  Yet knew no more than when he first set out.
  But home he must, and as the award had been,
  Yield up his body captive to the queen.
  In this despairing state he happ'd to ride,
  As fortune led him, by a forest side:               
  Lonely the vale, and full of horror stood,
  Brown with the shade of a religious wood!
  When full before him, at the noon of night,
  (The moon was up, and shot a gleamy light)

RHYME a a *

  He saw a quire of ladies in a round
  That featly footing seem'd to skim the ground:
  Thus dancing hand in hand, so light they were,
  He knew not where they trod, on earth or air.

RHYME a a a

  At speed he drove, and came a sudden guest,
  In hope where many women were, at least             
  Some one by chance might answer his request.

RHYME a a *

  But faster than his horse the ladies flew,
  And in a trice were vanish'd out of view.
    One only hag remain'd; but fouler far
  Than grandame apes in Indian forests are:

RHYME a a a

  Against a wither'd oak she lean'd her weight,
  Propp'd on her trusty staff, not half upright,
  And dropp'd an awkward courtesy to the knight;

RHYME a a *

  Then said, What makes you, sir, so late abroad
  Without a guide, and this no beaten road?           
  Or want you aught that here you hope to find,
  Or travel for some trouble in your mind?
  The last I guess; and if I read aright,
  Those of our sex are bound to serve a knight;
  Perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage,
  Then tell your pain; for wisdom is in age.

RHYME a a *

    To this the knight: Good mother, would you know
  The secret cause and spring of all my woe?
  My life must with to-morrow's light expire,
  Unless I tell what women most desire.               
  Now could you help me at this hard essay,
  Or for your inborn goodness, or for pay;
  Yours is my life, redeem'd by your advice,
  Ask what you please, and I will pay the price;
  The proudest kerchief of the court shall rest
  Well satisfied of what they love the best.
  Plight me thy faith, quoth she, that what I ask,
  Thy danger over, and perform'd thy task,
  That thou shalt give for hire of thy demand;
  Here take thy oath, and seal it on my hand;         
  I warrant thee, on peril of my life,
  Thy words shall please both widow, maid, and wife.

RHYME a a *

    More words there needed not to move the knight
  To take her offer, and his truth to plight.
  With that she spread a mantle on the ground,
  And, first inquiring whither he was bound,
  Bade him not fear, though long and rough the way,
  At court he should arrive ere break of day;

RHYME a a a

  His horse should find the way without a guide.
  She said: with fury they began to ride,             
  He on the midst, the beldam at his side.

RHYME a a *

  The horse what devil drove I cannot tell,
  But only this, they sped their journey well:
  And all the way the crone inform'd the knight,
  How he should answer the demand aright.

RHYME a a *

    To court they came; the news was quickly spread
  Of his returning to redeem his head.
  The female senate was assembled soon,
  With all the mob of women in the town:
  The queen sat lord chief-justice of the hall,       
  And bade the crier cite the criminal.
  The knight appear'd; and silence they proclaim;
  Then first the culprit answer'd to his name:
  And, after forms of law, was last required
  To name the thing that women most desired.

RHYME a a *

    The offender, taught his lesson by the way,
  And by his counsel order'd what to say,
  Thus bold began: My lady liege, said he,
  What all your sex desire is Sovereignty.
  The wife affects her husband to command;            
  All must be hers, both money, house, and land.
  The maids are mistresses even in their name;
  And of their servants full dominion claim.

RHYME a a a

  This, at the peril of my head, I say,
  A blunt plain truth, the sex aspires to sway,
  You to rule all, while we, like slaves, obey.

RHYME a a *

  There was not one, or widow, maid, or wife,
  But said the knight had well deserved his life.
  Even fair Geneura, with a blush, confess'd
  The man had found what women love the best.

RHYME a a *

    Upstarts the beldam, who was there unseen,        
  And, reverence made, accosted thus the queen:
  My liege, said she, before the court arise,
  May I, poor wretch, find favour in your eyes,
  To grant my just request? 'twas I who taught
  The knight this answer, and inspired his thought;
  None but a woman could a man direct
  To tell us women what we most affect.
  But first I swore him on his knightly troth,
  (And here demand performance of his oath)           

RHYME a a *

  To grant the boon that next I should desire;
  He gave his faith, and I expect my hire:
  My promise is fulfill'd; I saved his life,
  And claim his debt, to take me for his wife.
  The knight was ask'd, nor could his oath deny,
  But hoped they would not force him to comply.
  The women, who would rather wrest the laws,
  Than let a sister-plaintiff lose the cause,
  (As judges on the bench more gracious are,
  And more attent to brothers of the bar)             
  Cried one and all, the suppliant should have right,
  And to the grandame hag adjudged the knight.

RHYME a a *

    In vain he sigh'd, and oft with tears desired
  Some reasonable suit might be required.
  But still the crone was constant to her note;
  The more he spoke, the more she stretch'd her throat.
  In vain he proffer'd all his goods, to save
  His body destined to that living grave.
  The liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn;
  And nothing but the man would serve her turn.       
  Not all the wealth of eastern kings, said she,
  Have power to part my plighted love, and me;
  And, old and ugly as I am, and poor,
  Yet never will I break the faith I swore;
  For mine thou art by promise, during life,
  And I thy loving and obedient wife.

RHYME a a *

    My love! nay, rather, my damnation thou,
  Said he: nor am I bound to keep my vow:
  The fiend thy sire hath sent thee from below,
  Else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know?       

RHYME a a a

  Avaunt, old witch! for I renounce thy bed:
  The queen may take the forfeit of my head,
  Ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed.

RHYME a a *

  Both heard, the judge pronounced against the knight;
  So was he married in his own despite;

RHYME a a *

  And all day after hid him as an owl,
  Not able to sustain a sight so foul.
  Perhaps the reader thinks I do him wrong,
  To pass the marriage feast, and nuptial song:
  Mirth there was none, the man was _a-la-mort_,      
  And little courage had to make his court.
  To bed they went, the bridegroom and the bride:
  Was never such an ill-pair'd couple tied,

RHYME a a *

  Restless, he toss'd and tumbled to and fro,
  And roll'd, and wriggled further off, for woe.
  The good old wife lay smiling by his side,
  And caught him in her quivering arms, and cried,

RHYME a a a

  When you my ravish'd predecessor saw,
  You were not then become this man of straw;
  Had you been such, you might have 'scaped the law.  

RHYME a a *

  Is this the custom of King Arthur's court?
  Are all round-table knights of such a sort?
  Remember, I am she who saved your life,
  Your loving, lawful, and complying wife:
  Not thus you swore in your unhappy hour,
  Nor I for this return employ'd my power.
  In time of need I was your faithful friend;
  Nor did I since, nor ever will offend.
  Believe me, my loved lord, 'tis much unkind;
  What fury has possess'd your alter'd mind?          

RHYME a a *

  Thus on my wedding night--without pretence--
  Come turn this way, or tell me my offence.
  If not your wife, let reason's rule persuade;
  Name but my fault, amends shall soon be made.
  Amends! nay, that's impossible, said he,
  What change of age or ugliness can be?

RHYME a a a

  Or could Medea's magic mend thy face,
  Thou art descended from so mean a race,
  That never knight was match'd with such disgrace.

RHYME a a *

  What wonder, madam, if I move my side,              
  When, if I turn, I turn to such a bride?
  And is this all that troubles you so sore?
  And what the devil couldst thou wish me more?
  Ah, Benedicite, replied the crone;
  Then cause of just complaining have you none.
  The remedy to this were soon applied,
  Would you be like the bridegroom to the bride:
  But, for you say a long descended race,
  And wealth and dignity, and power and place,

RHYME a a *

  Make gentlemen, and that your high degree           
  Is much disparaged to be match'd with me;
  Know this, my lord, nobility of blood
  Is but a glittering and fallacious good:
  The nobleman is he, whose noble mind
  Is fill'd with inborn worth, unborrow'd from his kind.
  The King of Heaven was in a manger laid,
  And took his earth but from an humble maid;
  Then what can birth, or mortal men, bestow?
  Since floods no higher than their fountains flow.
  We, who for name and empty honour strive,           
  Our true nobility from him derive.
  Your ancestors, who puff your mind with pride,
  And vast estates to mighty titles tied,
  Did not your honour, but their own, advance;
  For virtue comes not by inheritance.

RHYME a a *

  If you tralineate from your father's mind,
  What are you else but of a bastard kind?
  Do, as your great progenitors have done,
  And, by their virtues, prove yourself their son.
  No father can infuse or wit or grace;               
  A mother comes across, and mars the race.
  A grandsire or a grandame taints the blood;
  And seldom three descents continue good.
  Were virtue by descent, a noble name
  Could never villanise his father's fame;
  But, as the first, the last of all the line,
  Would, like the sun, even in descending shine;
  Take fire, and bear it to the darkest house,
  Betwixt King Arthur's court and Caucasus:

RHYME a a *

  If you depart, the flame shall still remain,        
  And the bright blaze enlighten all the plain:
  Nor, till the fuel perish, can decay,
  By nature form'd on things combustible to prey.
  Such is not man, who, mixing better seed
  With worse, begets a base degenerate breed:
  The bad corrupts the good, and leaves behind
  No trace of all the great begetter's mind.
  The father sinks within his son, we see,
  And often rises in the third degree;
  If better luck a better mother give,                
  Chance gave us being, and by chance we live.

RHYME a a a

  Such as our atoms were, even such are we,
  Or call it chance, or strong necessity:
  Thus loaded with dead weight, the will is free.

RHYME a a *

  And thus it needs must be; for seed conjoin'd
  Lets into nature's work the imperfect kind;
  But fire, the enlivener of the general frame,
  Is one, its operation still the same.

RHYME a a *

  Its principle is in itself: while ours
  Works, as confederates war, with mingled powers;    
  Or man or woman, which soever fails:
  And oft the vigour of the worse prevails.
  Aether with sulphur blended alters hue,
  And casts a dusky gleam of Sodom blue.
  Thus, in a brute, their ancient honour ends,
  And the fair mermaid in a fish descends:
  The line is gone; no longer duke or earl;
  But, by himself degraded, turns a churl.

RHYME a a a

  Nobility of blood is but renown
  Of thy great fathers by their virtue known,         
  And a long trail of light, to thee descending down.

RHYME a a *

  If in thy smoke it ends, their glories shine;
  But infamy and villanage are thine.
  Then what I said before is plainly show'd,
  The true nobility proceeds from God;
  Nor left us by inheritance, but given
  By bounty of our stars, and grace of Heaven.
  Thus from a captive Servius Tullius rose,
  Whom for his virtues the first Romans chose:

RHYME a a *

  Fabricius from their walls repell'd the foe,        
  Whose noble hands had exercised the plough.
  From hence, my lord, and love, I thus conclude,
  That though my homely ancestors were rude,
  Mean as I am, yet I may have the grace
  To make you father of a generous race:
  And noble then am I, when I begin,
  In virtue clothed, to cast the rags of sin.
  If poverty be my upbraided crime,
  And you believe in Heaven, there was a time

RHYME a a *

  When He, the great controller of our fate,          
  Deign'd to be man, and lived in low estate;
  Which He who had the world at his dispose,
  If poverty were vice, would never choose.
  Philosophers have said, and poets sing,
  That a glad poverty's an honest thing.
  Content is wealth, the riches of the mind;
  And happy he who can that treasure find.

RHYME a a a

  But the base miser starves amidst his store,
  Broods on his gold, and, griping still at more,
  Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor.          

RHYME a a *

  The ragged beggar, though he want relief,
  Has not to lose, and sings before the thief.
  Want is a bitter and a hateful good,
  Because its virtues are not understood;
  Yet many things, impossible to thought,
  Have been by need to full perfection brought:
  The daring of the soul proceeds from thence,
  Sharpness of wit, and active diligence:
  Prudence at once, and fortitude, it gives,
  And, if in patience taken, mends our lives;         
  For even that indigence, that brings me low,
  Makes me myself, and Him above, to know.

RHYME a a *

  A good which none would challenge, few would choose,
  A fair possession, which mankind refuse.
  If we from wealth to poverty descend,
  Want gives to know the flatterer from the friend.
  If I am old and ugly, well for you,
  No lewd adulterer will my love pursue;

RHYME a a *

  Nor jealousy, the bane of married life,
  Shall haunt you for a wither'd homely wife;         
  For age and ugliness, as all agree,
  Are the best guards of female chastity.
  Yet since I see your mind is worldly bent,
  I'll do my best to further your content.
  And therefore of two gifts in my dispose,
  Think ere you speak, I grant you leave to choose:
  Would you I should be still deform'd and old,
  Nauseous to touch, and loathsome to behold;

RHYME a a *

  On this condition to remain for life,
  A careful, tender, and obedient wife,               
  In all I can contribute to your ease,
  And not in deed, or word, or thought displease:
  Or would you rather have me young and fair,
  And take the chance that happens to your share?
  Temptations are in beauty, and in youth,
  And how can you depend upon my truth?
  Now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss,
  And thank yourself, if aught should fall amiss.

RHYME a a *

    Sore sigh'd the knight, who this long sermon heard;
  At length, considering all, his heart he cheer'd,   
  And thus replied: My lady, and my wife,
  To your wise conduct I resign my life:
  Choose you for me, for well you understand
  The future good and ill, on either hand:
  But if an humble husband may request,
  Provide, and order all things for the best;
  Yours be the care to profit, and to please;
  And let your subject servant take his ease.

RHYME a a *

    Then thus in peace, quoth she, concludes the strife,
  Since I am turn'd the husband, you the wife:        
  The matrimonial victory is mine,
  Which, having fairly gain'd, I will resign:
  Forgive if I have said or done amiss,
  And seal the bargain with a friendly kiss.
  I promised you but one content to share,
  But now I will become both good and fair:
  No nuptial quarrel shall disturb your ease;
  The business of my life shall be to please:
  And for my beauty, that, as time shall try--
  But draw the curtain first, and cast your eye.      

RHYME a a *

    He look'd, and saw a creature heavenly fair,
  In bloom of youth, and of a charming air.
  With joy he turn'd, and seized her ivory arm;
  And like Pygmalion found the statue warm.
  Small arguments there needed to prevail;
  A storm of kisses pour'd as thick as hail.
  Thus long in mutual bliss they lay embraced,
  And their first love continued to the last:
  One sunshine was their life, no cloud between;
  Nor ever was a kinder couple seen.                  

RHYME a a *

    And so may all our lives like theirs be led;
  Heaven send the maids young husbands fresh in bed!
  May widows wed as often as they can,
  And ever for the better change their man!
  And some devouring plague pursue their lives,
  Who will not well be govern'd by their wives!

TITLE

RHYME a a *

  A parish priest was of the pilgrim train;
  An awful, reverend, and religious man.
  His eyes diffused a venerable grace,
  And charity itself was in his face.

RHYME a a a

  Rich was his soul, though his attire was poor;
  (As God had clothed his own ambassador;)
  For such, on earth, his bless'd Redeemer bore.

RHYME a a *

  Of sixty years he seem'd; and well might last
  To sixty more, but that he lived too fast;

RHYME a a *

  Refined himself to soul, to curb the sense;               
  And made almost a sin of abstinence,
  Yet, had his aspect nothing of severe,
  But such a face as promised him sincere.

RHYME a a a

  Nothing reserved or sullen was to see;
  But sweet regards, and pleasing sanctity:
  Mild was his accent, and his action free.

RHYME a a *

  With eloquence innate his tongue was arm'd;
  Though harsh the precept, yet the preacher charm'd.
  For letting down the golden chain from high,
  He drew his audience upward to the sky;                   

RHYME a a *

  And oft, with holy hymns, he charm'd their ears:
  (A music more melodious than the spheres.)
  For David left him, when he went to rest,
  His lyre; and after him he sung the best.
  He bore his great commission in his look:
  But sweetly temper'd awe; and soften'd all he spoke.

RHYME a a a

  He preach'd the joys of heaven, and pains of hell;
  And warn'd the sinner with becoming zeal;
  But on eternal mercy loved to dwell.

RHYME a a *

  He taught the gospel rather than the law,                 
  And forced himself to drive: but loved to draw.

RHYME a a *

  For fear but freezes minds; but love, like heat,
  Exhales the soul sublime, to seek her native seat.
  To threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard,
  Wrapp'd in his crimes, against the storm prepared;
  But, when the milder beams of mercy play,
  He melts, and throws his cumbrous cloak away,
  Lightning and thunder (heaven's artillery)
  As harbingers before the Almighty fly:
  Those but proclaim his style, and disappear;              
  The stiller sound succeeds, and God is there.

RHYME a a *

    The tithes, his parish freely paid, he took;
  But never sued, or cursed with bell and book.
  With patience bearing wrong; but offering none:
  Since every man is free to lose his own.
  The country churls, according to their kind,
  (Who grudge their dues, and love to be behind),
  The less he sought his offerings, pinch'd the more,
  And praised a priest contented to be poor.

RHYME a a *

    Yet of his little he had some to spare,                 
  To feed the famish'd, and to clothe the bare;
  For mortified he was to that degree,
  A poorer than himself he would not see.
  True priests, he said, and preachers of the Word,
  Were only stewards of their sovereign Lord:
  Nothing was theirs; but all the public store;
  Intrusted riches, to relieve the poor:
  Who, should they steal for want of his relief,
  He judged himself accomplice with the thief.

RHYME a a *

    Wide was his parish; not contracted close               
  In streets, but here and there a straggling house;
  Yet still he was at hand, without request,
  To serve the sick; to succour the distress'd:
  Tempting, on foot, alone, without affright,
  The dangers of a dark tempestuous night.

RHYME a a *

    All this the good old man perform'd alone,
  Nor spared his pains; for curate he had none:
  Nor durst he trust another with his care;
  Nor rode himself to Paul's, the public fair,
  To chaffer for preferment with his gold,                  
  Where bishoprics and sinecures are sold:

RHYME a a a

  But duly watch'd his flock, by night and day,
  And from the prowling wolf redeem'd the prey;
  And hungry sent the wily fox away.

RHYME a a *

    The proud he tamed, the penitent he cheer'd;
  Nor to rebuke the rich offender fear'd.
  His preaching much, but more his practice wrought;
  (A living sermon of the truths he taught);
  For this by rules severe his life he squared,
  That all might see the doctrine which they heard.         
  For priests, he said, are patterns for the rest:
  (The gold of heaven, who bear the God impress'd):
  But when the precious coin is kept unclean,
  The Sovereign's image is no longer seen.
  If they be foul on whom the people trust,
  Well may the baser brass contract a rust.

RHYME a a *

    The prelate for his holy life he prized;
  The worldly pomp of prelacy despised:
  His Saviour came not with a gaudy show;
  Nor was his kingdom of the world below.                   

RHYME a a a

  Patience in want, and poverty of mind,
  These marks of Church and Churchmen he design'd,
  And living taught, and dying left behind.

RHYME a a *

  The crown he wore was of the pointed thorn:
  In purple he was crucified, not born.
  They who contend for place and high degree,
  Are not his sons, but those of Zebedee.

RHYME a a *

    Not but he knew the signs of earthly power
  Might well become Saint Peter's successor;
  The holy father holds a double reign,               
  The prince may keep his pomp, the fisher must be plain.

RHYME a a *

    Such was the saint, who shone with every grace,
  Reflecting, Moses'-like, his Maker's face.
  God saw his image lively was express'd;
  And his own work, as in creation, bless'd.

RHYME a a *

    The Tempter saw him too, with envious eye;
  And, as on Job, demanded leave to try.
  He took the time when Richard was deposed,
  And high and low with happy Harry closed.
  This prince, though great in arms, the priest withstood:
  Near though he was, yet not the next of blood.

RHYME a a a

  Had Richard, unconstrain'd, resign'd the throne,
  A king can give no more than is his own:
  The title stood entail'd, had Richard had a son.

RHYME a a *

    Conquest, an odious name, was laid aside,
  Where all submitted, none the battle tried.
  The senseless plea of right by Providence
  Was, by a flattering priest, invented since;
  And lasts no longer than the present sway;
  But justifies the next who comes in play.           

RHYME a a *

    The people's right remains; let those who dare
  Dispute their power, when they the judges are.

RHYME a a *

    He join'd not in their choice, because he knew
  Worse might, and often did, from change ensue.
  Much to himself he thought; but little spoke;
  And, undeprived, his benefice forsook.

RHYME a a *

    Now, through the land, his cure of souls he stretch'd;
  And like a primitive apostle preach'd:
  Still cheerful; ever constant to his call;
  By many follow'd; loved by most, admired by all.    
  With what he begg'd, his brethren he relieved:
  And gave the charities himself received.
  Gave, while he taught; and edified the more,
  Because he showed, by proof, 'twas easy to be poor.

RHYME a a *

    He went not with the crowd to see a shrine;
  But fed us, by the way, with food divine.

RHYME a a *

    In deference to his virtues, I forbear
  To show you what the rest in orders were:
  This brilliant is so spotless and so bright,
  He needs no foil, but shines by his own proper light.

TITLE The Free-Thinkers

RHYME a a *

Jack: FRiend! if I'm late, excuse the failing,
And think, that Reasons much prevailing,
Have kept me, for an house, or better
(Since I receive'd your tempting Letter)
From this dear Scene, of Joy, and Drinking,
And ev'ry Licence of Free-thinking.
But, tell me, who's this rustick Fellow
That looks as Spleenatick and yellow,
As if his Rev'rend Parson aw'd him,
And with Ten Precepts weekly claw'd him?
Is he! of Parts, or Person, proper
With Men like us! to share a Supper,
To hear all Beings, prov'd Mechanick,
And Nature, resu'd from the Panic?

RHYME a a *

Tom: Be easy, Jack, and you, this Bumpkin
Shall quickly find, is good for something,
Who may be moulded to our wishes,
By Wine, and Wit, and sav'ry Dishes;
And, if he's Plyant, as his Name is,
Well worth the case, you'll find the Game is.
In Youth, Pedantick Tutors, bred him,
And with half Notions, crudely fed him,
The Town, as he'll inform you, fully,
Next, turn'd him to a Take, and Bully;
The Country, since, has been his Station,
Where he's a Patriot out of Fashion;
Stickles for Monarchy, and Orders,
With all, that on Religion borders,
On which, so shrewdly he Discourses,
He Mawls sometimes, our new rais'd Forces;

RHYME a a a b b c c 

But we're uncivil -- here's your Health Sir,
'Tis hop'd you'll pardon, we Free-thinkers
Are unconfin'd, and Lawless Drinkers,
And whatsoever suits, or pleases,
Or for our Profit, or our Ease is,
We never baulk it, or ill breeding,
Is now esteem'd, this Frank proceeding.

RHYME a a *

Plyant. I thank you, Sir, for this Instruction,
Which did not need an Introduction,
For all, that I shall see you practice
I will conclude, still, most exact is;
I, formerly, with Wits, and Roarers,
With Bully-Rocks, and bilking Scorers,
Was us'd to Herd, and call'd a Ranter,
And in the Pit, could Vizars banter,
But since, reflecting on that Folly,
I can no more be loud, and jolly;
But fort he time to come, shall spend it
Like one, that knows he soon must end it;
Yet, real Wit, that's Chast, and Sober,
Heighten'd a little with October,
Whether express'd, in Words, or Writing,
Will to my Death-Bed be delighting.

RHYME a a *

Tom. Champaigne, will surely raise it faster,
Believe me, who have been your Taster,
A Flask of this, for your half Guinea,
Will stir up all, that's bright within ye,
Support you, when enclin'd to Sinking,
And teach your Pleasure! and Free-Thinking?

RHYME a a *

Ply. Why Sir, my thoughts were never bounded,
But still, have all the Globe surrounded,
Recall'd the past, and reach'd the future,
Unhelp'd by such a costly Tutor;
But this Free-Thinking, pray what is it?
If Wit, methinks I would not miss it,

RHYME a a *

Or see again, my Native Mansion,
Unlearn'd, in any new Invention;
And sure, a Cant, will bear rehearsal,
Which is become so universal,
That even the Drawer, (to my admiring)
Answer'd me, when you for you inquiring,
You wou'd be here, I need not doubt you,
Free-Thinkers, cou'd not live without you,
That Table's his, quote he, depend on't,
He always sits at th'upper end on't,
And talks such wonders, to the Youngsters,
They know not if they're Men, or Monsters,
But yet, of this, (so clear 'tis stated)
They're sure, they never were Created,

RHYME a a *

But first sprung up, they know not where,
Now when, nor how. 'Twill make you stare
To hear him, (whilst they do adore him)
Make Fools of all, that went before him.

RHYME a a *

A Dam'sel next, both Young and Pretty,
Cry'd, welcome Land-Lord to this City;
And clapp'd me roundly on the Shoulder,
No Army Trull, was ever bolder;
And, when I ask'd her, who had taught her
Such Impudence, and hither brought her,
She answer'd (mincing in her manners)
Free-Thinkers, Sir! I thank their Honours;
Which makes me find, you've condescended
By every Rank, to be attended,
And your new Doctrine (Grave, or Frolick,)
Has spread, as if 'twere Apostolick.

RHYME a a *

Tom. We have indeed, the World enlighten'd
And Boys, and Girls, are not so frighten'd
With God, and Evi, (taught at random
In Nurseries by Palsied Gran-am)
As heretofore, were Men, and Matrons;
Free-thinking, Sir, has mighty Patrons.

RHYME a a *

Ply. But may an honest Man relie on't?
Tom. Jack, Here's a Health to Lady Plyant;
Methinks, she seldom comes to Town, Sir.
Ply. Why, 'tis so hard, to get her down, Sir
But, this Free-thinking, pray explain it?
For, if a Man should over strain it,
What sees at first, but Whim, and Notion,
May, Clash with Honour, and Devotion;
With Magna Charta, or Superiors,
And make us think, there's no Inferiors,
But all were born upon the Level,
And equally should sway, and Revel.

RHYME a a *

Jack. Intolerable! Can you like him?
Tom. He'll soon be Drunk, and then we'll strike him,
Unfold our latitude Opinions,
And add him, to our large Dominions.

RHYME a a *

Tom. Your Son, your Second,
He a Free-Thinker has been reckon'd,
A Man of wond'rou sense, and Mettal,
Fit to unhinge, and then resettle,
To lose the Bands, whch Education
Imposes, on a free born Nation;
To show, how Life shou'd slide along,
Unheeding hwat's to come, or gone;
How self! we always shou'd consider,
And follow still the fairest Bidder.
Snatch in the nick the Good that's certain,
Nor mind, what's hid behind the Curtain.

RHYME a a *

Ply. Why, if you mean young Richard Plyant,
He shall scale Heaven with any Gyant,
Who of Lycurgus talks, and Solon,
And is old Dog, at Dobbs and Toland;
Knows all Republican Defences,
And Raves on Cato Uticensis,
With t'other of that Name, and Brutus
He daily labours to confute us;
When Adam dug, and Eve set Onions,
He says, that all Men were Companions;
That Kings were made but for the People,
As for the Church was made the Steeple;
Which, tho' it highest stands, and fair is,
To make them meet, its only Care is;
And, whilst that Noise, and Pomp possesses
The People 'tis, must lay the Cesses;
That 'tis, but as the People bawl,
Unto whose share, the Ropes should fall;
And when it sinks, by Age, or Weather,
The People, must erect another.

RHYME a a *

Tom. Perfect Allusion! strong, and valid;
I ne'er heard Argument so solid,
Why here's a Lad, all Flame and Spirit,
Sir Disinherit! Disinherit!
Leave not the Eldest born, an Acre,
But raise this generous Undertaker;
In London let him still be gallant,
And much with us, to mend his Talent;
Encourag'd by our daring Papers,
And growling, talk of Spleen, and Vapors,
With Equipage, and Gold enough,
And let him be interr'd in Snuff;
And Smyrna for his House be noted,
And he, for early News, be quoted,
Which, if contested, let a Wager
Profusely big, cofute th'Engager.

RHYME a a *

Ply. How Dick!. have all, have Giles offended?
Tom. No, but your Race will thus be mended;
Hereditary, is a Jest Sir,
Right's in the strongest, and the Best Sir,
Let Dick ascend, or if the Females,
Do in your Line, outvalue the Males,
There, give the Land, and great match'em.
Ply. No, e'er I do, Old Nick shall fetch'em.

RHYME a a *

Tho' Moll coul'd spend a mighty Fortune,
And for Supplies does still Importune;
Is grown a Writer and a Rattler,
And ev'ry Moment, quotes the Tattler;
To Opera's, she sweekly Flutters,
And mirlst [sic] her talking, Verses sputters;
And, when I bid her leave that Tone,
She sings, I'll live for you alone,
I tell her, that she goes too fine,
She sings, ***Oh! Nymph of Race Divine!
I chanc'd to read upon her Toe,
She singing, scream'd out, Cupid Oh!
Besides, the Charge each time she hears it,
Wou'd buy a Shift, her Mother swears it.

RHYME a a *

Jack. She's a Free-Thinker, I imagine,
And all that's witty does engage in,
But her last Fault you'll see amended,
For Opera's will soon be ended,
Since Ridicule, that's so subduing,
Has now contriv'd it's total Ruin;
And though, indeed, it bore the Proof
Of ****Bread and Butter round the Loaf;
And still kept ground, before our Plays,
Though hack'd and hew'd, by Poet +Bays,
A waggish Title now must blast it,
And Punch's Opera will cast it.

RHYME a a *

Ply. I am glad 'twill down, but why that Tool,
Is reason, less then Ridicule,

RHYME a a *

Jack. Oh Sir, by much! all Mortals fear it,
And neither Man, nor Brute can bear it,
When I've but then my Finger pointed,
And with screw'd Looks my Face dis-jointed,
My Dog, I have uneasy seen.
Tom. Jack, you forget, he's a Machine . . .

RHYME a a *

Jack. There is a *****Tract! I'll say no more,
But, had they Rally'd heretofore,
We had not been misled and fetter'd.
Some Days kept plain, and some red Letter'd,
But, in full Liberty, had trod still,
Ply. And Heathn Idols, been our Gods still;

RHYME a a *

Yet, when lewd Wit, Thersites wasted,
All that he got, was to be basted,
Nor, wou'd the Greeks, have lost Elysium,
Shou'd he have held it in Derision,
Tho' Brittons, woul'd it seems have given
For smart Buffooning, all their Heaven.

RHYME a a *

Jack. They had reign'd to Ridiculing;
Ply. And wittily been damn'd for fooling.

RHYME a a *

Jack.. Make that, the Subject of your Laughter,
There's nothing Sir to come hereafter.

RHYME a a *

Tom. Free-Thinking, rescues from that Error,
Which keeps you in this constant Terror.

RHYME a a *

Ply. Why them, what you, Free-thinking call,
I find, is not to Think at all;
And Savages, through want of breeding,
Are what you grow, by dint of reading.
My Carter saw my Father buried,
And as to Earth, his Corps was carried,
Farewel quoth he, my good old Master,
You, and your mare who dyed last Easter,
Shall now, no more, know joys, or flashes,
But be, for ever, Dust and Ashes.

RHYME a a *

Tom. Well said, brave Hobb! is such Free-thinking
Down, to the dull Plebean Sinking?,
And so the Clowns, talk at this rate too?
Ply. Then Fools, were Socrates, and Plato,
Though once esteem'd both, wise and great,
For tracing out, a Future State.

RHYME a a *

Jack. Wou'd you be still, then so confin'd,
Nor free in Body, nor in Mind?

RHYME a a *

Ply. Why Sir, were I all Air, or Fire,
What freedom more cou'd I desire?
Wo'd not with others Rights make bold,
And what's my own, is all Free-hold.

RHYME a a *

Tom. But, where's the Taste, in such posessing?
The Pleasure, sure, is in Transgressing,
In doing, what another dare not,
And showing, we, for Statutes care not;
Were I, but stronger than my Neighbours,
I'd reap the Fruit, of all their Labours,
A Fellow, that with-held his Wife
'Cause by the Priest, bestow'd for Life,
Should instantly be sack'd, and plunder'd,
And us'd the worst, in all the Hundred;
Had I a Naboth, on each side me,
Wh had a Field, or Grove, deny'd me,
In that, my Team, by force shou'd enter,
And this, shou'd warm my Hearth in Winter;
The Church, if to my House 'was joyn'd,
Shou'd with my Orange Trees, be lin'd,
The Parson, if she still wou'd keep it,
Should trim the Boughs, and dayly sweep it,
His Surplice, in true Blue being dy'd,
Shou'd Aprons for the Work provide.

Ply. But, for this vigorous Employment,
This self providing, this Enjoyment,
I can discern no proper Season;
Unless brought in, by War, and Treason,
And, I have still, been wond'rous loath,
To violate the Allegiance Oath.

RHYME a a *

Tom. Sir, I am much surpriz'd, at finding
You think a trivial Oath, so binding,
Swearing in Taverns, or the Temple,
Differ but only in th'Example;
One leads the Mob, to soar, and Hector,
T'other, to sneak to some Protector;
For Men of Sense, 'twas ne'er intended,
But, for the Countenance they lend it.

RHYME a a *

Ply. Yet, in my Thought, there one thing more is,
Are you, Free-Thinkers, Whiggs or Tories?

RHYME a a *

Jack. They steadily, indeed, are neither,
Occasionally, can be either;
Distinction, their large Aim, disgraces;
They're of no Party, but for Places;
Scorning all Ties, Divine or Civil.
Ply. Why this Free-Thinking is the Devil!
But yet I fear, that whilst I'm trying
With this new Scheme, to be complying,
I shall some Book, be turning over,
With Clasps, and Turky-Leather Cover,
Which I'll not name (aw'd by my Betters)
As 'tis Entitl'd in Gold Letters.

RHYME a a *

As far as Lombard Street's my Lodging,
Where I have plac'd Five Hundred Pounds,
The Product of my Pasture Ground,
And must make hast, so to dispose it,
That Bankrupts, may not sink, or lose it.

RHYME a a *

Tom. You're for the city, Sir too late,
They've long e're this, barr'd ev'ry Gate,
And are each Lane, and Passage guarding,
As safe, as if they fear'd Bombarding:
Let me, this Night, your Presence borrow?
Ply. The Money must be paid to morrow,
'Twixt Eight, and Nine, it is appointed.
Tom. You are not with their Ways acquainted,

RHYME a a *

They'll make you wait till Twelve, or one,
Before this Business can be done;
And, you're not well, yet, of your Journey,
Give me your Letter of Attorney,
I'll take the Drudgery of staying,
And when 'tis ready for conveying,
Dispatch my Man, to give you warning,
Who may til then, sleep out the Morning;
Come, own the Truth, did not my Lady
Cry, be as careful Dear, as may be,
And, with her kind, controwling Powers,
Engage you to observe good Hours?
Then, since to night, you have transgress'd,
You must to morrow, take your rest,

The summ is large, but we have earn'd it.
For he'll so fast his stock be raising,
Beyond the ways, of Plough and Grazing,
That he'll have Cause to bless the Minute,
And those, who did inform him in it;
Mean while, towards Holland I'll be jogging

Or being with that Toledo haunted,
Nay, prethee Thomas, be not daunted!

What if in this we went no further.

And the Attempt, without the Profit,
Wou'd wrong the Judgment of Free-thinkers.
Tom. Great Wits, from Dangers have been Shrinkers,
Therefore 'tis fix'd, I'll not pursue it,
Take you the Note, and boldly do it.
Who domineer, 'till shunn'd, and dreaded,
As if a Legion you had headed;

Then, sure you're Valiant at the bottom?
Jack. I'll share the Pounds, when you have got 'em.
But all Free-thinkers in the Nation,
Know our first Rule's Self-preservation,
For once our Life cut short below,
(Although we seem to brave it so)
You guess Friend Tom where next we go.

As Merc'ry travell'd thro' a Wood,
(Whose Errands are more Fleet than Good)
An Elephant before him lay,
That much encumber'd had the Way:
The Messenger, who's still in haste,
Wou'd fain have bow'd, and so have past;
When up arose th' unweildy Brute,
And wou'd repeat a late Dispute,

RHYME a a *

In which (he said) he'd gain'd the Prize
From a wild Boar of monstrous Size:
But Fame (quoth he) with all her Tongues,
Who Lawyers, Ladies, Soldiers wrongs,
Has, to my Disadvantage, told
An Action throughly Bright and Bold;
Has said, that I foul Play had us'd,
And with my Weight th' Opposer bruis'd;
Had laid my Trunk about his Brawn,
Before his Tushes cou'd be drawn;
Had stunn'd him with a hideous Roar,
And twenty-thousand Scandals more:
But I defy the Talk of Men,
Or Voice of Brutes in ev'ry Den;
Th' impartial Skies are all my Care,
And how it stands Recorded there.
Amongst you Gods, pray, What is thought?
   Quoth Mercury–Then have you Fought!
  Solicitous thus shou'd I be
For what's said of my Verse and Me;

RHYME a a a b b 

Or shou'd my Friends Excuses frame,
And beg the Criticks not to blame

  Our Vanity we more betray,
In asking what the World will say,
Than if, in trivial Things like these,
We wait on the Event with ease;
Nor make long Prefaces, to show
What Men are not concern'd to know:
For still untouch'd how we succeed,
'Tis for themselves, not us, they Read;

RHYME a a a b b 

Whilst that proceeding to requite,
We own (who in the Muse delight)
'Tis for our Selves, not them, we Write.
Betray'd by Solitude to try
Amusements, which the Prosp'rous fly;

How vain is Life! which rightly we compare
  To flying Posts, that haste away;
To Plants, that fade with the declining Day;
  To Clouds, that sail amidst the yielding Air;
Till by Extention into that they flow,
  Or, scatt'ring on the World below,
Are lost and gone, ere we can say they were;
  To Autumn-leaves, which every Wind can chace;
To rising Bubbles, on the Waters Face;
  To fleeting Dreams, that will not stay,

RHYME a b b a c d c d e f g h h g 

Nor in th' abused Fancy dance,
  When the returning Rays of Light,
Resuming their alternate Right,
Break on th' ill-order'd Scene on the fantastick Trance:
As weak is Man, whilst Tenant to the Earth;
As frail and as uncertain all his Ways,
From the first moment of his weeping Birth,
Down to the last and best of his few restless Days;
  When to the Land of Darkness he retires
From disappointed Hopes, and frustrated Desires;
  Reaping no other Fruit of all his Pain
Bestow'd whilst in the vale of Tears below,
  But this unhappy Truth, at last to know,
That Vanity's our Lot, and all Mankind is Vain.

  A studious Boy, advanc'd beyond his Age,
Wastes the dim Lamp, and turns the restless Page;
  For some lov'd Book prevents the rising Day,
  And on it, stoln aside, bestows the Hours of Play;
Him the observing Master do's design
For search of darkned Truths and Mysteries Divine;
  Bids him with unremitted Labour trace
The Rise of Empires, and their various Fates,
The several Tyrants o'er the several States,
  To Babel's lofty Towers, and warlike Nimrod's Race;
Bids him in Paradice the Bank survey,
  Where Man, new-moulded from the temper'd Clay,
(Till fir'd with Breath Divine) a helpless Figure lay:
  Could he be led thus far---What were the Boast,
  What the Reward of all the Toil it cost,
What from that Land of ever-blooming Spring,
  For our Instruction could he bring,
Unless, that having Humane Nature found
Unseparated from its Parent Ground,

  The Epicure in soft Array,

His rude unhospitable Door,
  Unpity'd but by Brutes, a broken Carcass lay,
Were both alike deriv'd from the same common Earth?
  But ere the Child can to these Heights attain,
  Ere he can in the Learned Sphere arise;
  A guilding Star, attracting to the Skies,
A fever, seizing the o'er labour'd Brain,
  Sends him, perhaps, to Death's concealing Shade;
Where, in the Marble Tomb now silent laid,
  He better do's that useful Doctrine show,
  (Which all the sad Assistants ought to know,
  Who round the Grave his short continuance mourn)
That first from Dust we came, and must to Dust return.

Flies, like a rushing Storm by mighty Whirlwinds driv'n;

  The safe, but harder Labours of the Gown,
  The softer pleasures of the Courtly Town,
The once lov'd rural Sports, and Chaces on the Plains;
  Does with the Soldier's Life the Garb assume,
  The gold Embroid'ries, and the graceful Plume;
  Walks haughty in a Coat of Scarlet Die,
  A Colour well contriv'd to cheat the Eye,
Where richer Blood, alas! may undistinguisht lye.
  And oh! too near that wretched Fate attends;
  Hear it ye Parents, all ye weeping Friends!
  Thou fonder Maid! won by these gaudy Charms,

  Now fainting Dye upon the mournful Sound,
That speaks his hasty Death, and paints the fatal Wound!

Could ease that lab'ring Grief, or heal a Lover's Smart.
  See Great Antonius now impatient stand,
      Expecting, with mistaken Pride,
  On Cydnus crowded Shore, on Cydnus fatal Strand,
  A Queen, at his Tribunal to be try'd,
  A Queen that arm'd in Beauty, shall deride
  His feeble Rage, and his whole Fate command:
  O'er the still Waves her burnisht Galley moves,
  Row'd by the Graces, whilst officious Loves
  To silken Cords their busie Hands apply,
  Or gathering all the gentle Gales that fly,
  To their fair Mistress with these Spoils repair,
And from their purple Wings disperse the balmy Air.
  Hov'ring Perfumes ascend in od'rous Clouds,
  Curl o'er the Barque, and play among the Shrouds;

With all the Pride of Persia loosely spread,
  The lovely Syrene lay.
  Which but discern'd from the yet distant Shore,
  Th' amazed Emperor could hate no more;
  No more a baffled Vengeance could pursue;
  But yielding still, still as she nearer drew,
  When Cleopatra anchor'd in the Bay,
  Where every Charm cou'd all its Force display,
Like his own Statue stood, and gaz'd the World away.

    From near Captivity and Shame,
    The vanquish'd, the abandon'd Dame
  Proffers the Arm, that held another's Right,
  To the destructive Snake's more just Embrace,
And courts deforming Death, to mend his Leaden Pace.

" And when his Body falls in Funeral Fire,
  When late revolving Ages shall consume
  The very Pillars, that support his Tomb,

  Deluded Wretch! grasping at future Praise,
    Now planting, with mistaken Care,
  Round thy enchanted Palace in the Air,
  A Grove, which in thy Fancy time shall raise,
  A Grove of soaring Palms, and everlasting Bays;

  As thy Imagination wou'd contrive;
  Should numerous Cities, in a vain contest,
    Struggle for thy famous Birth;
Should the sole Monarch of the conquer'd Earth,
  His wreathed Head upon thy Volume rest;
    Like Maro, could'st thou justly claim,
    Amongst th' inspired tuneful Race,
  The highest Room, the undisputed Place;
  And after near Two Thousand Years of Fame,

    Th' unequal'd Poems made their own,
  In such a Dress, in such a perfect Stile
  As on his Labours Dryden now bestows,
  As now from Dryden's just Improvement flows,
In every polish'd Verse throughout the British Isle;
  What Benefit alas! would to thee grow?
  What Sense of Pleasure wou'dst thou know?
  What swelling Joy? what Pride? what Glory have,
  When in the Darkness of the abject Grave,
  Insensible, and Stupid laid below,
  No Atom of thy Heap, no Dust wou'd move,
For all the airy Breath that form'd thy Praise above?

  True, says the Man to Luxury inclin'd;
  Without the Study of uncertain Art,

  The Orange-Bloom, that with such Sweetness blows,
    Anacreon's celebrated Rose,
  The Hyacinth, with every beauteous Flower,
  Which just this happy Moment shall disclose,
Are out of Fortune's reach, and all within our Power.
  Such costly Garments let our Slaves prepare,
  As for the gay Demetrius were design'd;
  Where a new Sun of radiant Diamonds shin'd,
Where the enamel'd Earth, and scarce-discerned Air,
    With a transparent Sea were seen,
  A Sea composed of the Em'rald's Green,

RHYME a a b c c b d d e e f g g f f f 

  And with a golden Shore encompass'd round;
Where every Orient Shell, of wondrous shape was found.
  The whole Creation on his Shoulders hung,
  The whole Creation with his Wish comply'd,
Did swiftly, for each Appetite provide,
    And fed them all when Young.
  No less, th' Assyrian Prince enjoy'd,
Of Bliss too soon depriv'd, but never cloy'd,
  Whose Counsel let us still pursue,
Whose Monument, did this Inscription shew
  To every Passenger, that trod the way,
Where, with a slighting Hand, and scornful Smile
The proud Effigies, on th' instructive Pile,
  A great Example lay.
I, here Entomb'd, did mighty Kingdoms sway,
Two Cities rais'd in one prodigious Day:

Thou wand'ring Traveller, no longer gaze,
No longer dwell upon this useless Place;
Go Feed, and Drink, in Sports consume thy Life;
For All that else we gain's not worth a Moment's Strife.

  When now the Glass has gone a frequent round;
    When soaring Fancy lightly swims,
  Fancy, that keeps above, and dances o'er the Brims;

  Whilst weighty Reason sinks, and in the bottom's drown'd;
  Adds to his Own, an artificial Fire,
    Doubling ev'ry hot Desire,
  Till th' auxiliary Spirits, in a Flame,
  The Stomach's Magazine defy,
  That standing Pool, that helpless Moisture nigh,
  Thro' every Vital part impetuous fly,
    And quite consume the Frame;
  When to the Under-world despis'd he goes,
  A pamper'd Carcase on the Worms bestows,

  Through ev'ry Vanity beneath the Sun,
  Lest thy o'erweary'd Reader, should complain,
    That of all Vanities beside,
  Which thine, or his Experience e'er have try'd,
Thou art, too tedious Muse, most frivolous and vain;

Till Universal Awe, enslav'd Mankind is taught;

  That, should he lead an Army to the Field,
    For whose still necessary Use,
  Th' extended Earth cou'd not enough produce,
Nor Rivers to their Thirst a full Contentment yield;
  Yet, must their dark Reverse of Fate
  Roll round, within that Course of Years,
  Within the short, the swift, and fleeting Date
  Prescrib'd by Xerxes, when his falling Tears
  Bewail'd those Numbers, which his Sword employ'd,
And false, Hyena-like, lamented and destroy'd.
  Tell Him, that does some stately Building raise,
    A Windsor or Versailles erect,
  And thorough all Posterity expect,
With its unshaken Base, a firm unshaken Praise;
  Tell Him, Judea's Temple is no more,
  Upon whose Splendour, Thousands heretofore

Spent the astonish'd Hours, forgetful to Adore:
  Tell him, into the Earth agen is hurl'd,
  That most stupendious Wonder of the World,
  Justly presiding o'er the boasted Seven,
  By humane Art and Industry design'd,
  This! the rich Draught of the Immortal Mind,
    The Architect of Heaven.

RHYME a a b b c d d c c 

  Remember then, to fix thy Aim on High,
  Project, and build on t'other side the Sky,
  For, after all thy vain Expence below,
  Thou canst no Fame, no lasting Pleasure know;
  No Good, that shall not thy Embraces fly;
  Or thou from that be in a Moment caught,
  Thy Spirit to new Claims, new Int'rests brought,
  Whilst unconcern'd thy secret Ashes lye,
Or stray about the Globe, O Man ordain'd to Dye!

A Female, to a Drunkard marry'd,
When all her other Arts miscarry'd,
Had yet one Stratagem to prove him,
And from good Fellowship remove him;
Finding him overcome with Tipple,
And weak, as Infant at the Nipple,
She to a Vault transports the Lumber,
And there expects his breaking Slumber.
A Table she with Meat provided,
And rob'd in Black, stood just beside it;
Seen only, by one glim'ring Taper,
That blewly burnt thro' misty Vapor.
At length he wakes, his Wine digested,
And of her Phantomship requested,
To learn the Name of that close Dwelling,
And what offends his Sight and Smelling;

And of what Land she was the Creature,
With outspread Hair, and ghastly Feature?
Mortal, quoth she, (to Darkness hurry'd)
Know, that thou art both Dead and Bury'd;
Convey'd, last Night, from noisie Tavern,
To this thy still, and dreary Cavern.
What strikes thy Nose, springs from the Shatters
Of Bodies kill'd with Cordial Waters,
Stronger than other Scents and quicker,
As urg'd by more spirituous Liquor.
My self attend on the Deceas'd,
When all their Earthly Train's releas'd;
And in this Place of endless Quiet,
My Bus'ness is, to find them Diet;
To shew all sorts of Meats, and Salades,
Till I'm acquainted with their Palates;
But that once known, then less suffices.

Or break this Habit thou'st been getting,
To keep thy Throat in constant wetting.

A Vizir, whom he formerly had known,
When at the Port he bore deputed Sway,
And made the Nations with a Nod obey.
Now all serene, and splendid was his Brow,
Whilst ready Waiters to his Orders bow;
His Residence, an artful Garden seem'd,
Adorn'd with all, that pleasant he esteem'd;
Full of Reward, his glorious Lot appear'd,

And if, when you behold her Face,
You e'er desire to quit the Place,

But you, perhaps, are by the Ear,

So sprightly was the Tune he chose,
  And often did repeat;
That Phillis, tho' not up she rose,
Kept time with every thrilling Close,

Reputation, Love, and Death,
(The Last all Bones, the First all Breath,
The Midd'st compos'd of Restless Fire)
From each other wou'd Retire;
Thro' the World resolv'd to stray;
Every One a several Way;
Exercising, as they went,
Each such Power, as Fate had lent;
Which, if it united were,
Wretched Mortals cou'd not bear:
But as parting Friends do show,
To what Place they mean to go,
Correspondence to engage,
Nominate their utmost Stage;

RHYME a a *

Death declar'd he wou'd be found
Near the fatal Trumpet's sound;
Or where Pestilences reign,
And Quacks the greater Plagues maintain;
Shaking still his sandy Glass,
And mowing Human Flesh, like Grass.
Love, as next his Leave he took,
Cast on both so sweet a Look,

RHYME a a *

As their Tempers near disarm'd,
One relax'd, and t'other warm'd;
Shades for his Retreat he chose,
Rural Plains, and soft Repose;
Where no Dowry e'er was paid,
Where no Jointure e'er was made;
No Ill Tongue the Nymph perplex'd,
Where no Forms the Shepherd vex'd;
Where Himself shou'd be the Care,
Of the Fond and of the Fair:
Where that was, they soon should know,
Au Revoir! then turn'd to Go.

RHYME a a *

Reputation made a Pause,
Suiting her severer Laws;
Second Thoughts, and Third she us'd,
Weighing Consequences mus'd;
When, at length to both she cry'd:
You Two safely may Divide,
To th' Antipodes may fall,
And re-ascend th' encompast Ball;

RHYME a a *

Certain still to meet agen
In the Breasts of tortur'd Men;
Who by One (too far) betray'd,
Call in t'other to their Aid:
Whilst I Tender, Coy, and Nice,
Rais'd and ruin'd in a Trice,
Either fix with those I grace,
Or abandoning the Place,
No Return my Nature bears,
From green Youth, or hoary Hairs;
If thro' Guilt, or Chance, I sever,
I once Parting, Part for ever.

Two long had Lov'd, and now the Nymph desir'd,
The Cloak of Wedlock, as the Case requir'd;
Urg'd that, the Day he wrought her to this Sorrow,
He Vow'd, that he wou'd marry her To-Morrow.
Agen he Swears, to shun the present Storm,
That he, To-Morrow, will that Vow perform.
The Morrows in their due Successions came;
Impatient still on Each, the pregnant Dame
Urg'd him to keep his Word, and still he swore the same.
When tir'd at length, and meaning no Redress,
But yet the Lye not caring to confess,
He for his Oath this Salvo chose to borrow,
That he was Free, since there was no To-Morrow;
For when it comes in Place to be employ'd,
'Tis then To-Day; To-Morrow's ne'er enjoy'd.

RHYME a a *

The Tale's a Jest, the Moral is a Truth;
To-Morrow and To-Morrow, cheat our Youth:
In riper Age, To-Morrow still we cry,
Not thinking, that the present Day we Dye;
Unpractis'd all the Good we had Design'd;
There's No To-Morrow to a Willing Mind.

RHYME a b a b c c b 

GIVE me O indulgent Fate!
Give me yet, before I Dye,
A sweet, but absolute Retreat,
'Mongst Paths so lost, and Trees so high,
That the World may ne'er invade,
Through such Windings and such Shade,
My unshaken Liberty.

RHYME a a *

   No Intruders thither come!
Who visit, but to be from home;
None who their vain Moments pass,
Only studious of their Glass,
News, that charm to listning Ears;
That false Alarm to Hopes and Fears;
That common Theme for every Fop,
From the Statesman to the Shop,
In those Coverts ne'er be spread,
Of who's Deceas'd, or who's to Wed,
Be no Tidings thither brought,
But Silent, as a Midnight Thought,
Where the World may ne'er invade,
Be those Windings, and that Shade:

RHYME a a *

   Courteous Fate! afford me there
A Table spread without my Care,
With what the neighb'ring Fields impart,
Whose Cleanliness be all it's Art,
When, of old, the Calf was drest,
(Tho' to make an Angel's Feast)
In the plain, unstudied Sauce
Nor Treufle, nor Morillia was;
Nor cou'd the mighty Patriarch's Board
One far-fetch'd Ortolane afford.
Courteous Fate, then give me there
Only plain, and wholesome Fare.
Fruits indeed (wou'd Heaven bestow)
All, that did in Eden grow,
All, but the Forbidden Tree,
Wou'd be coveted by me;
Grapes, with Juice so crouded up,
As breaking thro' the native Cup;

RHYME a a *

Figs (yet growing) candy'd o'er,
By the Sun's attracting Pow'r;
Cherries, with the downy Peach,
All within my easie Reach;
Whilst creeping near the humble Ground,
Shou'd the Strawberry be found
Springing wheresoe'er I stray'd,
Thro' those Windings and that Shade.

RHYME a a *

  For my Garments; let them be
What may with the Time agree;
Warm, when Phoebus does retire,
And is ill-supply'd by Fire:
But when he renews the Year,
And verdant all the Fields appear;
Beauty every thing resumes,
Birds have dropt their Winter-Plumes;
When the Lilly full display'd,
Stands in purer White array'd,

RHYME a a *

Than that Vest, which heretofore
The Luxurious (a ) Monarch wore,
When from Salem's Gates he drove,
To the soft Retreat of Love,
Lebanon's all burnish'd House,
And the dear Egyptian Spouse.
Cloath me, Fate, tho' not so Gay;
Cloath me light, and fresh as May:
In the Fountains let me view
All my Habit cheap and new;
Such as, when sweet Zephyrs fly,
With their Motions may comply;
Gently waving, to express
Unaffected Carelessness:

RHYME a a *

No Perfumes have there a Part,
Borrow'd from the Chymists Art:
But such as rise from flow'ry Beds,
Or the falling Jasmin Sheds!
'Twas the Odour of the Field,
Esau's rural Coat did yield,
That inspir'd his Father's Pray'r,
For Blessings of the Earth and Air:
Of Gums, or Pouders had it smelt;
The Supplanter, then unfelt,

RHYME a a *

Easily had been descry'd
For One that did in Tents abide;
For some beauteous Handmaids Joy,
And his Mother's darling Boy.
Let me then no Fragrance wear,
But what the Winds from Gardens bear,
In such kind, surprizing Gales,
As gather'd from (b ) Fidentia's Vales,
All the Flowers that in them grew;
Which intermixing, as they flew,

RHYME a a *

In wreathen Garlands dropt agen,
On Lucullus, and his Men;
Who, chear'd by the victorious Sight,
Trebl'd Numbers put to Flight.
Let me, when I must be fine,
In such natural Colours shine;
Wove, and painted by the Sun,
Whose resplendent Rays to shun,
When they do too fiercely beat,
Let me find some close Retreat,
Where they have no Passage made,
Thro' those Windings, and that Shade.

RHYME a a *

  Give me there (since Heaven has shown
It was not Good to be alone)
A Partner suited to my Mind,
Solitary, pleas'd and kind;
Who, partially, may something see
Preferr'd to all the World in me;

RHYME a a *

Slighting, by my humble Side,
Fame and Splendor, Wealth and Pride.
When but Two the Earth possest,
'Twas their happiest Days, and best;
They by Bus'ness, nor by Wars,
They by no Domestick Cares,
From each other e'er were drawn,
But in some Grove, or flow'ry Lawn,
Spent the swiftly flying Time,
Spent their own, and Nature's Prime,
In Love; that only Passion given
To perfect Man, whilst Friends with Heaven.
Rage, and Jealousie, and Hate,
Transports of his fallen State,
(When by Satan's Wiles betray'd)
Fly those Windings, and that Shade!

RHYME a a *

  Thus from Crouds, and Noise remov'd,
Let each Moment be improv'd;

RHYME a a *

Every Object still produce,
Thoughts of Pleasure, and of Use:
When some River slides away,
To encrease the boundless Sea;
Think we then, how Time do's haste,
To grow Eternity at last,
By the Willows, on the Banks,
Gather'd into social Ranks,
Playing with the gentle Winds,
Strait the Boughs, and smooth the Rinds,
Moist each Fibre, and each Top,
Wearing a luxurious Crop,
Let the time of Youth be shown,
The time alas! too soon outgrown;
Whilst a lonely stubborn Oak,
Which no Breezes can provoke,
No less Gusts persuade to move,
Than those, which in a Whirlwind drove,
Spoil'd the old Fraternal Feast,
And left alive but one poor Guest;

RHYME a a *

Rivell'd the distorted Trunk,
Sapless Limbs all bent, and shrunk,
Sadly does the Time presage,
Of our too near approaching Age.
When a helpless Vine is found,
Unsupported on the Ground,
Careless all the Branches spread,
Subject to each haughty Tread,
Bearing neither Leaves, nor Fruit,
Living only in the Root;

RHYME a a *

Back reflecting let me say,
So the sad Ardelia lay;
Blasted by a Storm of Fate,
Felt, thro' all the British State;
Fall'n, neglected, lost, forgot,
Dark Oblivion all her Lot;
Faded till Arminda's Love,
(Guided by the Pow'rs above)
Warm'd anew her drooping Heart,
And Life diffus'd thro' every Part;

RHYME a a *

Mixing Words, in wise Discourse,
Of such Weight and wond'rous Force,
As could all her Sorrows charm,
And transitory Ills disarm;
Chearing the delightful Day,
When dispos'd to be more Gay,
With Wit, from an unmeasured Store,
To Woman ne'er allow'd before.
What Nature, or refining Art,
All that Fortune cou'd impart,
Heaven did to Arminda send;
Then gave her for Ardelia's Friend:

RHYME a a *

To her Cares the Cordial drop,
Which else had overflow'd the Cup.
So, when once the Son of Jess,
Every Anguish did oppress,
Hunted by all kinds of Ills,
Like a Partridge on the Hills;
Trains were laid to catch his Life,
Baited with a Royal Wife,

RHYME a a *

From his House, and Country torn,
Made a Heathen Prince's Scorn;
Fate, to answer all these Harms,
Threw a Friend into his Arms.
Friendship still has been design'd,
The Support of Human-kind;
The safe Delight, the useful Bliss,
The next World's Happiness, and this.
Give then, O indulgent Fate!
Give a Friend in that Retreat
(Tho' withdrawn from all the rest)
Still a Clue, to reach my Breast.
Let a Friend be still convey'd
Thro' those Windings, and that Shade!

RHYME a a *

  Where, may I remain secure,
Waste, in humble Joys and pure,
A Life, that can no Envy yield;
Want of Affluence my Shield.

RHYME a a *

Thus, had Crassus been content,
When from Marius Rage he went,
With the Seat that Fortune gave,
The commodious ample Cave,
Form'd, in a divided Rock,
By some mighty Earthquake's Shock,
Into Rooms of every Size,
Fair, as Art cou'd e'er devise,
Leaving, in the marble Roof,
('Gainst all Storms and Tempests proof)

RHYME a a *

Only Passage for the Light,
To refresh the chearful Sight,
Whilst Three Sharers in his Fate,
On th' Escape with Joy dilate,
Beds of Moss their Bodies bore,
Canopy'd with Ivy o'er;
Rising Springs, that round them play'd,
O'er the native Pavement stray'd;

RHYME a a *

When the Hour arriv'd to Dine,
Various Meats, and sprightly Wine,
On some neighb'ring Cliff they spy'd;
Every Day a-new supply'd
By a Friend's entrusted Care;
Had He still continu'd there,
Made that lonely wond'rous Cave
Both his Palace, and his Grave;
Peace and Rest he might have found,
(Peace and Rest are under Ground)

RHYME a a *

Nor have been in that Retreat,
Fam'd for a Proverbial Fate;
In pursuit of Wealth been caught,
And punish'd with a golden Draught.
Nor had (d ) He, who Crowds cou'd blind,
Whisp'ring with a snowy Hind,
Made 'em think that from above,
(Like the great Imposter's Dove)
Tydings to his Ears she brought,
Rules by which he march'd and fought,

RHYME a a *

After Spain he had o'er-run,
Cities sack'd, and Battles won,
Drove Rome's Consuls from the Field,
Made her darling Pompey yield,
At a fatal, treacherous Feast,
Felt a Dagger in his Breast;
Had he his once-pleasing Thought
Of Solitude to Practice brought;
Had no wild Ambition sway'd;
In those Islands had he stay'd,
Justly call'd the Seats of Rest,
Truly (e ) Fortunate, and Blest,

RHYME a a *

By the ancient Poets giv'n
As their best discover'd Heav'n.
Let me then, indulgent Fate!
Let me still, in my Retreat,
From all roving Thoughts be freed,
Or Aims, that may Contention breed:

RHYME a a *

Nor be my Endeavours led
By Goods, that perish with the Dead!
Fitly might the Life of Man
Be indeed esteem'd a Span,
If the present Moment were
Of Delight his only Share;
If no other Joys he knew
Than what round about him grew:
But as those, who Stars wou'd trace
From a subterranean Place,

RHYME a a *

Through some Engine lift their Eyes
To the outward, glorious Skies;
So th' immortal Spirit may,
When descended to our Clay,
From a rightly govern'd Frame
View the Height, from whence she came;
To her Paradise be caught,
And things unutterable taught.
Given me then, in that Retreat,
Give me, O indulgent Fate!

RHYME a a *

For all Pleasures left behind,
Contemplations of the Mind.
Let the Fair, the Gay, the Vain
Courtship and Applause obtain;
Let th' Ambitious rule the Earth;
Let the giddy Fool have Mirth;

RHYME a a *

Give the Epicure his Dish,
Ev'ry one their sev'ral Wish;
Whilst my Transports I employ
On that more extensive Joy,
When all Heaven shall be survey'd
From those Windings and that Shade.

When Poets gave their God in Crete a Birth,
Then Jupiter held Traffick with the Earth,
And had a Farm to Lett: the Fine was high,
For much the Treas'ry wanted a Supply,
By Danae's wealthy Show'r exhausted quite, and dry.

RHYME a a *

But Merc'ry, who as Steward kept the Court,
So rack'd the Rent, that all who made Resort
Unsatisfy'd return'd, nor could agree
To use the Lands, or pay his secret Fee;
'Till one poor Clown (thought subt'ler than the rest,
Thro' various Projects rolling in his Breast)
Consents to take it, if at his Desire
All Weathers tow'rds his Harvest may conspire;

The filling Rains may come, and Phoebus glow.

The Care of Heav'n; the Owner's Cares may cease.
Whilst the new Tenant, anxious in his Mind,
Now asks a Show'r, now craves a rustling Wind
To Raise what That had lodg'd, that he the Sheaves may bind.
The Sun, th'o'er-shadowing Clouds, the moistning Dews
He with such Contrariety does chuse;
So often and so oddly shifts the Scene,
Whilst others Load, he scarce has what to Glean.

RHYME a a b b b 

  O Jupiter! with Famine pinch'd he cries,
No more will I direct th' unerring Skies;

Fortune well-Pictur'd on a rolling Globe,
With waving Locks, and thin transparent Robe,
A Man beholding, to his Neighbor cry'd,
Whoe'er would catch this Dame, must swiftly ride.
Mark, how she seems to Fly, and with her bears,
All that is worth a busie Mortal's Cares:

As if the Earth had lent it all her Mines;

At random Here a Diadem she flings,
And There a scarlet Hat with dangling Strings,
And to ten Thousand Fools ten Thousand glorious Things.
Shall I then stay at Home, Dull and Content
With Quarter-Days, and hard extorted Rent?
No, I'll to Horse, to Sea, to utmost Isles,
But I'll encounter her propitious Smiles:
Whilst you in slothful Ease may chuse to Sleep,
And scarce the few Paternal Acres keep.
Farewel, reply'd his Friend, may you advance,
And grow the Darling of this Lady Chance:
Whilst I indeed, not courting of her Grace,
Shall dwell content, in this my Native Place,
Hoping I still shall for your Friend be known:
But if too big for such Acquaintance grown,

RHYME a a a b b c c d d d e e e f f g g g 

I shan't be such a fond mistaken Sot,
To think Remembrance should become my Lot;
When you Exalted, have your self Forgot.
Nor me Ambitious ever shall you find,
Or hunting Fortune, who, they say, is Blind:
But if her Want of Sight shou'd make her Stray,
She shou'd be Welcome, if she came this way.
'Tis very like (the Undertaker cry'd)
That she her steps to these lost Paths shou'd guide:
But I lose Time, whilst I such Thoughts deride.
Away he goes, with Expectation chear'd,
But when his Course he round the World had steer'd,
And much had borne, and much had hop'd and fear'd,
Yet cou'd not be inform'd where he might find
This fickle Mistress of all Human-kind:
He quits at length the Chace of flying Game,
And back as to his Neighbor's House he came,
He there encounters the uncertain Dame;

Who lighting from her gaudy Coach in haste,
To him her eager Speeches thus addrest.
Fortune behold, who has been long pursu'd,
Whilst all the Men, that have my Splendors view'd,
Madly enamour'd, have such Flatt'ries forg'd,
And with such Lies their vain Pretensions urg'd,
That Hither I am fled to shun their Suits,
And by free Choice conclude their vain Disputes;
Whilst I the Owner of this Mansion bless,
And he unseeking Fortune shall possess.
Tho' rightly charg'd as something Dark of Sight,
Yet Merit, when 'tis found, is my Delight;
To Knaves and Fools, when I've some Grace allow'd,
'T has been like scattering Money in a Croud,
To make me Sport, as I beheld them strive,
And some observ'd (thro' Age) but Half-alive;
Scrambling amongst the Vigorous and Young,
One proves his Sword, and One his wheedling Tongue,
All striving to obtain me right or wrong;

Why shou'd We Two continue here,
To serve and cook such homely Cheer?
Who tho' we move with awkward pace,
Your stony Bowels, and my Face,
Abroad can't miss of Wealth and Place.
Then let us instantly be going,
And see what in the World is Doing.
The bloated Jugg, supine and lazy,
Who made no Wish, but to be easy,
Nor, like it's Owner, e'er did think
Of ought, but to be fill'd with Drink;
Yet something mov'd by this fine Story,
And frothing higher with Vain-glory,
Reply'd, he never wanted Metal,
But had not Sides, like sturdy Kettle,
That in a Croud cou'd shove and bustle,
And to Preferment bear the Justle;
When the first Knock would break His Measures,
And stop his Rise to Place and Treasures.

Sure (quoth the Pot ) thy Scull is thicker,
Than ever was thy muddiest Liquor:
Go I not with thee, for thy Guard,
To take off Blows, and Dangers ward?
And hast thou never heard, that Cully
Is borne thro' all by daring Bully?
Your self (reply'd the Drink-conveigher)
May be my Ruin and Betrayer:
A Superiority you boast,
And dress the Meat, I but the Toast:
Than mine your Constitution's stronger,
And in Fatigues can hold out longer;
And shou'd one Bang from you be taken,
I into Nothing shou'd be shaken.
A d'autre cry'd the Pot in scorn,
Dost think, there's such a Villain born,
That, when he proffers Aid and Shelter,
Will rudely fall to Helter-Skelter?
No more, but follow to the Road,
Where Each now drags his pond'rous Load,

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e 

And up the Hill were almost clamber'd,
When (may it ever be remember'd!)
Down rolls the Jugg, and after rattles
The most perfidious of all Kettles;
At every Molehill gives a Jump,
Nor rests, till by obdurate Thump,
The Pot of Stone, to shivers broken,
Sends each misguided Fool a Token:
To show them, by this fatal Test,
That Equal Company is best,
Where none Oppress, nor are Opprest.

But all the Fame, that from the Field was brought,
Employ'd the Loom, where the kind Consort wrought:

No Fact, like this, the Roman cou'd survey,

By diff'rent Aspects shewn, and diff'rent Signs.

Thou Darken'd seem'st, as thou would'st feel the Light;
And with projected Limbs, betray'st a Dread,
Of unseen Mischiefs, levell'd at thy Head.
Thro' all thy Frame such Stupefaction reigns,
As Night it self were sunk into thy Veins:
Nor by the Eyes alone thy Loss we find,
Each Lineament helps to proclaim thee Blind.
An artful Dimness far diffus'd we grant,
And failing seem all Parts through One important Want.

RHYME a a *

  Oh! Mighty RAPHAEL, justly sure renown'd!
Since in thy Works such Excellence is found;
No Wonder, if with Nature Thou'rt at strife,
Who thus can paint the Negatives of Life;
And Deprivation more expressive make,
Than the most perfect Draughts, which Others take.
Whilst to this Chiefest Figure of the Piece,
All that surround it, Heightnings do encrease:
In some, Amazement by Extreams is shewn,
Who viewing his clos'd Lids, extend their Own.
Nor can, by that, enough their Thoughts express,
Which op'ning Months seem ready to confess.

RHYME a a *

  Thus stand the LICTORS gazing on a Deed,
Which do's all humane Chastisements exceed;
Enfeebl'd seem their Instruments of smart,
When keener Words can swifter Ills impart.

RHYME a a *

  Thou, BARNABAS, though Last, not least our Care,
Seem'st equally employ'd in Praise, and Prayer,

RHYME a a *

Acknowledging th' Omnipotent Decree,
Yet soft Compassion in thy Face we see;
Whilst lifted Hands implore a kind Relief,
Tho' no Impatience animates thy Grief;
But mild Suspence and Charity benign,
Do all th' excesses of thy Looks confine.

RHYME a a *

  Thus far, our slow Imagination goes:
Wou'd the more skill'd THEANOR his disclose;
Expand the Scene, and open to our Sight
What to his nicer Judgement gives Delight;
Whose soaring Mind do's to Perfections climb,
Nor owns a Relish, but for Things sublime:
Then, wou'd the Piece fresh Beauties still present,
Nor Length of Time wou'd leave the Eye content:
As moments, Hours; as Hours the Days wou'd seem,
Observing here, taught to observe by HIM.

NOW spent the alter'd King, in am'rous Cares,
The Hours of sacred Hymns and solemn Pray'rs:
In vain the Alter waits his slow returns,
Where unattended Incense faintly burns:
In vain the whisp'ring Priests their Fears express,
And of the Change a thousand Causes guess.
Heedless of all their Censures He retires,
And in his Palace feeds his secret Fires;
Impatient, till from Rabbah Tydings tell,
That near those Walls the poor Uriah fell,
Led to the Onset by a Chosen Few,
Who at the treacherous Signal, soon withdrew;
Nor to his Rescue e'er return'd again,
Till by fierce Ammon's Sword they saw the Victim slain.
'Tis pass'd, 'tis done! the holy Marriage-Knot,
Too strong to be unty'd, at last is cut.

RHYME a a *

And now to Bathsheba the King declares,
That with his Heart, the Kingdom too is hers;
That Israel's Throne, and longing Monarch's Arms
Are to be fill'd but with her widow'd Charms.
Nor must the Days of formal Tears exceed,
To cross the Living, and abuse the Dead.

RHYME a a *

This she denies; and signs of Grief are worn;
But mourns no more than may her Face adorn,
Give to those Eyes, which Love and Empire fir'd,
A melting Softness more to be desir'd;
Till the fixt Time, tho' hard to be endur'd,
Was pass'd, and a sad Consort's Name procur'd:

RHYME a a *

When, with the Pomp that suits a Prince's Thought,
By Passion sway'd, and glorious Woman taught,
A Queen she's made, than Michal seated higher,
Whilst light unusual Airs prophane the hallow'd Lyre.

RHYME a a *

  Where art thou Nathan? where's that Spirit now,
Giv'n to brave Vice, tho' on a Prince's Brow?
In what low Cave, or on what Desert Coast,
Now Virtue wants it, is thy Presence lost?

RHYME a a a b b c c c 

  But lo! he comes, the Rev'rend Bard appears,
Defil'd with Dust his awful silver Hairs,
And his rough Garment, wet with falling Tears.
The King this mark'd, and conscious wou'd have fled,
The healing Balm which for his Wounds was shed:
Till the more wary Priest the Serpents Art,
Join'd to the Dove-like Temper of his Heart,
And thus retards the Prince just ready now to part.

RHYME a a *

Hear me, the Cause betwixt two Neighbors hear,
Thou, who for Justice dost the Sceptre bear:
Help the Opprest, nor let me weep alone
For him, that calls for Succour from the Throne.
Good Princes for Protection are Ador'd,
And Greater by the Shield, than by the Sword.
This clears the Doubt, and now no more he fears
The Cause his Own, and therefore stays and hears:
When thus the Prophet: ––In a flow'ry Plain
A King-like Man does in full Plenty reign;

RHYME a a *

Casts round his Eyes, in vain, to reach the Bound,
Which Jordan's Flood sets to his fertile Ground:
Countless his Flocks, whilst Lebanon contains
A Herd as large, kept by his numerous Swains,
That fill with morning Bellowings the cool Air,
And to the Cedar's shade at scorching Noon repair.
Near to this Wood a lowly Cottage stands,
Built by the humble Owner's painful Hands;

RHYME a a *

Fenc'd by a Stubble-roof, from Rain and Heat,
Secur'd without, within all Plain and Neat.
A Field of small Extent surrounds the Place,
In which One single Ewe did sport and graze:
This his whole Stock, till in full time there came,
To bless his utmost Hopes, a snowy Lamb;

RHYME a a *

Which, lest the Season yet too Cold might prove,
And Northern Blasts annoy it from the Grove,
Or tow'ring Fowl on the weak Prey might sieze,
(For with his Store his Fears must too increase)
He brings it Home, and lays it by his Side,
At once his Wealth, his Pleasure and his Pride;
Still bars the Door, by Labour call'd away,
And, when returning at the Close of Day,

RHYME a a *

With One small Mess himself, and that sustains,
And half his Dish it shares, and half his slender Gains.
When to the great Man's table now there comes
A Lord as great, follow'd by hungry Grooms:

RHYME a a b b c c c 

For these must be provided sundry Meats,
The best for Some, for Others coarser Cates.
One Servant, diligent above the rest
To help his Master to contrive the Feast,
Extols the Lamb was nourished with such Care,
So fed, so lodg'd, it must be Princely Fare;
And having this, my Lord his own may spare.

RHYME a a *

In haste he sends, led by no Law, but Will,
Not to entreat, or purchase, but to Kill.
The Messenger's arriv'd: the harmless Spoil,
Unus'd to fly, runs Bleating to the Toil:
Whilst for the Innocent the Owner fear'd,
And, sure wou'd move, cou'd Poverty be heard.
Oh spare (he cries) the Product of my Cares,
My Stock's Encrease, the Blessing on my Pray'rs;

RHYME a a *

My growing Hope, and Treasure of my Life!
More was he speaking, when the murd'ring Knife
Shew'd him, his Suit, tho' just, must be deny'd,
And the white Fleece in its own Scarlet dy'd;
Whilst the poor helpless Wretch stands weeping by,
And lifts his Hands for Justice to the Sky.

RHYME a a b b b 

  Which he shall find, th' incensed King replies,
When for the proud Offence th' Oppressor dies.
O Nathan! by the Holy Name I swear,
Our Land such Wrongs unpunished shall not bear
If, with the Fault, th' Offender thou declare.

RHYME a a *

  To whom the Prophet, closing with the Time,
Thou art the Man replies, and thine th' ill-natur'd Crime.
Nor think, against thy Place, or State, I err;
A Pow'r above thee does this Charge prefer;
Urg'd by whose Spirit, hither am I brought
T' expostulate his Goodness and thy Fault;

RHYME a a b b b 

To lead thee back to those forgotten Years,
In Labour spent, and lowly Rustick Cares,
When in the Wilderness thy Flocks but few,
Thou didst the Shepherd's simple Art pursue
Thro' crusting Frosts, and penetrating Dew:

RHYME a a *

Till wondring Jesse saw six Brothers past,
And Thou Elected, Thou the Least and Last;
A Sceptre to thy Rural Hand convey'd,
And in thy Bosom Royal Beauties laid;
A lovely Princess made thy Prize that Day,
When on the shaken Ground the Giant lay
Stupid in Death, beyond the Reach of Cries
That bore thy shouted Fame to list'ning Skies,
And drove the flying Foe as fast away,
As Winds, of old, Locusts to Egypt's Sea.

RHYME a a a b b c c 

Thy Heart with Love, thy Temples with Renown,
Th' All-giving Hand of Heav'n did largely crown,
Whilst yet thy Cheek was spread with youthful Down.
What more cou'd craving Man of God implore?
Or what for favour'd Man cou'd God do more?
Yet cou'd not These, nor Israel's Throne, suffice
Intemp'rate Wishes, drawn thro' wand'ring Eyes.

RHYME a a *

One Beauty (not thy own) and seen by chance,
Melts down the Work of Grace with an alluring Glance;
Chafes the Spirit, fed by sacred Art,
And blots the Title AFTER GOD'S OWN HEART;
Black Murder breeds to level at his Head,
Who boasts so fair a Part'ner of his Bed,
Nor longer must possess those envy'd Charms,
The single Treasure of his House, and Arms:
Giving, by this thy Fall, cause to Blaspheme
To all the Heathen the Almighty Name.
For which the Sword shall still thy Race pursue,
And, in revolted Israel's scornful View,

RHYME a a *

Thy captiv'd Wives shall be in Triumph led
Unto a bold Usurper's shameful Bed;
Who from thy Bowels sprung shall seize thy Throne,
And scourge thee by a Sin beyond thy own.

RHYME a a *

Thou hast thy Fault in secret Darkness done;
But this the World shall see before the Noonday's Sun.

RHYME a a *

  Enough! the King, enough! the Saint replies,
And pours his swift Repentance from his Eyes;
Falls on the Ground, and tears the Nuptial Vest,
By which his Crime's Completion was exprest:
Then with a Sigh blasting to Carnal Love,
Drawn deep as Hell, and piercing Heaven, above
Let Me (he cries) let Me attend his Rod,
For I have sinn'd, for I have lost my God.

RHYME a a b b c c c 

  Hold! (says the Prophet ) of that Speech beware,
God ne'er was lost, unless by Man's Despair.
The Wound that is thus willingly reveal'd,
Th' Almighty is as willing should be heal'd.
Thus wash'd in Tears, thy Soul as fair does show
As the first Fleece, which on the Lamb does grow,
Or on the Mountain's top the lately fallen Snow.

RHYME a a b b c c 

Yet to the World that Justice may appear
Acting her Part impartial, and severe,
The Offspring of thy Sin shall soon resign
That Life, for which thou must not once repine;
But with submissive Grief his Fate deplore,
And bless the Hand, that does inflict no more.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e

  Shall I then pay but Part, and owe the Whole?
My Body's Fruit, for my offending Soul?
Shall I no more endure (the King demands)
And 'scape thus lightly his offended Hands?
Oh! let him All resume, my Crown, my Fame;
Reduce me to the Nothing, whence I came;
Call back his Favours, faster than he gave;
And, if but Pardon'd, strip me to my Grave:
  Since (tho' he seems to Lose ) He surely Wins,
Who gives but earthly Comforts for his Sins.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f 

WHY, to our Wonder, in this Place is seen,
Thus discompos'd, and alter'd, Juda's Queen?
May we demand, what Terrors seize your Breast,
Or, why your Steps are to this House addrest,
Where your unguarded Person stands expos'd
To secret Foes, within its Walls inclos'd?
Can it be thought that you remit that Hate?
No more! but Both observe what I relate:
Not, that I mean (recalling Times of Blood)
To make you Judges of the Paths I trod,
When to the empty'd Throne I boldly rose,
Treating all Intercepters as my Foes.

RHYME a a *

'Twas Heav'ns Decree, that I should thus succeed,
Whose following Favour justifies the Deed,
Extending my unlimited Command
From Sea to Sea o'er the obedient Land:
Whilst your Jerusalem all Peace enjoys,
Nor now the' encroaching Philistine destroys,
Nor wandring Arab his Pavilion spreads,
Near Jordan's Banks, nor wastes his flow'ry Meads.
The great Assyrian, Terror of your Kings,
Who bought his Friendship with their holiest Things,
Yields that a Sister, of his pow'rful Race,
Should sway these Realms, and dignify the Place.
Nor need we add the late insulting Foe,
The furious Jehu does this Sceptre know,
And sinks beneath the Load of conscious Fears,
When in Samaria he my Actions hears.
Distrest by Foes, which I've against him rais'd,
He sees me unmolested, fix'd, and pleas'd;

RHYME a a *

At least, till now thus glorious was my State;
But something's threatned from relaxing Fate,
And the last Night, which should have brought me Rest,
Has all these great Ideas dispossest.
A Dream, a Vision, an apparent View
Of what, methinks, does still my Steps pursue,
Hangs on my pensive Heart, and bears it down
More than the weight of an objected Crown,
My Mother (be the Name with Rev'rence spoke!)
Ere chearful Day thro' horrid Shades had broke,

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

Approach'd my Bed, magnificent her Dress,
Her Shape, her Air did Jesabel confess:
Nor seem'd her Face to have refus'd that Art,
Which, in despight of Age, does Youth impart,
And which she practis'd, scorning to decay,
Or to be vanquish'd ev'n in Nature's way.
Thus all array'd, in such defying Pride
As when th' injurious Conqu'ror she descry'd,
And did in height of Pow'r for ill-got Pow'r deride.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f g g h h 

To me she spake, these Accents to me came:
"Thou worthy Daughter of my soaring Fame,
"Tho' with a more transcendent Spirit fill'd,
"Tho' struggling Pow'rs attempt thy Life to shield,
"The Hebrew's God (Oh, tremble at the sound!)
"Shall Thee and Them, and all their Rights confound.
A pitying Groan concludes, no Word of Aid.
My Arms I thought to throw about the Shade
Of that lov'd Parent, but my troubled Sight
No more directed them to aim aright,
Nor ought presented, but a heap of Bones,
For which fierce Dogs contended on the Stones,
With Flakes of mangled Flesh, that quiv'ring still
Proclaim'd the Freshness of the suffer'd Ill;
Distain'd with Blood the Pavement, and the Wall,
Appear'd as in that memorable Fall–

RHYME a a 

Oh! just avenging Heaven!
Sure, Dreams like these are for Prevention given.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e e f f f g g 

What art thou, SPLEEN, which ev'ry thing dost ape?
  Thou Proteus to abus'd Mankind,
  Who never yet thy real Cause cou'd find,
Or fix thee to remain in one continued Shape.
  Still varying thy perplexing Form,
  Now a Dead Sea thou'lt represent,
  A Calm of stupid Discontent,
Then, dashing on the Rocks wilt rage into a Storm.
  Trembling sometimes thou dost appear,
  Dissolv'd into a Panick Fear;
  On Sleep intruding dost thy Shadows spread,
  Thy gloomy Terrours round the silent Bed,
And croud with boading Dreams the Melancholy Head:
  Or, when the Midnight Hour is told,
And drooping Lids thou still dost waking hold,

RHYME a b b a c d d e e c 

  Thy fond Delusions cheat the Eyes,
  Before them antick Spectres dance,
Unusual Fires their pointed Heads advance,
  And airy Phantoms rise.
  Such was the monstrous Vision seen,
When Brutus (now beneath his Cares opprest,
And all Rome's Fortunes rolling in his Breast,
  Before Philippi's latest Field,
Before his Fate did to Octavius lead)
  Was vanquish'd by the Spleen.

RHYME a a b b c c c 

  Falsly, the Mortal Part we blame
  Of our deprest, and pond'rous Frame,
  Which, till the First degrading Sin
  Let Thee, its dull Attendant, in,
  Still with the Other did comply,
Nor clogg'd the Active Soul, dispos'd to fly,
And range the Mansions of it's native Sky.

RHYME a b b a c d d c c d d 

  Nor, whilst in his own Heaven he dwelt,
  Whilst Man his Paradice possest,
His fertile Garden in the fragrant East,
  And all united Odours smelt,
  No armed Sweets, until thy Reign,
  Cou'd shock the Sense, or in the Face
  A flusht, unhandsom Colour place.
Now the Jonquille o'ercomes the feeble Brain;
We faint beneath the Aromatick Pain, [a ]
Till some offensive Scent thy Pow'rs appease,
And Pleasure we resign for short, and nauseous Ease.

RHYME a a b b c c 

  In ev'ry One thou dost possess,
  New are thy Motions, and thy Dress:
  Now in some Grove a list'ning Friend
  Thy false Suggestions must attend,
Thy whisper'd Griefs, thy fancy'd Sorrows hear,
Breath'd in a Sigh, and witness'd by a Tear;

RHYME a a b c d e e d c 

  Whilst in the light, and vulgar Croud,
  Thy Slaves, more clamorous and loud,
By Laughters unprovok'd, thy Influence too confess.
In the Imperious Wife thou Vapours art,
  Which from o'erheated Passions rise
  In Clouds to the attractive Brain,
  Until descending thence again,
  Thro' the o'er-cast, and show'ring Eyes,
  Upon her Husband's soften'd Heart,

RHYME a a b b b 

  He the disputed Point must yield,
Something resign of the contested Field;
Til Lordly Man, born to Imperial Sway,
Compounds for Peace, to make that Right away,
And Woman, arm'd with Spleen, do's servilely Obey.

RHYME a a b b 

  The Fool, to imitate the Wits,
  Complains of thy pretended Fits,
  And Dulness, born with him, wou'd lay
  Upon thy accidental Sway;

RHYME a a b c c b d d d e e f f g h h g i i 

  Because, sometimes, thou dost presume
  Into the ablest Heads to come:
  That, often, Men of Thoughts refin'd,
  Impatient of unequal Sence,
Such slow Returns, where they so much dispense,
Retiring from the Croud, are to thy Shades inclin'd.
  O'er me, alas! thou dost too much prevail:
  I feel thy Force, whilst I against thee rail;
I feel my Verse decay, and my crampt Numbers fail.
Thro' thy black Jaundice I all Objects see,
  As Dark, and Terrible as Thee,
My Lines decry'd, and my Employment thought
An useless Folly, or presumptuous Fault:
  Whilst in the Muses Paths I stray,
Whilst in their Groves, and by their secret Springs
My Hand delights to trace unusual Things,
And deviates from the known, and common way;
  Nor will in fading Silks compose
  Faintly th' inimitable Rose,

RHYME a a a 

Fill up an ill-drawn Bird, or paint on Glass
The Sov'reign's blurr'd and undistinguish'd Face,
The threatning Angel, and the speaking Ass.

RHYME a a b b c d d c c d 

  Patron thou art to ev'ry gross Abuse,
    The sullen Husband's feign'd Excuse,
When the ill Humour with his Wife he spends,
And bears recruited Wit, and Spirits to his Friends.
    The Son of Bacchus pleads thy Pow'r,
    As to the Glass he still repairs,
    Pretends but to remove thy Cares,
Snatch from thy Shades one gay, and smiling Hour,
And drown thy Kingdom in a purple Show'r.
When the Coquette, whom ev'ry Fool admires,

RHYME a b b a 

    Wou'd in Variety be Fair,
    And, changing hastily the Scene
    From Light, Impertinent, and Vain,
  Assumes a soft, a melancholy Air,

RHYME a b c b c a 

  And of her Eyes rebates the wand'ring Fires,
  The careless Posture, and the Head reclin'd,
    The thoughtful, and composed Face,
  Proclaiming the withdrawn, the absent Mind,
  Allows the Fop more liberty to gaze,
  Who gently for the tender Cause inquires;

RHYME a a b c c b d d e e e 

  The Cause, indeed, is a Defect in Sense,
Yet is the Spleen alleg'd, and still the dull Pretence.
    But these are thy fantastic Harms,
    The Tricks of thy pernicious Stage,
    Which do the weaker Sort engage;
  Worse are the dire Effects of thy more pow'rful Charms.
    By Thee Religion, all we know,
    That shou'd enlighten here below,
    Is veil'd in Darkness, and perplext
  With anxious Doubts, with endless Scruples vext,
And some Restraint imply'd from each perverted Text.

RHYME a a b b c c c 

  Whilst Touch not, Taste not, what is freely giv'n,
Is but thy niggard Voice, disgracing bounteous Heav'n.
  From Speech restrain'd, by thy Deceits abus'd,
  To Desarts banish'd, or in Cells reclus'd,
  Mistaken Vot'ries to the Pow'rs Divine,
  Whilst they a purer Sacrifice design,
Do but the Spleen obey, and worship at thy Shrine.

RHYME a a b b b c c d d d 

  In vain to chase thee ev'ry Art we try,
    In vain all Remedies apply,
    In vain the Indian Leaf infuse,
    Or the parch'd Eastern Berry bruise;
Some pass, in vain, those Bounds, and nobler Liquors use.
    Now Harmony, in vain, we bring,
    Inspire the Flute, and touch the String.
    From Harmony no help is had;
Musick but soothes thee, if too sweetly sad,
And if too light, but turns thee gayly Mad.


RHYME a b b a c d d c e e e f f 

    Tho' the Physicians greatest Gains,
    Altho' his growing Wealth he sees
    Daily increas'd by Ladies Fees,
  Yet dost thou baffle all his studious Pains.
    Not skilful Lower thy Source cou'd find,
  Or thro' the well-dissected Body trace
    The secret, the mysterious ways,
By which thou dost surprize, and prey upon the Mind.
  Tho' in the Search, too deep for Humane Thought,
    With unsuccessful Toil he wrought,
  'Til thinking Thee to've catch'd, Himself by thee was caught,
    Retain'd thy Pris'ner, thy acknowleg'd Slave,
And sunk beneath thy Chain to a lamented Grave.

WITH such a Pulse, with such disorder'd Veins,
Such lab'ring Breath, as thy Disease constrains;
With failing Eyes, that scarce the Light endure,
(So long unclos'd, they've watch'd thy doubtful Cure)
To his Hephæstion Alexander writes,
To soothe thy Days, and wing thy sleepless Nights,
I send thee Love: Oh! that I could impart,
As well my vital Spirits to thy Heart!
That, when the fierce Distemper thine wou'd quell,
They might renew the Fight, and the cold Foe repel.
  As on Arbela's Plains we turn'd the Day,
When Persians through our Troops had mow'd their way,
When the rough Scythians on the Plunder run,
And barb'rous Shouts proclaim'd the Conquest won,

'Till o'er my Head (to stop the swift Despair)
The Bird of Jove fans the supporting Air,
Above my Plume does his broad Wings display,
And follows wheresoe'er I force my way:
Whilst Aristander, in his Robe of White,
Shews to the wav'ring Host th' auspicious Sight;
New Courage it inspires in ev'ry Breast,
And wins at once the Empire of the East.
Cou'd He, but now, some kind Presage afford,
That Health might be again to Thee restor'd;
Thou to my Wishes, to my fond Embrace;
Thy Looks the same, the same Majestick Grace,
That round thee shone, when we together went
To chear the Royal Captives in their Tent,
Where Sysigambis, prostrate on the Floor,
Did Alexander in thy Form adore;
Above great Æsculapius shou'd he stand,
Or made immortal by Apelles Hand.
But no reviving Hope his Art allows,
And such cold Damps invade my anxious Brows,

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e 

As, when in Cydnus plung'd, I dar'd the Flood
T' o'er-match the Boilings of my youthful Blood.
But Philip to my Aid repair'd in haste;
And whilst the proffer'd Draught I boldly taste,
As boldly He the dangerous Paper views,
Which of hid Treasons does his Fame accuse.
More thy Physician's Life on Thine depends,
And what he gives, his Own preserves, or ends.
If thou expir'st beneath his fruitless Care,
To Rhadamanthus shall the Wretch repair,
And give strict Answer for his Errors there.

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

  Near thy Pavilion list'ning Princes wait,
Seeking from thine to learn their Monarch's State.
Submitting Kings, that post from Day to Day,
To keep those Crowns, which at my Feet they lay,
Forget th' ambitious Subject of their Speed,
And here arriv'd, only Thy Dangers heed.
The Beauties of the Clime, now Thou'rt away,
Droop, and retire, as if their God of Day

RHYME a a *

No more upon their early Pray'rs would shine,
Or take their Incense, at his late Decline.
Thy Parisatis whom I fear to name,
Lest to thy Heat it add redoubl'd Flame;
Thy lovely Wife, thy Parisatis weeps,
And in her Grief a solemn Silence keeps.
Stretch'd in her Tent, upon the Floor she lies,
So pale her Looks, so motionless her Eyes,
As when they gave thee leave at first to gaze
Upon the Charms of her unguarded Face;
When the beauteous Sisters lowly knelt,
And su'd to those, who more than Pity felt.
To chear her now Statira vainly proves,
And at thy Name alone she sighs, and moves.

RHYME a a a 

  But why these single Griefs shou'd I expose?
The World no Mirth, no War, no Bus'ness knows,
But, hush'd with Sorrow stands, to favour thy Repose.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

Ev'n I my boasted Title now resign,
Not Ammon's Son, nor born of Race Divine,
But Mortal all, oppress'd with restless Fears,
Wild with my Cares, and Womanish in Tears.
Tho' Tears, before, I for lost Clytus shed,
And wept more Drops, than the old Hero bled;
Ev'n now, methinks, I see him on the Ground,
Now my dire Arms the wretched Corpse surround,
Now the fled Soul I wooe, now rave upon the Wound.

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

Yet He, for whom this mighty Grief did spring,
Not Alexander valu'd, but the King.
Then think, how much that Passion must transcend,
Which not a Subject raises but a Friend:
An equal Partner in the vanquished Earth,
A Brother, not impos'd upon my Birth,
Too weak a Tye unequal Thoughts to bind,
But by the gen'rous Motions of the Mind.

RHYME a a a b b b c c 

My Love to thee for Empire was the Test,
Since him, who from Mankind cou'd chuse the best,
The Gods thought only fit for Monarch o'er the rest.
Live then, my Friend; but if that must not be,
Nor Fate will with my boundless Mind agree,
Affording, at one time, the World and Thee;
To the most Worthy I'll that Sway resign,
And in Elysium keep Hyphæstion mine.

RHYME a b b a b 

  CUPID one day ask'd his Mother,
  When she meant that he shou'd Wed?
You're too Young, my Boy, she said:
  Nor has Nature made another
  Fit to match with Cupid's Bed.

RHYME a b a b 

Cupid then her Sight directed
  To a lately Wedded Pair;
Where Himself the Match effected;
  They as Youthful, they as Fair.

RHYME a b a b 

Having by Example carry'd
  This first Point in the Dispute;
WORSELEY next he said's not Marry'd:
  Her's with Cupid's Charms may suit.

RHYME a a b b c c 

On the Banks of the Severn a desperate Maid
(Whom some Shepherd, neglecting his Vows, had betray'd,)
Stood resolving to banish all Sense of the Pain,
And pursue, thro' her Death, a Revenge on the Swain.
Since the Gods, and my Passion, at once he defies;
Since his Vanity lives, whilst my Character dies;

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

No more (did she say) will I trifle with Fate,
But commit to the Waves both my Love and my Hate.
And now to comply with that furious Desire,
Just ready to plunge, and alone to expire,
Some Reflection on Death, and its Terrors untry'd,
Some Scorn for the Shepherd, some Flashings of Pride
At length pull'd her back, and she cry'd, Why this Strife,
Since the Swains are so Many, and I've but One Life?

RHYME a a a 

Why was that baleful Creature made,
Which seeks our Quiet to invade,
And screams ill Omens through the Shade?

RHYME a a a 

'Twas, sure, for every Mortals good,
When, by wrong painting of her Brood,
She doom'd them for the Eagle's Food:

RHYME a a a 

Who proffer'd Safety to her Tribe,
Wou'd she but shew them or describe,
And serving him, his Favour bribe.

RHYME a a a 

When thus she did his Highness tell;
In Looks my Young do all excel,
Nor Nightingales can sing so well.

RHYME a a a 

You'd joy to see the pretty Souls,
With wadling Steps and frowzy Poles,
Come creeping from their secret Holes.

RHYME a a a 

But I ne'er let them take the Air,
The Fortune-hunters do so stare;
And Heiresses indeed they are.

RHYME a a a 

This ancient Yew three hundred Years,
Has been possess'd by Lineal Heirs:
The Males extinct, now All is Theirs.

RHYME a a a 

I hope I've done their Beauties right,
Whose Eyes outshine the Stars by Night;
Their Muffs and Tippets too are White.

RHYME a a a 

The King of Cedars wav'd his Power,
And swore he'd fast ev'n from that Hour,
Ere he'd such Lady Birds devour.

RHYME a a a 

Th' Agreement seal'd, on either part,
The Owl now promis'd, from her Heart,
All his Night-Dangers to divert;

RHYME a a a 

As Centinel to stand and whoop,
If single Fowl, or Shoal, or Troop
Should at his Palace aim or stoop.

RHYME a a a 

But home, one Evening without Meat,
The Eagle comes, and takes his Seat,
Where they did these Conditions treat.

RHYME a a a 

The Mother-Owl was prol'd away,
To seek abroad for needful Prey,
And forth the Misses came to play.

RHYME a a a 

What's here! the hungry Monarch cry'd,
When near him living Flesh he spy'd,
With which he hop'd to be supply'd.

RHYME a a a 

But recollecting, 'twas the Place,
Where he'd so lately promis'd Grace
To an enchanting, beauteous Race;

RHYME a a a 

He paus'd a while, and kept his Maw,
With sober Temperance, in awe,
Till all their Lineaments he saw.

RHYME a a a 

What are these Things, and of what Sex,
At length he cry'd, with Vultur's Becks
And Shoulders higher than their Necks?

RHYME a a a 

These wear no Palatines, nor Muffs
Italian Silks, or Doyley Stuffs,
But motley Callicoes, and Ruffs.

RHYME a a a 

Nor Brightness in their Eyes is seen,
But through the Film a dusky Green,
And like old Margery is their Mien.

RHYME a a a 

Then for my Supper they're design'd,
Nor can be of that lovely Kind,
To whom my Pity was inclin'd.

RHYME a a a 

No more Delays; as soon as spoke,
The Plumes are stripped, the Grisles broke,
And near the Feeder was to choak.

RHYME a a a 

When now return'd the grizly Dame,
(Whose Family was out of Frame)
Against League-Breakers does exclaim.

RHYME a a a 

How! quoth the Lord of soaring Fowls,
(Whilst horribly she wails and howls)
Were then your Progeny but Owls?

RHYME a a a 

I thought some Phoenix was their Sire,
Who did those charming Looks inspire,
That you'd prepar'd me to admire.

RHYME a a a 

Upon your self the Blame be laid;
My Talons you've to Blood betray'd,
And ly'd in every Word you said.

RHYME a a 

Faces or Books, beyond their Worth extoll'd,
Are censur'd most, and thus to pieces pulled.

TITLE

RHYME a a b a a b 

A Fond Athenian Mother brought
A Sculptor to indulge her Thought,
  And carve her Only Son;
Who to such strange perfection wrought,
That every Eye the Statue caught
  Nor ought was left undone.

RHYME a a b a a b 

A youthful Smile adorn'd the Face,
The polish gave that Smile a Grace;
  And through the Marble reigns
(Which well the Artist's Skill cou'd trace,
And in their due Positions place)
  A Thread of purple Veins.

RHYME a a b a a b 

The Parasites about it came,
(Whose Praises were too large to name)
  And to each other said;
The Man so well had reach'd his Aim,
Th' Original cou'd o'er it claim
  Only a native Red.

RHYME a a b a a b 

Mean while a Sage, amidst the Croud,
Thus, with a Precept wise and loud,
  Check'd the Vain-glorious Boy;
By telling him, who now grew proud,
That tho' with Beauty 'twas endow'd,
  The Figure was a Toy:

RHYME a a b a a b 

Of no Advantage to the State,
'Twou'd neither combate, nor debate,
  But idly stand alone;
Bids him beware, whilst Men create
In Stone thus his Resemblance great,
  He proves not like the Stone.

RHYME a b a b 

The Hog, the Sheep, and Goat, carrying to a FAIR.
  Who does not wish, ever to judge aright,
    And, in the Course of Life's Affairs,
  To have a quick, and far extended Sight,

RHYME a a 

    Tho' it too often multiplies his Cares?
And who has greater Sense, but greater Sorrow shares?

RHYME a b a b b 

  This felt the Swine, now carrying to the Knife;
    And whilst the Lamb and silent Goat
  In the same fatal Cart lay void of Strife,
    He widely stretches his foreboding Throat,
Deaf'ning the easy Crew with his outragious Note.

RHYME a b a b b 

  The angry Driver chides th'unruly Beast,
    And bids him all this Noise forbear;
  Nor be more loud, nor clamorous than the rest,
    Who with him travel'd to the neighb'ring Fair.
And quickly shou'd arrive, and be unfetter'd there.

RHYME a b a b b 

  This, quoth the Swine, I do believe, is true,
    And see we're very near the Town;
  Whilst these poor Fools of short, and bounded View,
    Think 'twill be well, when you have set them down,
And eas'd One of her Milk, the Other of her Gown.

RHYME a b a b b 

  But all the dreadful Butchers in a Row,
    To my far-searching Thoughts appear,
  Who know indeed, we to the Shambles go,
    Whilst I, whom none but Belzebub wou'd shear,
Nor but his Dam wou'd milk, must for my Carcase fear.

RHYME a b a b b 

  But tell me then, will it prevent thy Fate?
    The rude unpitying Farmer cries;
  If not, the Wretch who tastes his Suff'rings late,
    Not He, who thro' th'unhappy Future prys,
Must of the Two be held most Fortunate and Wise.

RHYME a a b b b c c d d e e e f f g g 

Soothing his Passions with a warb'ling Sound,
A Shepherd-Swain lay stretch'd upon the Ground;
Whilst all were mov'd, who their Attention lent,
Or with the Harmony in Chorus went,
To something less than Joy, yet more than dull Content.
(Between which two Extreams true Pleasure lies,
O'er-run by Fools, unreach'd-at by the Wise )
But yet, a fatal Prospect to the Sea
Wou'd often draw his greedy Sight away.
He saw the Barques unlading on the Shore,
And guess'd their Wealth, then scorn'd his little Store.
Then wou'd that Little lose, or else wou'd make it more.
To Merchandize converted is the Fold,
The Bag, the Bottle, and the Hurdles sold;
The Dog was chang'd away, the pretty Skell
Whom he had fed, and taught, and lov'd so well.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f f 

In vain the Phillis wept, which heretofore
Receiv'd his Presents, and his Garlands wore.
False and upbraided, he forsakes the Downs,
Nor courts her Smiles, nor fears the Ocean's Frowns.
For smooth it lay, as if one single Wave
Made all the Sea, nor Winds that Sea cou'd heave;
Which blew no more than might his Sails supply:
Clear was the Air below, and Phoebus laugh'd on high.
With this Advent'rer ev'ry thing combines,
And Gold to Gold his happy Voyage joins;
But not so prosp'rous was the next Essay,
For rugged Blasts encounter'd on the way,
Scarce cou'd the Men escape, the Deep had all their Prey.

RHYME a a b b c c 

Our broken Merchant in the Wreck was thrown
Upon those Lands, which once had been his own;
Where other Flocks now pastur'd on the Grass,
And other Corydons had woo'd his Lass.
A Servant, for small Profits, there he turns,
Yet thrives again, and less and less he mourns;

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

Re-purchases in time th'abandon'd Sheep,
Which sad Experience taught him now to keep.
When from that very Bank, one Halcyon Day,
On which he lean'd, when tempted to the Sea,
He notes a Calm; the Winds and Waves were still,
And promis'd what the Winds nor Waves fulfill,
A settl'd Quiet, and Conveyance sure,
To him that Wealth, by Traffick, wou'd procure.

RHYME a a *

But the rough part the Shepherd now performs,
Reviles the Cheat, and at the Flatt'ry storms.
Ev'n thus (quoth he) you seem'd all Rest and Ease,
You sleeping Tempests, you untroubl'd Seas,
That ne'er to be forgot, that luckless Hour,
In which I put my Fortunes in your Pow'r;
Quitting my slender, but secure Estate,
My undisturb'd Repose, my sweet Retreat,
For Treasures which you ravish'd in a Day,
But swept my Folly, with my Goods, away.
Then smile no more, nor these false Shews employ,
Thou momentary Calm, thou fleeting Joy;

RHYME a a a 

No more on me shall these fair Signs prevail,
Some other Novice may be won to Sail,
Give me a certain Fate in the obscurest Vale.

RHYME a b a a b 

To view his stately Walks and Groves,
  A Man of Pow'r and Place
Was hast'ning on; but as he roves,
His Foe the slighted Bramble proves,
  And stops his eager Pace.

RHYME a b a a b 

That Shrub was qualify'd to Bite;
  And now there went a Tale,
That this injurious partial Wight
Had bid his Gard'ner rid it quite,
  And throw it o'er the Pail.

RHYME a b a a b 

Often the Bry'r had wish'd to speak,
  That this might not be done;
But from the Abject and the Weak,
Who no important Figure make,
  What Statesman does not run?

RHYME a b a a b 

But clinging now about his Waste,
  Ere he had time to fly,
My Lord (quoth he) for all your haste,
I'll know why I must be displac'd,
  And 'mongst the Rubbish lie.

RHYME a b a a b 

Must none but buffle-headed Trees
  Within your Ground be seen?
Or tap'ring Yews here court the Breeze,
That, like some Beaux whom Time does freeze,
  At once look Old and Green?

RHYME a b a a b 

I snarl, 'tis true, and sometimes scratch
  A tender-footed Squire;
Who does a rugged Tartar catch,
When me he thinks to over-match,
  And jeers for my Attire.

RHYME a b a a b 

As to Yourself, who 'gainst me fret,
  E'en give this Project o'er:
For know, where'er my Root is set,
These rambling Twigs will Passage get,
  And vex you more and more.

RHYME a b a a b 

No Wants, no Threatnings, nor the Jail
  Will curb an angry Wit:
Then think not to chastise, or rail;
Appease the Man, if you'd prevail,
  Who some sharp Satire writ.

RHYME a b a b 

Silvia, let's from the Croud retire;
  For, What to you and me
(Who but each other do desire)
  Is all that here we see?

RHYME a b a b 

Apart we'll live, tho' not alone;
  For, who alone can call
Those, who in Desarts live with One,
  If in that One they've All?

RHYME a b a b 

The World a vast Meander is,
  Where Hearts confus'dly stray;
Where Few do hit, whilst Thousands miss
  The happy mutual Way:

RHYME a b a b 

Where Hands are by stern Parents ty'd,
  Who oft, in Cupid's Scorn,
Do for the widow'd State provide,
  Before that Love is born:

RHYME a b a b 

Where some too soon themselves misplace;
  Then in Another find
The only Temper, Wit, or Face,
  That cou'd affect their Mind.

RHYME a b a b 

Others (but oh! avert that Fate!)
  A well-chose Object change:
Fly, Silvia, fly, ere 'tis too late;
  Fall'n Nature's prone to range.

RHYME a b a b 

And, tho' in heat of Love we swear
  More than perform we can;
No Goddess, You, but Woman are,
  And I no more than Man.

RHYME a b a b 

Th' impatient Silvia heard thus long;
  Then with a Smile reply'd;
Those Bands cou'd ne'er be very strong,
  Which Accidents divide.

RHYME a b a b 

Who e'er was mov'd yet to go down,
  By such o'er-cautious Fear;
Or for one Lover left the Town,
  Who might have Numbers here?

RHYME a b a b 

Your Heart, 'tis true, is worth them all,
  And still preferr'd the first;
But since confess'd so apt to fall,
  'Tis good to fear the worst.

RHYME a b a b 

In ancient History we meet
  A flying Nymph betray'd;
Who, had she kept in fruitful Crete,
  New Conquest might have made.

RHYME a b a b 

And sure, as on the Beach she stood,
  To view the parting Sails;
She curs'd her self, more than the Flood,
  Or the conspiring Gales.

RHYME a b a b 

False Theseus, since thy Vows are broke,
  May following Nymphs beware:
Methinks I hear how thus she spoke,
  And will not trust too far.

RHYME a b a b 

In Love, in Play, in Trade, in War
  They best themselves acquit,
Who, tho' their Int'rests shipwreckt are,
  Keep unreprov'd their Wit.

O King of Terrors, whose unbounded Sway
All that have Life, must certainly Obey;
The King, the Priest, the Prophet, all are Thine,
Nor wou'd ev'n God (in Flesh) thy Stroke decline.
My Name is on thy Roll, and sure I must
Encrease thy gloomy Kingdom in the Dust.
My soul at this no Apprehension feels,
But trembles at thy Swords, thy Racks, thy Wheels;
Thy scorching Fevers, which distract the Sense,
And snatch us raving, unprepar'd from hence;
At thy contagious Darts, that wound the Heads
Of weeping Friends, who wait at dying Beds.
Spare these, and let thy Time be when it will;
My Bus'ness is to Dye, and Thine to Kill.
Gently thy fatal Sceptre on me lay,
And take to thy cold Arms, insensibly, thy Prey.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e 

Cou'd our First Father, at his toilsome Plough,
Thorns in his Path, and Labour on his Brow,
Cloath'd only in a rude, unpolish'd Skin,
Cou'd he a vain Fantastick Nymph have seen,
In all her Airs, in all her antick Graces,
Her various Fashions, and more various Faces;
How had it pos'd that Skill, which late assign'd
Just Appellations to Each several Kind!
A right Idea of the Sight to frame;
T'have guest from what New Element she came;
T'have hit the wav'ring Form, or giv'n this Thing a Name.

FOR Socrates a House was built,
  Of but inferiour Size;
Not highly Arch'd, nor Carv'd, nor Gilt;
  The Man, 'tis said, was Wise.

RHYME a b a b 

But Mob despis'd the little Cell,
  That struck them with no Fear;
Whilst Others thought, there should not dwell
  So great a Person there.

How shou'd a due Recourse be made

Where shou'd the spacious Cloth be laid,
  Or where the Guests retir'd?

RHYME a b a b 

Believe me, quoth the list'ning Sage,
  'Twas not to save the Charge;
That in this over-building Age,
  My House was not more large.

  Was only meant by me;
Who fear that what too streight you find,

RHYME a a *

Since the Road of Life's so ill;
I, to pass it, use this Skill,
My frail Carriage driving home
To its latest Stage, the Tomb.
Justice first, in Harness strong,
Marches stedfastly along:
Charity, to smooth the Pace,
Fills the next adjoining Trace:
Independance leads the Way,
Whom no heavy Curb do's sway;

RHYME a a *

Truth an equal Part sustains,
All indulg'd the loosen'd Reins:
In the Box fits vig'rous Health,
Shunning miry Paths of Wealth:
Gaiety with easy Smiles,
Ev'ry harsher Step beguiles;
Whilst of Nature, or of Fate
Only This I wou'd intreat:
The Equipage might not decay,
Till the worn Carriage drops away.

RHYME a a *

No Cautions of a Matron, Old and Sage,
Young Rattlehead to Prudence cou'd engage;
But forth the Offspring of her Bed wou'd go,
Nor reason gave, but that he wou'd do so.
Much Counsel was, at parting, thrown away,
Ev'n all, that Mother-Rat to Son cou'd say;

RHYME a a a b b c c d d 

Who follow'd him with utmost reach of Sight,
Then, lost in Tears, and in abandon'd Plight,
Turn'd to her mournful Cell, and bid the World Good-Night.
But Fortune, kinder than her boding Thought,
In little time the Vagrant homewards brought,
Rais'd in his Mind, and mended in his Dress,
Who the Bel-air did every way confess,
Had learnt to flow'r his Wigg, nor brusht away
The falling Meal, that on his Shoulders lay;

RHYME a a b b 

And from a Nutshell, wimbl'd by a Worm,
Took Snuff, and cou'd the Government reform.
The Mother, weeping from Maternal Love,
To see him thus prodigiously improve,

RHYME a a b b c c c 

Expected mighty Changes too, within,
And Wisdom to avoid the Cat, and Gin.
Whom did you chiefly note, Sweetheart, quoth she,
Of all the Strangers you abroad did see?
Who grac'd you most, or did your Fancy take?
The younger Rat than curs'd a noisy Rake,
That barr'd the best Acquaintance he cou'd make;

RHYME a a b b c c c d d e e 

And fear'd him so, he trembl'd ev'ry Part;
Nor to describe him, scarce cou'd have the Heart.
High on his Feet (quoth he) himself he bore,
And terribly, in his own Language, swore;
A feather'd Arm came out from either Side,
Which loud he clapp'd, and Combatants defy'd,
And to each Leg a Bayonette was ty'd:
And certainly his Head with Wounds was sore;
For That, and both his Cheeks a Sanguine Colour wore.
Near Him there lay the Creature I admir'd,
And for a Friend by Sympathy desir'd:

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

His Make, like Ours, as far as Tail and Feet,
With Coat of Furr in parallel do meet;
Yet seeming of a more exalted Race,
Tho' humble Meekness beautify'd his Face:
A purring Sound compos'd his gentle Mind,
Whilst frequent Slumbers did his Eye-lids bind;
Whose soft, contracted Paw lay calmly still,
As if unus'd to prejudice, or kill.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e f f g g h h i i 

I paus'd a while, to meditate a Speech,
And now was stepping just within his reach;
When that rude Clown began his hect'ring Cry,
And made me for my Life, and from th' Attempt to fly.
Indeed 'twas Time, the shiv'ring Beldam said,
To scour the Plain, and be of Life afraid.
Thou base, degen'rate Seed of injur'd Rats,
Thou veriest Fool (she cry'd) of all my Brats;
Would'st thou have shaken Hands with hostile Cats,
And dost not yet thine Own, and Country's Foe,
At this expence of Time, and Travel know?
Alas! that swearing, staring, bullying Thing,
That tore his Throat, and blustered with his Wing,
Was but some paltry, Dunghill, Craven Cock,
Who serves the early Household for a Clock.
And We his Oats, and Barley often steal,
Nor fear, he shou'd revenge the pilfer'd Meal:
Whilst that demure, and seeming harmless Puss
Herself, and mewing Chits regales with Us.

RHYME a a b b b 

If then, of useful Sense thou'st gain'd no more,
Than ere thou'dst past the Threshold of my Door;
Be here, my Son, content to Dress and Dine,
Steeping the List of Beauties in thy Wine,
And neighb'ring Vermin with false Gloss outshine.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e 

  Amongst Mankind a Thousand Fops we see,
Who in their Rambles learn no more than Thee;
Cross o'er the Alpes, and make the Tour of France,
To learn a paltry Song, or antick Dance;
Bringing their Noddles, and Valizes pack'd
With Mysteries, from Shops and Taylors wreck'd:
But what may prejudice their Native Land;
Whose Troops are raising, or whose Fleet is mann'd,
Ne'er moves their Thoughts, nor do they understand.
Thou, my dear Rattlehead, and such as These
Might keep at home, and brood on Sloth and Ease:

RHYME a a a 

Whilst Others, more adapted to the Age,
May vig'rously in Warlike Feats engage,
And live on foreign Spoils, or dying thin the Stage.

Strephon, whose Person ev'ry Grace
  Was careful to adorn;
Thought, by the Beauties of his Face,
In Silvia's Love to find a place,
  And wonder'd at her Scorn.

RHYME a b a a b 

With Bows, and Smiles he did his Part;
  But Oh! 'twas all in vain:
A Youth less Fine, a Youth of Art
Had talk'd himself into her Heart,
  And wou'd not out again.

RHYME a b a a b 

Strephon with change of Habits press'd,
  And urg'd her to admire;
His Love alone the Other dress'd,
As Verse, or Prose became it best,
  And mov'd her soft Desire.

RHYME a b a a b 

This found, his courtship Strephon ends,
  Or makes it to his Glass;
There, in himself now seeks amends,
Convinc'd, that where a Wit pretends,
  A Beau is but an Ass.

RHYME a a b b b 

A Greedy Heir long waited to fulfill,
As his Executor, a Kinsman's Will;
And to himself his Age repeated o'er,
To his Infirmities still adding more;
And nicely kept th' Account of the expected Store:

RHYME a a *

When Death, at last, to either gave Release,
Making One's Pains, the Other's Longings cease:
Who to the Grave must decently convey,
Ere he Possession takes the kindred Clay,
Which in a Coach was plac'd, wherein he rides,
And so no Hearse, or following Train provides;
Rejecting Russel, who wou'd make the Charge
Of one dull tedious Day, so vastly Large.
When, at his Death, the humble Man declar'd,
He wished thus privately to be Interr'd.
And now, the Luggage moves in solemn State,
And what it wants in Number, gains in Weight.

RHYME a a b b b c c 

The happy Heir can scarce contain his Joy,
Whilst sundry Musings do his Thoughts employ,
How he shalt act, now Every thing's his Own,
Where his Revenge, or Favour shall be shown;
Then recollecting, draws a counterfeited Groan.
The Avenues, and Gardens shall be chang'd,
Already he the Furniture has ranged.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f g g g 

To ransack secret Draw'rs his Phancy flies,
Nor can th' appearing Wealth his Mind suffice.
Thus he an Age runs o'er betwixt the Porch
Of his Friend's House, and the adjacent Church:
Whilst the slow Driver, who no reck'ning kept
Of what was left, indulging Nature, slept;
Till on a Bank, so high, the Wheel was borne
That in a Moment All must overturn:
Whilst the rich Heir now finds the giving Dead
Less weighty in his Gold, than in his Lead;
Which falling just on his contriving Breast,
Expell'd the Soul, leaving the corpse to rest
In the same Grave, intended for his Friend.
Then why shou'd We our Days in Wishes spend,
Which, e'er we see fulfill'd, are often at an End?

In gay Sports the time they pass;
Now run, now wrestle on the Grass;
Their painted Wings then nimbly ply,
And ev'ry way for Mast'ry try:
'Till a Contest do's arise,
Who has won th' appointed Prize.
Gentle Love refers the Case
To the next, that comes in Place;
Trusting to his flatt'ring Wiles,
And softens the Dispute with Smiles.
But Folly, who no Temper knows,
Words pursues with hotter Blows:
'Till the eyes of Love were lost,
Which has such Pain to Mortals cost.

Venus hears his mournful Crys,
And repeats 'em, in the Skys,
To Jupiter in Council set,
With Peers for the Occasion met;
In her Arms the Boy she bears,
Bathing him in falling Tears;
And whilst his want of Eyes is shown,
Secures the Judges by her Own.
Folly to the Board must come,
And hear the Tryal and the Doom;
Which Cytherea loudly prays
May be as heavy as the Case:
Which, when All was justly weigh'd,
Cupid's Wings now useless made,
That a staff, his Feet must guide,
Which wou'd still be apt to slide;
This Decree at last was read,
That Love by Folly shou'd be lead.

A Quack, to no true Skill in Physick bred,
With frequent Visits cursed his Patient's Bed;
Enquiring, how he did his Broths digest,
How chim'd his Pulse, and how he took his Rest:
If shudd'ring Cold by Burnings was pursu'd,
And at what time the Aguish Fit renew'd.
The waining Wretch, each day become more faint,
In like proportion doubles his Complaint;

RHYME a a a b b c c 

Now swooning Sweats he begs him to allay,
Now give his Lungs more liberty to play,
And take from empty'd Veins these scorching Heats away:
Or if he saw the Danger did increase,
To warn him fair, and let him part in Peace.
My Life for yours, no Hazard in your Case
The Quack replies; your Voice, your Pulse, your Face,

RHYME a a *

Good Signs afford, and what you seem to feel
Proceeds from Vapours, which we'll help with Steel.
With kindled Rage, more than Distemper, burns
The suff'ring Man, who thus in haste returns:
No more of Vapours, your belov'd Disease,
Your Ignorance's Skreen, your What-you-please,
With which you cheat poor Females of their Lives,
Whilst Men dispute not, so it rid their Wives.
For me, I'll speak free as I've paid my Fees;
My Flesh consumes, I perish by degrees:

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e 

And as thro' weary Nights I count my Pains,
No Rest is left me, and no Strength remains.
All for the Better, Sir, the Quack rejoins:
Exceeding promising are all these Signs.
Falling-away, your Nurses can confirm,
Was ne'er in Sickness thought a Mark of Harm.
The want of Strength is for the Better still;
Since Men of Vigour Fevers soonest kill.
Ev'n with this Gust of Passion I am pleas'd;
For they're most Patient who the most are seiz'd.

RHYME a a a b b c c d d 

But let me see! here's that which all repels:
Then shakes, as he some formal Story tells,
The Treacle-water, mixt with powder'd Shells.
My Stomach's gone (what d'you infer from thence?)
Nor will with the least Sustenance dispense.
The Better; for, where appetite endures,
Meats intermingle, and no Med'cine cures.
The Stomach, you must know, Sir, is a Part–
But, sure, I feel Death's Pangs about my Heart.

RHYME a a b b c c 

  Nay then Farewel! I need no more attend
The Quack replies. A sad approaching Friend
Questions the Sick, why he retires so fast;
Who says, because of Fees I've paid the Last,
And, whilst all Symptoms tow'rd my Cure agree,
Am, for the Better, Dying as you see.

Observe this Piece, which to our Sight does bring
The fittest Posture for the Swedish King;
(Encompass'd, as we think, with Armies round,
Tho' not express'd within this narrow Bound)
Who, whilst his warlike and extended Hand
Directs the foremost Ranks to Charge or Stand,
Reverts his Face, lest That, so Fair and Young,
Should call in doubt the Orders of his Tongue:
Whilst the excited, and embolden'd Rear
Such Youth beholding, and such Features there,
Devote their plainer Forms, and are asham'd to Fear.
Thus! ev'ry Action, ev'ry Grace of thine,
O latest Son of Fame, Son of Gustavus Line!
Affects thy Troops, with all that can inspire
A blooming Sweetness, and a martial Fire,

'Tis fit SERENA shou'd be sung.
High-born SERENA, Fair and Young,
Shou'd be of ev'ry Muse and Voice
The pleasing, and applauded Choice.
But as the Meanest of the Show
Do First in all Processions go:
So, let my Steps pursue that Swain
The humblest of th' inspired Train;
Whose well-meant Verse did just appear,
To lead on the preceding Year:

RHYME a a *

So let my Pen, the next in Fame,
Now wait on fair SERENA's Name;
The second Tribute gladly pay,
And hail this blest returning Day.
But let it not attempt to raise
Or rightly speak SERENA's Praise:
Since with more ease we might declare
How Great her Predecessors were;
How Great that more distinguish'd Peer, 
To whom she owes her Being here;
In whom our Britain lets us see
What once they were, and still shou'd be;
As, when the earliest Race was drown'd,
Some Patterns, from amongst them found,
Were kept to shew succeeding Times
Their Excellence without their Crimes:
More easily we might express
What Vertues do her Mother dress;
What does her Form and Mind adorn,
Of whom th' engaging Nymph was born;

RHYME a a *

What Piety, what generous Love,
Does the enlarged Bosom move
Of Her, whose Fav'rite she appears,
Who more than as a Niece endears.
Such full Perfections obvious lie,
And strike, at first, a Poet's Eye.
Deep Lines of Honour all can hit,
Or mark out a superior Wit;
Consummate Goodness all can show,
And where such Graces shine below:
But the more tender Strokes to trace,
T' express the Promise of a Face,
When but the Dawnings of the Mind
We from the Air unripen'd find;

Which alt'ring, as new Moments rise,
The Pen or Pencil's Art defies;
When Flesh and Blood in Youth appears,
Polish'd like what our Marble wears;
Fresh as that Shade of op'ning Green,
Which first upon our Groves is seen;

RHYME a a *

Enliven'd by a harmless Fire,
And brighten'd by each gay Desire;
These nicer Touches wou'd demand
A Cowley's or a Waller's Hand,
T'explain, with undisputed Art,
What 'tis affects th'enlighten'd Heart,
When ev'ry darker Thought gives way,
Whilst blooming Beauty we survey;
To shew how All, that's soft and sweet,
Does in the fair SERENA meet;
To tell us, with a sure Presage,
The Charms of her maturer Age.

RHYME a a *

When Hothfeild shall (as heretofore
From its far-sought and virtuous Store
It Families of great Renown
Did with illustrious Hymens crown)
When Hothfeild shall such Treasure know,
As fair SERENA to bestow:
Then shou'd some Muse of loftier Wing
The Triumphs of that Season sing;

RHYME a a *

Describe the Pains, the Hopes, the Fears
Of noble Youths, th'ambitious Cares
Of Fathers, the long-fram'd Design,
To add such Splendour to their Line,
Whilst all shall strive for such a Bride
So Educated, and Ally'd.

A WIT, transported with Inditing,
Unpay'd, unprais'd, yet ever Writing;
Who, for all Fights and Fav'rite Friends,
Had Poems at his Fingers Ends;
For new Events was still providing;
Yet now desirous to be riding,
He pack'd-up ev'ry Ode and Ditty
And in Vacation left the City;
So rapt with Figures, and Allusions,
With secret Passions, sweet Confusions;

RHYME a a *

With Sentences from Plays well-known,
And thousand Couplets of his own;
That ev'n the chalky Road look'd gay,
And seem'd to him the Milky Way.
But Fortune, who the Ball is tossing,
And Poets ever will be crossing,
Misled the Steed, which ill he guided,
Where several gloomy Paths divided.
The steepest in Descent he follow'd,
Enclos'd by Rocks, which Time had hollow'd;

RHYME a a *

Till, he believ'd, alive and booted,
He'd reach'd the Shades by Homer quoted.
But all, that he cou'd there discover,
Was, in a Pit with Thorns grown over,
Old Mammon digging, straining, sweating,
As Bags of Gold he thence was getting;
Who, when reprov'd for such Dejections
By him, who liv'd on high Reflections,
Reply'd; Brave Sir, your Time is ended,
And Poetry no more befriended.

RHYME a a *

I hid this Coin, when Charles was swaying;
When all was Riot, Masking, Playing;
When witty Beggars were in fashion,
And Learning had o'er-run the Nation,
But, since Mankind is so much wiser,
That none is valued like the Miser,
I draw it hence, and now these Sums
In proper Soil grow up to Plumbs;
Which gather'd once, from that rich Minute
We rule the World, and all that's in it.

RHYME a a *

But, quoth the Poet,can you raise,
As well as Plumb-trees, Groves of Bays?
Where you, which I wou'd chuse much rather,
May Fruits of Reputation gather?
Will Men of Quality, and Spirit,
Regard you for intrinsick Merit?
And seek you out, before your Betters,
For Conversation, Wit, and Letters?

Fool, quoth the Churl, who knew no Breeding;
Have these been Times for such Proceeding?
Instead of Honour'd, and Rewarded,

Your PRIOR cou'd not keep in Places;
And your VAN-BRUG had found no Quarter,
But for his dabbling in the Morter.

Nor charge Great Men with thriftless Nonsense:

Now grant no Worth in any thing
But so much Money as 'twill bring.
Then, never more from your Endeavours

But if you'll 'scape Contempt, or worse,
Be sure, put Money in your Purse;
Money! which only can relieve you
When Fame and Friendship will deceive you.

And all that he had said allowing)
Behold me and my airy Fancies

Which since Experience too enforces,
I, in that solitary Pit,
Your Gold withdrawn, will hide my Wit:
Till Time, which hastily advances,
And gives to all new Turns and Chances,
Again may bring it into use;
Roscommons may again produce;

RHYME a a *

POOR River, now thou'rt almost dry,
What Nymph, or Swain, will near thee lie?
Since brought, alas! to sad Decay,
What Flocks, or Herds, will near thee stay?
The Swans, that sought thee in thy Pride,
Now on new Streams forgetful ride:
And Fish, that in thy Bosom lay,
Chuse in more prosp'rous Floods to play.
All leave thee, now thy Ebb appears,
To waste thy sad Remains in Tears;
Nor will thy mournful Murmurs heed.
Fly, wretched Stream, with all thy speed,
Amongst those solid Rocks thy Griefs bestow;
For Friends, like those alas! thou ne'er did'st know.
And thou, poor Sun! that sat'st on high;
But late, the Splendour of the Sky;

RHYME a a *

What Flow'r, tho' by thy Influence born,
Now Clouds prevail, will tow'rds thee turn?
Now Darkness sits upon thy Brow,
What Persian Votary will bow?
What River will her Smiles reflect,
Now that no Beams thou can'st direct?
By watry Vapours overcast,
Who thinks upon thy Glories past?
If present Light, nor Heat we get,
Unheeded thou may'st rise, and set.
Not all the past can one Adorer keep,
Fall, wretched Sun, to the more faithful Deep.

Since undermin'd by Time and Frost:

Not the soft Nights, or chearful Days
Thou hast bestow'd, can give thee Praise.

No Benefit, by thee conferr'd,
Can in this time of Storms be heard.
All from thy troubl'd Waters run;
Thy stooping Fabrick all Men shun.
All do thy clouded Looks decline,
As if thou ne'er did'st on them shine.
O wretched Man! to other World's repair;
For Faith and Gratitude are only there.

PEACE! where art thou to be found?
Where, in all the spacious Round,
May thy Footsteps be pursu'd?
Where may thy calm Seats be view'd?
On some Mountain dost thou lie,
Serenely near the ambient Sky,
Smiling at the Clouds below,
Where rough Storms and Tempests grow?
Or, in some retired Plain,
Undisturb'd dost thou remain?
Where no angry Whirlwinds pass,
Where no Floods oppress the Grass.

Fain I thy Retreat wou'd know.
Fain I thee alone wou'd find,
Balm to my o'er-weary'd Mind.

Or our Passions most employs,
Peace opposes, or destroys.
Pleasure's a tumultuous thing,
Busy still, and still on Wing;

RHYME a a *

Flying swift, from place to place,
Darting from each beauteous Face;
From each strongly mingled Bowl
Through th'inflam'd and restless Soul.
Sov'reign Pow'r who fondly craves,
But himself to Pomp enslaves;
Stands the Envy of Mankind,
Peace, in vain, attempts to find.
Thirst of Wealth no Quiet knows,
But near the Death-bed fiercer grows;

Wounding Men with secret Stings,
For Evils it on Others brings.

Farewel, lov'd Youth! since 'twas the Will of Heaven
So soon to take, what had so late been giv'n;
And thus our Expectations to destroy,
Raising a Grief, where we had form'd a Joy;

RHYME a a *

Who once believ'd, it was the Fates Design
In Him to double an Illustrious Line,
And in a second Channel spread that Race
Where ev'ry Virtue shines, with every Grace.
But we mistook, and 'twas not here below
That this engrafted Scion was to grow;
The Seats above requir'd him, that each Sphere
Might soon the Offspring of such Parents share.

RHYME a a b b b c c d d e e 

Resign him then to the supream Intent,
You, who but Flesh to that blest Spirit lent.
Again disrob'd, let him to Bliss retire,
And only bear from you, amidst that Choir,
What, Precept or Example did inspire,
A Title to Rewards, from that rich store
Of Pious Works, which you have sent before.
Then lay the fading Reliques, which remain,
In the still Vault (excluding farther Pain);
Where Kings and Counsellors their Progress close,
And his renowned Ancestors repose;

RHYME a a *

Where COVENTRY withdrew All but in Name, 
Leaving the World his Benefits and Fame;
Where his Paternal Predecessor lies, 
Once large of Thought, and rank'd among the Wise;
Whose Genius in Long-Leat we may behold
(A Pile, as noble as if he'd been told
By WEYMOUTH, it shou'd be in time possest,
And strove to suit the Mansion to the Guest.)
Nor favour'd, nor disgrac'd, there ESSEX sleeps, 
Nor SOMERSET his Master's Sorrows weeps, 
Who to the shelter of th' unenvy'd Grave
Convey'd the Monarch, whom he cou'd not save;
Though, Roman-like, his own less-valu'd Head
He proffer'd in that injur'd Martyr's stead.
Nor let that matchless Female 'scape my Pen, 
Who their Whole Duty taught to weaker Men,
And of each Sex the Two best Gifts enjoy'd,
The Skill to write, the Modesty to hide;

RHYME a a *

Whilst none shou'd that Performance disbelieve,
Who led the Life, might the Directions give.
With such as These, whence He deriv'd his Blood,
Great on Record, or eminently Good,
Let Him be laid, till Death's long Night shall cease,
And breaking Glory interrupt the Peace.
Mean-while, ye living Parents, ease your Grief
By Tears, allow'd as Nature's due Relief.
For when we offer to the Pow'rs above,
Like You, the dearest Objects of our Love;
When, with that patient Saint in Holy Writ,
We've learnt at once to Grieve, and to Submit;
When contrite Sighs, like hallow'd Incense, rise
Bearing our Anguish to th' appeased Skies;
Then may those Show'rs, which take from Sorrow birth,
And still are tending tow'rd this baleful Earth,
O'er all our deep and parching Cares diffuse,
Like Eden's Springs, or Hermon's soft'ning Dews.

RHYME a a b b b c c c d d e e f f g g h h 

But lend your Succours, ye Almighty Pow'rs,
For as the Wound, the Balsam too is Yours.
In vain are Numbers, or persuasive Speech,
What Poets write, or what the Pastors teach,
Till You, who make, again repair the Breach.
For when to Shades of Death our Joys are fled,
When for a Loss, like This, our Tears are shed,
None can revive the Heart, but who can raise the Dead.
But yet, my Muse, if thou hadst softer Verse
Than e'er bewail'd the melancholy Herse;
If thou hadst Pow'r to dissipate the Gloom
Inherent to the Solitary Tomb;
To rescue thence the Memory and Air
Of what we lately saw so Fresh, so Fair;
Then shou'd this Noble Youth thy Art engage
To shew the Beauties of his blooming Age,
The pleasing Light, that from his Eyes was cast,
Like hasty Beams, too Vigorous to last;

RHYME a a *

Where the warm Soul, as on the Confines, lay
Ready for Flight, and for Eternal Day.
Gently dispos'd his Nature shou'd be shown,
And all the Mother's Sweetness made his Own.
The Father's Likeness was but faintly seen,
As ripen'd Fruits are figur'd by the Green.
Nor cou'd we hope, had he fulfill'd his Days,
He shou'd have reach'd WEYMOUTH's unequal'd Praise.
Still One distinguish'd plant each Lineage shews,
And all the rest beneath it's Stature grows.
Of Tully's Race but He possess'd the Tongue,
And none like Julius from the Caesars sprung.
Next, in his harmless Sports he shou'd be drawn
Urging his Courser, o'er the flow'ry Lawn;
Sprightly Himself, as the enliven'd Game,
Bold in the Chace, and full of gen'rous Flame;
Yet in the Palace, Tractable and Mild,
Perfect in all the Duties of a Child;

RHYME a a *

Which fond Reflection pleases, whilst it pains,
Like penetrating Notes of sad Harmonious Strains.
Selected Friendships timely he began,
And siezed in Youth that best Delight of Man,
Leaving a growing Race to mourn his End,
Their earliest and their Ages promis'd Friend.
But far away alas! that Prospect moves,
Lost in the Clouds, like distant Hills and Groves,
Whilst with encreasing Steps we all pursue
What Time alone can bring to nearer View,
That Future State, which Darkness yet involves,
Known but by Death, which ev'ry Doubt resolves.

RHYME a a *

Whilst aery Fictions hastily repair
To fill my Page, and rid my Thoughts of Care,
As they to Birds and Beasts new Gifts impart,

But here, the Critick bids me check this Vein.
Fable, he crys, tho' grown th' affected Strain,
But dies, as it was born, without Regard or Pain.
Whilst of his Aim the lazy Trifler fails,
Who seeks to purchase Fame by childish Tales.

RHYME a a a b b c c 

Then, let my Verse, once more attempt the Skies,
The easily persuaded Poet cries,
Since meaner Works you Men of Taste despise.
The Walls of Troy shall be our loftier Stage,
Our mighty Theme the fierce Achilles Rage.
The Strength of Hector, and Ulysses Arts
Shall boast such Language, to adorn their Parts,

RHYME a a b b c c 

As neither Hobbes, nor Chapman cou'd bestow,
Or did from Congreve, or from Dryden flow.
Amidst her Towers, the dedicated Horse
Shall be receiv'd, big with destructive Force;

" Troy is no more, and Ilium was a Town.

RHYME a a b b b 

Is this the way to please the Men of Taste,
The Interrupter cries, this old Bombast?
I'm sick of Troy, and in as great a Fright,
When some dull Pedant wou'd her Wars recite,
As was soft Paris, when compell'd to Fight.

RHYME a a b b b c c 

To Shades and Springs shall we awhile repair,
The Muse demands, and in that milder Air
Describe some gentle Swain's unhappy Smart
Whose folded Arms still press upon his Heart,
And deeper drive the too far enter'd Dart?
Whilst Phillis with a careless pleasure reigns
The Joy, the Grief, the Envy of the Plains;

RHYME a a 

Heightens the Beauty of the verdant Woods,
And softens all the Murmurs of the Floods.

Oh! stun me not with these insipid Dreams,
Th' Eternal Hush, the Lullaby of Streams.
Which still, he cries, their even Measures keep,
Till both the Writers, and the Readers sleep.
But urge thy Pen, if thou wouldst move our Thoughts,
To shew us private, or the publick Faults.
Display the Times, High-Church or Low provoke;
We'll praise the Weapon, as we like the Stroke,
And warmly sympathizing with the Spite
Apply to Thousands, what of One you write.

The harmless Fable-writer do's reply,
And all the Rest of Helicon be dry?
And when so many choice Productions swarm,
Must only Satire keep your Fancies warm?

As if you'd in the midst of Plenty starve,
Tho' ne'er so liberally we Authors carve.

Reason's lost Throne, and sov'reign Rule maintains.

And proudly still aspires to be possest
Of Her, he thinks superior to the rest.

Improv'd his Flocks, and did the Pastures fill,
That equal Care th' assaulted did defend,
And the secur'd and grazing Part attend,
Approves the Conduct, and from Sheep and Curs
Transfers the Sway, and changed his Wool to Furrs.
Lord-Keeper now, as rightly he divides
His just Decrees, and speedily decides;
When his sole Neighbor, whilst he watch'd the Fold,
A Hermit poor, in Contemplation old,
Hastes to his Ear, with safe, but lost Advice,
Tells him such Heights are levell'd in a trice,
Preferments treach'rous, and her Paths of Ice:

Who thought a Prince's Favour to retain.
Nor seem'd unlike, in this mistaken Rank,
The sightless Wretch, who froze upon a Bank
A Serpent found, which for a Staff he took,
And us'd as such (his own but lately broke)
Thanking the Fates, who thus his Loss supply'd,
Nor marking one, that with amazement cry'd,
Throw quickly from thy Hand that sleeping Ill;
A Serpent 'tis, that when awak'd will kill.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

A Serpent this! th' uncaution'd Fool replies:
A Staff it feels, nor shall my want of Eyes
Make me believe, I have no Senses left,
And thro' thy Malice be of this bereft;
Which Fortune to my Hand has kindly sent
To guide my Steps, and stumbling to prevent.
No Staff, the Man proceeds; but to thy harm
A Snake 'twill prove: The Viper, now grown warm
Confirm'd it soon, and fasten'd on his Arm.

RHYME a a *

  Thus wilt thou find, Shepherd believe it true,
Some Ill, that shall this seeming Good ensue;
Thousand Distastes, t' allay thy envy'd Gains,
Unthought of, on the parcimonious Plains.
So prov'd the Event, and Whisp'rers now defame
The candid Judge, and his Proceedings blame.
By Wrongs, they say, a Palace he erects,
The Good oppresses, and the Bad protects.
To view this Seat the King himself prepares,
Where no Magnificence or Pomp appears,
But Moderation, free from each Extream,
Whilst Moderation is the Builder's Theme.
Asham'd yet still the Sycophants persist,
That Wealth he had conceal'd within a Chest,

RHYME a a *

Which but attended some convenient Day,
To face the Sun, and brighter Beams display.
The Chest unbarr'd, no radiant Gems they find,
No secret Sums to foreign Banks design'd,
But humble Marks of an obscure Recess,
Emblems of Care, and Instruments of Peace;

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f 

The Hook, the Scrip, and for unblam'd Delight
The merry Bagpipe, which, ere fall of Night,
Cou'd sympathizing Birds to tuneful Notes invite.
Welcome ye Monuments of former Joys!
Welcome! to bless again your Master's Eyes,
And draw from Courts, th' instructed Shepherd cries.
No more dear Relicks! we no more will part,
You shall my Hands employ, who now revive my Heart.
No Emulations, nor corrupted Times
Shall falsely blacken, or seduce to Crimes
Him, whom your honest Industry can please,
Who on the barren Down can sing from inward Ease.

RHYME a a b b 

  How's this! the Monarch something mov'd rejoins.
With such low Thoughts, and Freedom from Designs,
What made thee leave a Life so fondly priz'd,
To be in Crouds, or envy'd, or despis'd?

RHYME a a b b b 

  Forgive me, Sir, and Humane Frailty see,
The Swain replies, in my past State and Me;
All peaceful that, to which I vow return.
But who alas! (tho' mine at length I mourn)
Was e'er without the Curse of some Ambition born.

URANIA, whom the Town admires,
  Whose Wit and Beauty share our Praise;
This fair URANIA who inspires
  A thousand Joys a thousand ways,
She, who cou'd with a Glance convey
  Favours, that had my Hopes outdone,
Has lent me Money on that Day,
  Which our Acquaintance first begun.

Nor with the Happiness I taste,
  Let any jealous Doubts contend:
Her Friendship is secure to last,
  Beginning where all others end.

And thou, known Cheat! upheld by Law,
  Thou Disappointer of the craving Mind,
BASSETTE, who thy Original dost draw
  From Venice (by uncertain Seas confin'd);
Author of Murmurs, and of Care,
  Of pleasing Hopes, concluding in Despair:
To thee my strange Felicity I owe,
  From thy Oppression did this Succour flow.
Less had I gained, had'st thou propitious been,
  Who better by my Loss hast taught me how to Win.

Yet tell me, my transported Brain!
  (whose Pride this Benefit awakes)
Know'st thou, what on this Chance depends?
  And are we not exalted thus in vain,
Whilst we observe the Money which she lends,
  But not, alas! the Heart she takes,
The fond Engagements, and the Ties
  Her fatal Bounty does impose,
Who makes Reprisals, with her Eyes,
  For what her gen'rous Hand bestows?

Yet let us quit th' obliging Score;
And whilst we borrow'd Gold restore,
Whilst readily we own the Debt,
And Gratitude before her set

That also in her turn she ought

Kindness with Kindness to requite.

RHYME a a *

Fair Youth! who wish the Wars may cease,
We own you better form'd for Peace.
Nor Pallas you, nor Mars shou'd follow;
Your Gods are Cupid and Apollo;
Who give sweet Looks, and early Rhimes,
Bespeaking Joys, and Halcyon Times.
Your Face, which We, as yet, may praise,
Calls for the Myrtle, and the Bays.
The Martial Crowns Fatigues demand,
And laurell'd Heroes must be tann'd;
A Fate, we never can allow
Shou'd reach your pleasing, polish'd Brow.
But granting what so young you've writ,
From Nature flow'd, as well as Wit;
And that indeed you Peace pursue,
We must begin to Treat with you.

RHYME a a *

We Females, Sir, it is I mean:
Whilst I, like BRISTOL for the QUEEN,
For all the Ladies of your Age
As Plenipo' betimes engage;
And as first Article declare,
You shall be Faithful as you're Fair:
No Sighs, when you shall know their Use,
Shall be discharg'd in Love's Abuse;
Nor kindling Words shall undermine,
Till you in equal Passion join.
Nor Money be alone your Aim,
Tho' you an Over-weight may claim,
And fairly build on your Desert,
If with your Person goes your Heart.
But when this Barrier I have gain'd,
And trust it will be well maintain'd;
Who knows, but some imprudent She
Betraying what's secur'd by me,
Shall yield thro' Verse, or stronger Charms,
To Treat anew on easier Terms?

RHYME a a a 

And I be negligently told�
You was too Young, and I too Old,
To have our distant Maxims hold.

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e 

Sooner I'd praise a Cloud which Light beguiles,
Than thy rash Hand which robs this Face of Smiles;
And does that sweet and pleasing Air controul,
Which to us paints the fair CLEONE's Soul.
'Tis vain to boast of Rules or labour'd Art;
I miss the Look that captivates my Heart,
Attracts my Love, and tender Thoughts inspires;
Nor can my Breast be warm'd by common Fires;
Nor can ARDELIA love but where she first admires.
Like Jupiter's, thy Head was sure in Pain
When this Virago struggl'd in thy Brain;

RHYME a a *

And strange it is, thou hast not made her wield
A mortal Dart, or penetrating Shield,
Giving that Hand of disproportion'd size
The Pow'r, of which thou hast disarm'd her Eyes:
As if, like Amazons, she must oppose,
And into Lovers force her vanquish'd Foes.
Had to THEANOR thus her Form been shown
To gain her Heart, he had not lost his own;
Nor, by the gentlest Bands of Human Life,
At once secur'd the Mistress and the Wife.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e 

For still CLEONE's Beauties are the same,
And what first lighten'd, still upholds his Flame.
Fain his Compassion wou'd thy Works approve,
Were pitying thee consistent with his Love,
Or with the Taste which Italy has wrought
In his refin'd and daily heighten'd Thought,
Where Poetry, or Painting find no place,
Unless perform'd with a superior Grace.
Cou'd but my Wish some Influence infuse,
Ne'er shou'd the Pencil, or the Sister-Muse
Be try'd by those who easily excuse:

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e 

But strictest Censors shou'd of either judge,
Applaud the Artist, and despise the Drudge.
Then never wou'd thy Colours have debas'd
CLEONE's Features, and her Charms defac'd:
Nor had my Pen (more subject to their Laws)
Assay'd to vindicate her Beauty's Cause.
A rigid Fear had kept us both in Awe,
Nor I compos'd, nor thou presum'd to draw;
But in CLEONE viewing with Surprize
That Excellence, to which we ne'er cou'd rise,

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

By less Attempts we safely might have gain'd
That humble Praise which neither has obtain'd,
Since to thy Shadowings, or my ruder Verse,
It is not giv'n to shew, or to rehearse
What Nature in CLEONE's Face has writ,
A soft Endearment, and a chearful Wit,
That all-subduing, that enliv'ning Air
By which, a sympathizing Joy we share,
For who forbears to smile, when smil'd on by the Fair?

    Bright matchless star, the honour of the sky,
    From whose clear shine heaven's vault hath all his light,
    I send these poems to your graceful eye;
    Do you but take them, and they have their right.
    I build besides a temple to your name,
    Wherein my thoughts shall daily sing your praise;
    And will erect an altar for the same,
    Which shall your virtues and your honour raise.
    But heaven the temple of your honour is,
    Whose brasen tops your worthy self made proud;
    The ground an altar, base for such a bliss
    With pity torn, because I sighed so loud.

RHYME a a b c b c d e d e f g f g h h 

    And since my skill no worship can impart,
    Make you an incense of my loving heart.
    Sad all alone not long I musing sat,
    But that my thoughts compelled me to aspire,
    A laurel garland in my hand I gat;
    So the Muses I approached the nigher.
    My suite was this, a poet to become,
    To drink with them, and from the heavens be fed.
    Phoebus denied, and sware there was no room,
    Such to be poets as fond fancy led.
    With that I mourned and sat me down to weep.
    Venus she smiled, and smiling to me said,
    "Come, drink with me, and sit thee still and sleep."
    This voice I heard; and Venus I obeyed.
    That poison sweet hath done me all this wrong,
    For now of love must needs be all my song.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Weary was love and sought to take his rest,
    He made his choice, upon a virgin's lap;
    And slyly crept from thence unto her breast,
    Where still he meant to sport him in his hap;
    The virgin frowned like Phoebus in a cloud;
    "Go pack, sir boy, here is no room for such,
    My breast no wanton foolish boy must shroud."
    This said, my love did give the wag a touch;
    Then as the foot that treads the stinging snake
    Hastes to be gone, for fear what may ensue,
    So love my love was forced for to forsake,
    And for more speed, without his arrows flew.
    "Pardon," he said, "For why? You seemed to me
    My mother Venus in her pride to be."

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    The heavens beheld the beauty of my queen,
    And all amazed, to wonder thus began:
    "Why dotes not Jove, as erst we all have seen,
    And shapes himself like to a seemly man?
    Mean are the matches which he sought before,
    Like bloomless buds, too base to make compare,
    And she alone hath treasured beauty's store,
    In whom all gifts and princely graces are."
    Cupid replied: "I posted with the sun
    To view the maids that lived in those days,
    And none there was that might not well be won,
    But she, most hard, most cold, made of delays."
      Heavens were deceived, and wrong they do esteem,
      She hath no heat, although she living seem.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Love and my love did range the forest wild,
    Mounted alike, upon swift coursers both.
    Love her encountered, though he was a child.
    "Let's strive," saith he, whereat my love was wroth,
    And scorned the boy, and checked him with a smile.
    "I mounted am, and armed with my spear;
    Thou art too weak, thyself do not beguile;
    I could thee conquer if I naked were."
    With this love wept, and then my love replied:
    "Kiss me, sweet boy, so weep my boy no more."
    Thus did my love, and then her force she tried;
    Love was made ice, that fire was before.
    A kiss of hers, as I, poor soul, do prove,
    Can make the hottest freeze and coldest love.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Love with her hair my love by force hath tied,
    To serve her lips, her eyes, her voice, her hand;
    I smiled for joy, when I the boy espied
    To lie unchained and live at her command.
    She if she look, or kiss, or sing, or smile,
    Cupid withal doth smile, doth sing, doth kiss,
    Lips, hands, voice, eyes, all hearts that may beguile,
    Because she scorns all hearts but only this.
    Venus for this in pride began to frown
    That Cupid, born a god, enthralled should be.
    She in disdain her pretty son threw down,
    And in his place, with love she chained me.
    So now, sweet love, though I myself be thrall,
    Not her a goddess, but thyself I call.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    My love amazed did blush herself to see,
    Pictured by art, all naked as she was.
    "How could the painter know so much by me,
    Or art effect what he hath brought to pass?
    It is not like he naked me hath seen,
    Or stood so nigh for to observe so much."
    No, sweet; his eyes so near have never been,
    Nor could his hands by art have cunning such;
    I showed my heart, wherein you printed were,
    You, naked you, as here you painted are;
    In that my love your picture I must wear,
    And show't to all, unless you have more care.
    Then take my heart, and place it with your own;
    So shall you naked never more be known.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Death in a rage assaulted once my heart
    With love of her, my love that doth deny.
    I scorned his force, and wished him to depart,
    I heartless was, and therefore could not die.
    I live in her, in her I placed my life,
    She guides my soul, and her I honour must.
    Nor is this life but yet a living strife,
    A thing unmeet, and yet a thing most just.
    Cupid enraged did fly to make me love,
    My heart lay guarded with those burning eyes
    The sparks whereof denied him to remove;
    So conquered now, he like a captive lies;
    Thus two at once by love were both undone,
    My heart not loved, and armless Venus' son.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Hard are the rocks, the marble, and the steel,
    The ancient oak with wind and weather tossed;
    But you, my love, far harder do I feel
    Than flint, or these, or is the winter's frost.
    My tears too weak, your heart they cannot move;
    My sighs, that rock, like wind it cannot rent;
    Too tiger-like you swear you cannot love;
    But tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent.
    The frost too hard, not melted with my flame,
    I cinders am, and yet you feel no heat.
    Surpass not these, sweet love, for very shame,
    But let my tears, my vows, my sighs entreat;
    Then shall I say as by trial find;
    These all are hard, but you, my love, are kind.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Love was laid down, all weary fast asleep,
    Whereas my love his armor took away;
    The boy awaked, and straight began to weep,
    But stood amazed, and knew not what to say.
    "Weep not, my boy," said Venus to her son,
    "Thy weapons none can wield, but thou alone;
    Licia the fair, this harm to thee hath done,
    I saw her here, and presently was gone;
    She will restore them, for she hath no need
    To take thy weapons where thy valour lies;
    For men to wound the Fates have her decreed,
    With favour, hands, with beauty, and with eyes."
    No, Venus, no: she scorns them, credit me;
    But robbed thy son that none might care for thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    A painter drew the image of the boy,
    Swift love, with wings all naked, and yet blind;
    With bow and arrows, bent for to destroy;
    I blamed his skill, and fault I thus did find:
    "A needless task I see thy cunning take;
    Misled by love, thy fancy thee betrayed;
    Love is no boy, nor blind, as men him make,
    Nor weapons wears, whereof to be affrayed;
    But if thou, love, wilt paint with greatest skill
    A love, a maid, a goddess, and a queen;
    Wonder and view at Licia's picture still,
    For other love the world hath never seen;
    For she alone all hope all comfort gives;
    Men's hearts, souls, all, led by her favour lives."

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    In Ida vale three queens the shepherd saw,
    Queens of esteem, divine they were all three,
    A sight of worth. But I a wonder shaw,
    Their virtues all in one alone to be.
    Licia the fair, surpassing Venus' pride,
    (The matchless queen, commander of the gods,
    When drawn with doves she in her pomp doth ride)
    Hath far more beauty, and more grace by odds
    Juno, Jove's wife, unmeet to make compare,
    I grant a goddess, but not half so mild;
    Minerva wise, a virtue, but not rare;
    Yet these are mean, if that my love but smiled.
      She them surpasseth, when their prides are full
      As far as they surpass the meanest trull.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I wish sometimes, although a worthless thing,
    Spurred by ambition, glad to aspire,
    Myself a monarch, or some mighty king,
    And then my thoughts do wish for to be higher.
    But when I view what winds the cedars toss,
    What storms men feels that covet for renown,
    I blame myself that I have wished my loss,
    And scorn a kingdom, though it give a crown.
    Ah Licia, though the wonder of my thought,
    My heart's content, procurer of my bliss,
    For whom a crown I do esteem as naught,
    As Asia's wealth, too mean to buy a kiss!
      Kiss me, sweet love, this favor do for me;
      Then crowns and kingdoms shall I scorn for thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Enamored Jove commanding did entreat
    Cupid to wound my love, which he denied,
    And swore he could not for she wanted heat
    And would not love, as he full oft had tried.
    Jove in a rage, impatient this to hear,
    Replied with threats; "I'll make you to obey!"
    Whereat the boy did fly away for fear
    To Licia's eyes, where safe intrenched he lay.
    Then Jove he scorned, and dared him to his face,
    For now more safe than in the heavens he dwelled,
    Nor could Jove's wrath do wrong to such a place
    Where grace and honour have their kingdom held.
      Thus in the pride and beauty of her eyes
      The seely boy the greatest god defies.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    My love lay sleeping, where birds music made,
    Shutting her eyes, disdainful of the light;
    The heat was great but greater was the shade
    Which her defended from his burning sight.
    This Cupid saw, and came a kiss to take,
    Sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath;
    She felt the touch, and blushed, and did awake,
    Seeing t'was love, which she did think was death,
    She cut his wings and caused him to stay,
    Making a vow, he should not thence depart,
    Unless to her the wanton boy could pay
    The truest, kindest and most loving heart.
      His feathers still she used for a fan,
      Till by exchange my heart his feathers won.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I stood amazed, and saw my Licia shine,
    Fairer than Phoebus, in his brightest pride,
    Set forth in colors by a hand divine,
    Where naught was wanting but a soul to guide.
    It was a picture, that I could descry,
    Yet made with art so as it seemed to live,
    Surpassing fair, and yet it had no eye,
    Whereof my senses could no reason give.
    With that the painter bid me not to muse;
    "Her eyes are shut, but I deserve no blame;
    For if she saw, in faith, it could not choose
    But that the work had wholly been a flame,"--
      Then burn me, sweet, with brightness of your eyes,
      That phoenix-like from thence I may arise.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Grant, fairest kind, a kiss unto thy friend!
    A blush replied, and yet a kiss I had.
    It is not heaven that can such nectar send
    Whereat my senses all amazed were glad.
    This done, she fled as one that was affrayed,
    And I desired to kiss by kissing more;
    My love she frowned, and I my kissing stayed,
    Yet wished to kiss her as I did before.
    Then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp,
    Loath to depart till both together die,
    So fold me, sweet, until my latest gasp,
    That in thy arms to death I kissed may lie.
      Thus whilst I live for kisses I must call;
      Still kiss me, sweet, or kiss me not at all.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    As are the sands, fair Licia, on the shore,
    Or colored flowers, garlands of the spring,
    Or as the frosts not seen, not felt before,
    Or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring;
    As twinkling stars, the tinsel of the night,
    Or as the fish that gallop in the seas;
    As airs each part that still escapes our sight,
    So are my sighs, controllers of my ease.
    Yet these are such as needs must have an end,
    For things finite none else hath nature done;
    Only the sighs, which from my heart I send,
    Will never cease, but where they first begun.
      Accept them, sweet, as incense due to thee;
      For you immortal made them so to be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I swear, fair Licia, still for to be thine,
    By heart, by eyes, by what I held most dear;
    Thou checked mine oath, and said: these were not mine,
    And that I had no right by them to swear.
    Then by my sighs, my passions, and my tears,
    My vows, my prayers, my sorrow, and my love,
    My grief, my joy, my hope, and hopeless fears,
    My heart is thine, and never shall remove.
    These are not thine, though sent unto thy view,
    All else I grant, by right they are thine own;
    Let these suffice that what I swear is true,
    And more than this if that it could be known.
      So shall all these though troubles ease my grief;
      If that they serve to work in thee belief.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    That time, fair Licia, when I stole a kiss,
    From off those lips, where Cupid lovely laid,
    I quaked for cold, and found the cause was this:
    My life which loved, for love behind me staid.
    I sent my heart my life for to recall,
    But that was held, not able to return,
    And both detained as captives were in thrall,
    And judged by her, that both by sighs should burn.
    Fair, burn them both, for that they were so bold,
    But let the altar be within thy heart;
    And I shall live because my life you hold,
    You that give life, to every living part;
      A flame I took whenas I stole the kiss;
      Take you my life, yet can I live with this.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    First did I fear, when first my love began;
    Possessed in fits by watchful jealousy,
    I sought to keep what I by favour won,
    And brooked no partner in my love to be.
    But tyrant sickness fed upon my love,
    And spread his ensigns, dyed with colour white;
    Then was suspicion glad for to remove,
    And loving much did fear to lose her quite.
    Erect, fair sweet, the colors thou didst wear;
    Dislodge thy griefs; the short'ners of content;
    For now of life, not love, is all my fear,
    Lest life and love be both together spent.
      Live but, fair love, and banish thy disease,
      And love, kind heart, both where and whom thou please.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Licia my love was sitting in a grove,
    Tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs,
    But straight she spied where two together strove,
    Each one complaining of the other's wrongs.
    Cupid did cry lamenting of the harm;
    Jove's messenger, thou wrong'st me too too far;
    Use thou thy rod, rely upon the charm;
    Think not by speech my force thou canst debar.
    A rod, Sir boy, were fitter for a child,
    My weapons oft and tongue and mind you took;
    And in my wrong at my distress thou smiled,
    And scorned to grace me with a loving look.
      Speak you, sweet love, for you did all the wrong
      That broke his arrows, and did bind his tongue.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I might have died before my life begun,
    Whenas my father for his country's good
    The Persian's favor and the Sophy won
    And yet with danger of his dearest blood.
    Thy father, sweet, whom danger did beset,
    Escaped all, and for no other end
    But only this, that you he might beget,
    Whom heavens decreed into the world to send.
    Then father, thank thy daughter for thy life,
    And Neptune praise that yielded so to thee,
    To calm the tempest when the storms were rife,
    And that thy daughter should a Venus be.
    I call thee Venus, sweet, but be not wroth;
    Thou art more chaste, yet seas did favor both.

    My love was masked, and armed with a fan,
    To see the sun so careless of his light,
    Which stood and gazed, and gazing waxed wan
    To see a star himself that was more bright.
    Some did surmize she hid her from the sun,
    Of whom in pride she scorned for to be kissed,
    Or feared the harm by him to others done.
    But these the reason of this wonder missed,
    Nor durst the sun, if that her face were bare
    In greatest pride, presume to take a kiss.
    But she more kind did show she had more care
    Than with her eyes eclipse him of his bliss.
      Unmask you, sweet, and spare not; dim the sun;
      Your light's enough, although that his were done.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Whenas my love lay sickly in her bed,
    Pale death did post in hope to have a prey;
    But she so spotless made him that he fled;
    "Unmeet to die," she cried, and could not stay.
    Back he retired, and thus the heavens he told;
    "All things that are, are subject unto me,
    Both towns, and men, and what the world doth hold;
    But her fair Licia still immortal be."
    The heavens did grant; a goddess she was made,
    Immortal, fair, unfit to suffer change.
    So now she lives, and never more shall fade;
    In earth a goddess, what can be more strange?
      Then will I hope, a goddess and so near,
      She cannot choose my sighs and prayers but hear.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g h g h i i 

    Seven are the lights that wander in the skies,
    And at these seven, I wonder in my love.
    So see the moon, how pale she doth arise,
    Standing amazed, as though she durst not move;
    So is my sweet much paler than the snow,
    Constant her looks, these looks that cannot change.
    Mercury the next, a god sweet-tongued we know,
    But her sweet voice doth wonders speak more strange.
    The rising Sun doth boast him of his pride,
    And yet my love is far more fair than he.
    The warlike Mars can wieldless weapons guide,
    But yet that god is far more weak than she.
    The lovely Venus seemeth to be fair,
    But at her best my love is far more bright.
    Saturn for age with groans doth dim the air,
    Whereas my love with smiles doth give it light.
      Gaze at her brows, where heaven ingrafted is;
      Then sigh, and swear, there is no heaven but this.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I live, sweet love, whereas the gentle wind
    Murmurs with sport in midst of thickest boughs,
    Where loving woodbine doth the harbor bind,
    And chirping birds do echo forth my vows;
    Where strongest elm can scarce support the vine,
    And sweetest flowers enameled have the ground;
    Where Muses dwell; and yet hereat repine
    That on the earth so rare a place was found.
    But winds delight, I wish to be content;
    I praise the woodbine, but I take no joy;
    I moan the birds that music thus have spent;
    As for the rest, they breed but mine annoy.
      Live then, fair Licia, in this place alone;
      Then shall I joy though all of these were gone.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    The crystal stream wherein my love did swim,
    Melted in tears as partners of my woe;
    Her shine was such as did the fountain dim,
    The pearl-like fountain whiter than the snow;
    Then like perfume, resolved with a heat,
    The fountain smoked, as if it thought to burn;
    A wonder strange to see the cold so great,
    And yet the fountain into smoke to turn.
    I searched the cause, and found it to be this:
    She touched the water, and it burned with love.
    Now by her means it purchased hath that bliss,
    Which all diseases quickly can remove.
      Then if by you these streams thus blessed be,
      Sweet, grant me love, and be not worse to me.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    In time the strong and stately turrets fall,
    In time the rose and silver lilies die,
    In time the monarchs captive are and thrall,
    In time the sea and rivers are made dry;
    The hardest flint in time doth melt asunder;
    Still living fame in time doth fade away;
    The mountains proud we see in time come under;
    And earth for age we see in time decay;
    The sun in time forgets for to retire
    From out the east where he was wont to rise;
    The basest thoughts we see in time aspire,
    And greedy minds in time do wealth despise.
      Thus all, sweet fair, in time must have an end,
      Except thy beauty, virtues, and thy friend.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Why died I not whenas I last did sleep?
    O sleep too short that shadowed forth my dear!
    Heavens, hear my prayers, nor thus me waking keep!
    For this were heaven, if thus I sleeping were.
    For in that dark there shone a princely light;
    Two milk-white hills, both full of nectar sweet,
    Her ebon thighs, the wonder of my sight,
    Where all my senses with their objects meet,--
    I pass these sports, in secret that are best,
    Wherein my thoughts did seem alive to be;
    We both did strive, and weary both did rest;
    I kissed her still, and still she kissed me.
      Heavens, let me sleep, and shows my senses feed,
      Or let me wake and happy be indeed!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Whenas my Licia sailed in the seas,
    Viewing with pride god Neptune's stately crown,
    A calm she made, and brought the merchant ease,
    The storm she stayed, and checked him with a frown.
    Love at the stern sate smiling and did sing
    To see how seas had learned for to obey;
    And balls of fire into the waves did fling;
    And still the boy full wanton thus did say:--
    "Both poles we burnt whereon the world doth turn,
    The round of heaven from earth unto the skies;
    And now the seas we both intend to burn,
    I with my bow, and Licia with her eyes."
      Then since thy force, heavens, earth, nor seas can move,
      I conquered yield, and do confess I love.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Whenas her lute is tuned to her voice,
    The air grows proud for honour of that sound,
    And rocks do leap to show how they rejoice
    That in the earth such music should be found.
    Whenas her hair more worth, more pale than gold,
    Like silver thread lies wafting in the air,
    Diana-like she looks, but yet more bold;
    Cruel in chase, more chaste and yet more fair.
    Whenas she smiles, the clouds for envy breaks;
    She Jove in pride encounters with a check;
    The sun doth shine for joy whenas she speaks;
    Thus heaven and earth do homage at her beck.
      Yet all these graces, blots, not graces are,
      If you, my love, of love do take no care.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Years, months, days, hours, in sighs I sadly spend;
    I black the night wherein I sleepless toss;
    I love my griefs yet wish them at an end;
    Thus time's expense increaseth but my loss.
    I musing stand and wonder at my love,
    That in so fair should be a heart of steel;
    And then I think my fancy to remove,
    But then more painful I my passions feel;
    Thus must I love, sweet fair, until I die,
    And your unkindness doth my love increase.
    I conquered am, I can it not deny;
    My life must end, yet shall my love not cease.
      Then heavens, make Licia fair most kind to me,
      Or with my life my loss may finished be!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I wrote my sighs, and sent them to my love;
    I praised that fair that none enough could praise;
    But plaints nor praises could fair Licia move;
    Above my reach she did her virtues raise,
    And thus replied: "False Scrawl, untrue thou art,
    To feign those sighs that nowhere can be found;
    For half those praises came not from his heart
    Whose faith and love as yet was never found.
    Thy master's life, false Scrawl shall be thy doom;
    Because he burns, I judge thee to the flame;
    Both your attempts deserve no better room."
    Thus at her word we ashes both became.
      Believe me, fair, and let my paper live;
      Or be not fair, and so me freedom give.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Pale are my looks, forsaken of my life,
    Cinders my bones, consumed with thy flame,
    Floods are my tears, to end this burning strife,
    And yet I sigh for to increase the same;
    I mourn alone because alone I burn;
    Who doubts of this, then let him learn to love;
    Her looks cold ice into a flame can turn,
    As I distressed in myself do prove.
    Respect, fair Licia, what my torments are;
    Count but the tithe both of my sighs and tears;
    See how my love doth still increase my care,
    And care's increase my life to nothing wears.
      Send but a sigh my flame for to increase,
      Or lend a tear and cause it so to cease.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Whenas I wish, fair Licia, for a kiss
    From those sweet lips where rose and lilies strive,
    Straight do mine eyes repine at such a bliss,
    And seek my lips thereof for to deprive;
    Whenas I seek to glut mine eyes by sight,
    My lips repine and call mine eyes away;
    Thus both contend to have each other's right,
    And both conspire to work my full decay.
    O force admired of beauty in her pride,
    In whose each part such strange effects there be,
    That all my forces in themselves divide,
    And make my senses plainly disagree.
      If all were mine, this envy would be gone;
      Then grant me all, fair sweet, or grant me none!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Hear how my sighs are echoed of the wind;
    See how my tears are pitied by the rain;
    Feel what a flame possessed hath my mind;
    Taste but the grief which I possess in vain.
    Then if my sighs the blustering winds surpass,
    And wat'ry tears the drops of rain exceed,
    And if no flame like mine nor is nor was,
    Nor grief like that whereon my soul doth feed,
    Relent, fair Licia, when my sighs do blow;
    Yield at my tears, that flintlike drops consume;
    Accept the flame that doth my incense show,
    Allow the grief that is my heart's perfume.
      Thus sighs and tears, flame, grief shall plead for me;
      So shall I pray, and you a goddess be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I speak, fair Licia, what my torments be,
    But then my speech too partial do I find;
    For hardly words can with those thoughts agree,
    Those thoughts that swarm in such a troubled mind.
    Then do I vow my tongue shall never speak
    Nor tell my grief that in my heart doth lie;
    But cannon-like, I then surcharged do break,
    And so my silence worse than speech I try.
    Thus speech or none, they both do breed my care;
    I live dismayed, and kill my heart with grief;
    In all respects my case alike doth fare
    To him that wants, and dare not ask relief.
      Then you, fair Lucia, sovereign of my heart,
      Read to yourself my anguish and my smart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Sweet, I protest, and seal it with an oath:
    I never saw that so my thoughts did please;
    And yet content displeased I see them wroth
    To love so much and cannot have their ease.
    I told my thoughts, my sovereign made a pause,
    Disposed to grant, but willing to delay;
    They then repined, for that they knew no cause,
    And swore they wished she flatly would say nay.
    Thus hath my love, my thoughts with treason filled,
    And 'gainst my sovereign taught them to repine.
    So thus my treason all my thoughts hath killed,
    And made fair Licia say she is not mine.
      But thoughts too rash my heart doth now repent;
      And as you please, they swear, they are content.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Fair matchless nymph, respect but what I crave;
    My thoughts are true, and honour is my love;
    I fainting die whom yet a smile might save;
    You gave the wound, and can the hurt remove.
    Those eyes like stars that twinkle in the night,
    And cheeks like rubies pale in lilies dyed,
    Those ebon hands that darting hath such might
    That _in_ my soul my love and life divide,
    Accept the passions of a man possessed;
    Let love be loved and grant me leave to live;
    Disperse those clouds that darkened have my rest,
    And let your heaven a sun-like smile but give!
      Then shall I praise that heaven for such a sun
      That saved my life, whenas my grief begun.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    My grief begun, fair saint, when first I saw
    Love in those eyes sit ruling with disdain,
    Whose sweet commands did keep a world in awe,
    And caused them serve your favor to obtain.
    I stood as one enchanted with a frown,
    Yet smiled to see all creatures serve those eyes,
    Where each with sighs paid tribute to that crown,
    And thought them graced by your dumb replies.
    But I, ambitious, could not be content
    Till that my service more than sighs made known;
    And for that end my heart to you I sent
    To say and swear that, fair, it is your own.
      Then greater graces, Licia, do impart,
      Not dumb replies unto a speaking heart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Poets did feign that heavens a Venus had,
    Matchless herself, and Cupid was her son;
    Men sued to these, and of their smiles were glad,
    By whom so many famous were undone.
    Now Cupid mourns that he hath lost his might,
    And that these two so comely are to see;
    And Venus frowns because they have her right.
    Yet both so like that both shall blameless be;
    With heaven's two twins for godhead these may strive,
    And rule a world with least part of a frown;
    Fairer than these two twins are not alive,
    Both conquering queens, and both deserve a crown.
      My thoughts presage, which time to come shall try,
      That thousands conquered for their love shall die.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    If, aged Charon, when my life shall end,
    I pass thy ferry and my waftage pay,
    Thy oars shall fall, thy boat and mast shall rend,
    And through the deep shall be a dry foot-way.
    For why? My heart with sighs doth breathe such flame
    That air and water both incensed be,
    The boundless ocean from whose mouth they came,
    For from my heat not heaven itself is free.
    Then since to me thy loss can be no gain,
    Avoid thy harm and fly what I foretell.
    Make thou thy love with me for to be slain,
    That I with her and both with thee may dwell.
      Thy fact thus, Charon, both of us shall bless,
      Thou save thy boat and I my love possess.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    For if alone thou think to waft my love,
    Her cold is such as can the sea command,
    And frozen ice shall let thy boat to move,
    Nor can thy forces row it from the land.
    But if thou friendly both at once shalt take,
    Thyself mayst rest. For why? My sighs will blow.
    Our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make,
    As that thy boat without thy help shall row.
    Then will I sit and glut me on those eyes
    Wherewith my life my eyes could never fill.
    Thus from my boat that comfort shall arise,
    The want whereof my life and hope did kill.
      Together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross,
      Where if we part thy boat must suffer loss.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Are those two stars, her eyes, my life's light gone,
    By which my soul was freed from all dark?
    And am I left distressed to live alone,
    Where none my tears and mournful tale shall mark?
    Ah sun, why shine thy looks, thy looks like gold,
    When horsemen brave thou risest in the east?
    Ah Cynthia pale, to whom my griefs I told,
    Why do you both rejoice both man and beast?
    And I alone, alone that dark possess
    By Licia's absence brighter than the sun,
    Whose smiling light did ease my sad distress,
    And broke the clouds, when tears like rain begun.
      Heavens, grant that light and so me waking keep,
      Or shut my eyes and rock me fast asleep!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Cruel fair love, I justly do complain
    Of too much rigor and thy heart unkind,
    That for mine eyes thou hast my body slain,
    And would not grant that I should favour find.
    I looked, fair love, and you my love looked fair,
    I sighed for love and you for sport did smile.
    Your smiles were such as did perfume the air,
    And this perfumed did my heart beguile.
    Thus I confess the fault was in mine eyes,
    Begun with sighs and ended with a flame.
    I for your love did all the world despise;
    And in these poems honored have your name.
      Then let your love so with my fault dispense,
      That all my parts feel not mine eyes' offense.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    There shone a comet, and it was full west.
    My thoughts presaged what it did portend;
    I found it threatened to my heart unrest,
    And might in time my joys and comfort end.
    I further sought and found it was a sun,
    Which day nor night did never use to set.
    It constant stood when heavens did restless run,
    And did their virtues and their forces let.
    The world did muse and wonder what it meant,
      A sun to shine and in the west to rise;
    To search the truth, I strength and spirits spent;
      At length I found it was my Licia's eyes.
    Now never after soul shall live in dark,
    That hath the hap this western sun to mark.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    If he be dead, in whom no heart remains,
    Or lifeless be in whom no life is found;
    If he do pine that never comfort gains,
    And be distressed that hath his deadly wound;
    Then must I die whose heart elsewhere is clad,
    And lifeless pass the greedy worms to feed;
    Then must I pine that never comfort had,
    And be distressed whose wound with tears doth bleed.
    Which if I do, why do I not wax cold?
    Why rest I not like one that wants a heart?
    Why move I still like him that life doth hold,
    And sense enjoy both of my joy and smart?
    Like Niobe queen which made a stone did weep,
    Licia my heart dead and alive doth keep.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Like Memnon's rock, touched with the rising sun
    Which yields a sound and echoes forth a voice,
    But when it's drowned in western seas is done,
    And drowsy-like leaves off to make a noise;
    So I, my love, enlightened with your shine,
    A poet's skill within my soul I shroud,
    Not rude like that which finer wits decline,
    But such as Muses to the best allowed.
    But when your figure and your shape is gone
    I speechless am like as I was before;
    Or if I write, my verse is filled with moan,
    And blurred with tears by falling in such store.
      Then muse not, Licia, if my Muse be slack,
      For when I wrote I did thy beauty lack.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    I saw, sweet Licia, when the spider ran
    Within your house to weave a worthless web,
    You present were and feared her with your fan,
    So that amazed speedily she fled.
    She in your house such sweet perfumes did smell,
    And heard the Muses with their notes refined,
    Thus filled with envy, could no longer dwell,
    But straight returned and at your house repined.
    Then tell me, spider, why of late I saw
    Thee lose thy poison, and thy bowels gone;
    Did these enchant and keep thy limbs in awe,
    And made thy forces to be small or none?
      No, no, thou didst by chance my Licia see,
      Who for her look Minerva seemed to thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    If that I die, fair Licia, with disdain,
    Or heartless live surprised with thy wrong,
    Then heavens and earth shall accent both my pain,
    And curse the time so cruel and so long.
    If you be kind, my queen, as you are fair,
    And aid my thoughts that still for conquest strive,
    Then will I sing and never more despair,
    And praise your kindness whilst I am alive.
    Till then I pay the tribute of my tears,
    To move thy mercy and thy constant truth.
    Respect, fair love, how these with sorrow wears
    The truest heart unless it find some ruth.
      Then grace me, sweet, and with thy favor raise me,
      So shall I live and all the world shall praise thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Ah Licia, sigh and say thou art my own;
    Nay, be my own, as you full oft have said.
    So shall your truth unto the world be known,
    And I resolved where now I am afraid.
    And if my tongue eternize can your praise,
    Or silly speech increase your worthy fame,
    If ought I can, to heaven your worth can raise,
    The age to come shall wonder at the same.
    In this respect your love, sweet love, I told,
    My faith and truth I vowed should be forever.
    You were the cause if that I was too bold;
    Then pardon this my fault or love me never.
      But if you frown I wish that none believe me,
      For slain with sighs I'll die before I grieve thee.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    When first the sun whom all my senses serve,
    Began to shine upon this earthly round,
    The heavens for her all graces did reserve,
    That Pandor-like with all she might abound.
    Apollo placed his brightness in her eyes,
    His skill presaging and his music sweet.
    Mars gave his force; all force she now defies;
    Venus her smiles wherewith she Mars did meet;
    Python a voice, Diana made her chaste,
    Ceres gave plenty, Cupid lent his bow,
    Thetis his feet, there Pallas wisdom placed.
    With these she queen-like kept a world in awe.
      Yet all these honors deemed are but pelf,
      For she is much more worthy of herself.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    O sugared talk, wherewith my thoughts do live!
    O brows, love's trophy and my senses' shine!
    O charming smiles, that death or life can give!
    O heavenly kisses from a mouth divine!
    O wreaths too strong, and trammels made of hair!
    O pearls inclosed in an ebon pale!
    O rose and lilies in a field most fair,
    Where modest white doth make the red seem pale!
    O voice whose accents live within my heart!
    O heavenly hand that more than Atlas holds!
    O sighs perfumed, that can release my smart!
    O happy they whom in her arms she folds!
      Now if you ask where dwelleth all this bliss,
      Seek out my love and she will tell you this.

RHYME a a *

    Love, I repent me that I thought
    My sighs and languish dearly bought.
    For sighs and languish both did prove
    That he that languished sighed for love.
    Cruel rigor, foe to state,
    Looks disdainful, fraught with hate,
    I did blame, but had no cause;
    Love hath eyes, but hath no laws.
    She was sad and could not choose
    To see me sigh and sit and muse.
    We both did love and both did doubt
    Least any should our love find out.
    Our hearts did speak, by sighs most hidden;
    This means was left, all else forbidden.
    I did frown her love to try,
    She did sigh and straight did cry.
    Both of us did sighs believe,
    Yet either grieved friend to grieve.
    I did look and then did smile;
    She left sighing all that while.
    Both were glad to see that change,
    Things in love that are not strange.
    Suspicion, foolish foe to reason,
    Caused me seek to find some treason.
    I did court another dame,
    False in love, it is a shame!--
    She was sorry this to view,
    Thinking faith was proved untrue.
    Then she swore she would not love
    One whom false she once did prove.
 
RHYME a a *

   I did vow I never meant
    From promise made for to relent.
    The more I said the worse she thought,
    My oaths and vows were deemed as naught.
    "False," she said "how can it be,
    To court another yet love me?
    Crowns and love no partners brook;
    If she be liked I am forsook.
    Farewell, false, and love her still,
    Your chance was good, but mine was ill.

RHYME a a *

    No harm to you, but this I crave,
    That your new love may you deceive,
    And jest with you as you have done,
    For light's the love that quickly won."
    "Kind, and fair-sweet, once believe me;
    Jest I did but not to grieve thee.
    Court I did, but did not love;
    All my speech was you to prove.
    Words and sighs and what I spent,
    In show to her, to you were meant.
    Fond I was your love to cross;
    Jesting love oft brings this loss.
    Forget this fault, and love your friend,
    Which vows his truth unto the end."
    "Content," she said, "if this you keep."
    Thus both did kiss, and both did weep.
    For women long they cannot chide,
    As I by proof in this have tried.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    The sea-nymphs late did play them on the shore,
    And smiled to see such sport was new begun,
    A strife in love, the like not heard before,
    Two nymphs contend which had the conquest won.
    Doris the fair with Galate did chide;
    She liked her choice, and to her taunts replied.

RHYME a b a b 

    Thy love, fair nymph, that courts thee on this plain,
    As shepherds say and all the world can tell,
    Is that foul rude Sicilian Cyclop-swain;
    A shame, sweet nymph, that he with thee should mell.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Smile not, fair Doris, though he foul do seem,
    Let pass thy words that savour of disgrace;
    He's worth my love, and so I him esteem,
    Renowned by birth, and come of Neptune's race,
    Neptune that doth the glassy ocean tame,
    Neptune, by birth from mighty Jove which came.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

    I grant an honour to be Neptune's child,
    A grace to be so near with Jove allied.
    But yet, sweet nymph, with this be not beguiled;
    Where nature's graces are by looks decried,
    So foul, so rough, so ugly as a clown,
    And worse than this, a monster with one eye!
    Foul is not graced, though it wear a crown,
    But fair is beauty, none can that deny.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

    Nor is he foul or shapeless as you say,
    Or worse; for that he clownish seems to be,
    Rough, satyr-like, the better he will play,
    And manly looks the fitter are for me.
    His frowning smiles are graced by his beard,
    His eye-light, sun-like, shrouded is in one.
    This me contents, and others make afeard.
    He sees enough, and therefore wanteth none.

RHYME a b a b 

    Nay, then I see, sweet nymph, thou art in love,
    And loving, dotes; and doting, dost commend
    Foul to be fair; this oft do lovers prove;
    I wish him fairer, or thy love an end.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e e 

    Doris, I love not, yet I hardly bear
    Disgraceful terms, which you have spoke in scorn.
    You are not loved; and that's the cause I fear;
    For why? My love of Jove himself was born.
    Feeding his sheep of late amidst this plain,
    Whenas we nymphs did sport us on the shore,
    He scorned you all, my love for to obtain;
    That grieved your hearts; I knew as much before.
    Nay, smile not, nymphs, the truth I only tell,
    For few can brook that others should excel.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Should I envy that blind did you that spite?
    Or that your shape doth please so foul a groom?
    The shepherd thought of milk, you looked so white;
    The clown did err, and foolish was his doom.
      Your look was pale, and so his stomach fed;
      But far from fair, where white doth want his red.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Though pale my look, yet he my love did crave,
    And lovely you, unliked, unloved I view;
    It's better far one base than none to have;
    Your fair is foul, to whom there's none will sue.
      My love doth tune his love unto his harp.
      His shape is rude, but yet his wit is sharp.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Leave off, sweet nymph, to grace a worthless clown.
    He itched with love, and then did sing or say;
    The noise was such as all the nymphs did frown,
    And well suspected that some ass did bray.
    The woods did chide to hear this ugly sound
    The prating echo scorned for to repeat;
    This grisly voice did fear the hollow ground,
    Whilst artless fingers did his harpstrings beat.
    Two bear-whelps in his arms this monster bore,
    With these new puppies did this wanton play;
    Their skins was rough but yet your loves was more;
    He fouler was and far more fierce than they.
    I cannot choose, sweet nymph, to think, but smile
    That some of us thou fear'st will thee beguile.

RHYME a a 

    Scorn not my love, until it can be known
    That you have one that's better of your own.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

    I have no love, nor if I had, would boast;
    Yet wooed have been by such as well might speed:
    But him to love, the shame of all the coast,
    So ugly foul, as yet I have no need.
      Now thus we learn what foolish love can do,
      To think him fair that's foul and ugly too.
    To hear this talk, I sat behind an oak,
    And marked their words and penned them as they spoke.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    True are my thoughts, my thoughts that are untrue,
    Blind are my eyes, my eyes that are not blind,
    New is my love, my love that is not new,
    Kind is that fair, that fair that is not kind.
      Thus eyes and thoughts, that fairest fair, my love,
      Blind and untrue, unkind, unconstant prove.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    True are my thoughts because they never flit,
    Untrue my thoughts because they me betrayed;
    Blind are my eyes because in clouds I sit,
    Not blind my eyes because I looks obeyed.
      Thus eyes and thoughts, my dearest fair may view
      In sight, in love, not blind, nor yet untrue.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    New is my love because it never dies,
    Old is my love because it ever lives;
    Kind is that fair because it hate denies,
    Unkind that fair because no hope it gives.
      Thus new my love, and still that fair unkind,
      Renews my love, and I no favour find.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Sweet are my dreams, my dreams that are not sweet,
    Long are the nights, the nights that are not long,
    Meet are the pangs, these pangs that are unmeet,
    Wronged is my heart, my heart that hath no wrong.
      Thus dreams, and night, my heart, my pangs, and all
      In taste, in length, conspire to work my fall.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Sweet are my dreams because my love they show,
    Unsweet my dreams because but dreams they are;
    Long are the nights because no help I know,
    Meet are the nights because they end my care.
      Thus dreams and nights wherein my love take sport,
      Are sweet, unsweet, are long, and yet too short.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Meet are my pangs because I was too bold,
    Unmeet my pangs because I loved so well;
    Wronged was my heart because my grief it told,
    Not wronged. For why? My grief it could not tell.
      Thus you my love unkindly cause this smart,
      That will not love to ease my pangs and heart.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Proud is her look, her look that is not proud,
    Done all my days, my days that are not done,
    Loud are my sighs, my sighs that are not loud,
    Begun my death, my death not yet begun.
      Thus looks and days and sighs and death might move
      So kind, so fair, to give consent to love.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Proud is her look because she scorns to see,
    Not proud her look for none dare say so much;
    Done are my days because they hapless be,
    Not done my days because I wish them such.
      Thus looks and days increase this loving strife.
      Not proud, nor done, nor dead, nor giving life.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Loud are my sighs because they pierce the sky,
    Not loud my sighs because they are not heard;
    My death begun because I artless cry,
    But not begun because I am debarred.
      Thus sighs and death my heart no comfort give;
      Both life deny, and both do make me live.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Bold are her smiles, her smiles that are not bold,
    Wise are her words, those words that are not wise,
    Cold are her lips, those lips that are not cold,
    Ice are those hands, those hands that are not ice.
      Thus smiles and words, her lips, her hands, and she,
      Bold, wise, cold, ice, love's cruel torments be.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Bold are her smiles, because they anger slay,
    Not bold her smiles because they blush so oft;
    Wise are her words because they wonders say,
    Not wise her words because they are not soft.
      Thus smiles and words, so cruel and so bold,
      So blushing wise, my thoughts in prison hold.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Cold are her lips because they breathe no heat,
    Not cold her lips because my heart they burn;
    Ice are her hands because the snow's so great,
    Not ice her hands that all to ashes turn.
      Thus lips and hands cold ice my sorrow brew;
      Hands, warm white snow and lips cold cherry-red.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Small was her waist, the waist that was not small,
    Gold was her hair, the hair that was not gold,
    Tall was her shape, the shape that was not tall;
    Folding the arms, the arms that did not fold.
      Thus hair and shape, those folding arms and waist,
      Did make me love, and loving made me waste.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Small was her waist, because I could it span,
    Not small her waist because she wanted all;
    Gold was her hair because a crown it wan,
    Not gold her hair because it was more pale.
      Thus smallest waist, the greatest waste doth make,
      And finest hair most fast a lover take.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Tall was her shape because she touched the sky,
    Not tall her shape because she comely was;
    Folding her arms because she hearts could tie,
    Not folded arms because all bands they pass.
      Thus shape and arms with love my heart did ply,
      That hers I am, and must be till I die.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Sad was her joy, her joy that was not sad,
    Short was her stay, her stay that was not short,
    Glad was her speech, her speech that was not glad,
    Sporting those toys, those toys that were not sport.
      Thus was my heart with joy, speech, toys and stay,
      Possessed with love, and so stol'n quite away.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Sad was her joy because she did respect,
    Not sad her joy because her joy she had,
    Short was her stay because to small effect,
    Long was her stay because I was so sad.
      Thus joy and stay, both crossed a lover's sport,
      The one was sad, the other too too short.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Glad was her speech because she spake her mind,
    Not glad her speech because afraid to speak;
    Sporting her toys because my love was kind,
    Not toys in sport because my heart they break.
      Thus speech and toys my love began in jest;
      Sweet, yield to love, and make thy servant blest.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Tread you the maze, sweet love, that I have run,
    Mark but the steps which I imprinted have;
    End but your love whereas my thoughts begun;
    So shall I joy and you a servant have.
      If not, sweet love, then this my suit deny;
      So shall you live, and so your servant die.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Down in a bed and on a bed of down,
    Love, she, and I to sleep together lay;
    She like a wanton kissed me with a frown,
    Sleep, sleep, she said, but meant to steal away;
      I could not choose but kiss, but wake, but smile,
      To see how she thought us two to beguile.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    She feigned a sleep, I waked her with a kiss;
    A kiss to me she gave to make me sleep;
    If I did wrong, sweet love, my fault was this,
    In that I did not you thus waking keep.
      "Then kiss me, sweet, that so I sleep may take,
      Or let me kiss to keep you still awake."

RHYME a b a b c c 

    The night drew on and needs she must be gone;
    She waked Love, and bid him learn to wait;
    She sighed, she said, to leave me there alone,
    And bid Love stay but practise no deceit.
      Love wept for grief, and sighing made great moan,
      And could not sleep nor stay if she were gone.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    "Then stay, sweet love;" a kiss with that I gave;
    She could not stay, but gave my kiss again;
    A kiss was all that I could get or crave,
    And with a kiss she bound me to remain.
      "Ah Licia," still I in my dreams did cry,
      "Come, Licia, come, or else my heart will die."

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Distance of place my love and me did part,
    Yet both did swear we never would remove;
    In sign thereof I bid her take my heart,
    Which did, and doth, and can not choose but love.
      Thus did we part in hope to meet again,
      Where both did vow most constant to remain.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    A she there was that passed betwixt us both,
    By whom each knew how other's cause did fare;
    For men to trust men in their love are loth;
    Thus had we both of love a lover's care.
      Haply he seeks his sorrows to renew,
      That for his love doth make another sue.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    By her a kiss, a kiss to me she sent.
    A kiss for price more worth than purest gold.
    She gave it her, to me the kiss was meant;
    A she to kiss, what harm if she were bold?
      Happy those lips that had so sweet a kiss,
      For heaven itself scarce yields so sweet a bliss!

RHYME a b a b c c 

    This modest she, blushing for shame of this,
    Or loth to part from that she liked so well,
    Did play false play, and gave me not the kiss;
    Yet my love's kindness could not choose to tell.
      Then blame me not, that kissing sighed and swore
      I kissed but her whom you had kissed before.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Sweet, love me more, and blame me not, sweet love;
    I kissed those lips, yet harmless I do vow;
    Scarce would my lips from off those lips remove,
    For still methought, sweet fair, I kissed you.
      And thus, kind love, the sum of all my bliss
      Was but begun and ended in a kiss.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Then send me more, but send them by your friend;
    Kiss none but her, nor her, nor none at all.
    Beware by whom such treasures you do send,
    I must them lose except I for them call.
      And love me, dear, and still still kissing be;
      Both like and love, but none, sweet love, but me.

RHYME a b a b 

    If sad complaint would show a lover's pain,
    Or tears express the torments of my heart,
    If melting sighs would ruth and pity gain,
    Or true laments but ease a lover's smart;

RHYME a b a b 

    Then should my plaints the thunder's noise surmount,
    And tears like seas should flow from out my eyes;
    Then sighs like air should far exceed all count,
    And true laments with sorrow dim the skies.

RHYME a b a b 

    But plaints and tears, laments and sighs I spend,
    Yet greater torments do my heart destroy;
    I could all these from out my heart still send,
    If after these I might my love enjoy.

RHYME a b a b 

    But heavens conspire, and heavens I must obey,
    That seeking love I still must want my ease;
    For greatest joys are tempered with delay,
    Things soon obtained do least of all us please.

RHYME a b a b 

    My thoughts repine and think the time too long,
    My love impatient wisheth to obtain;
    I blame the heavens that do me all this wrong
    To make me loved and will not ease my pain.

RHYME a b a b 

    No pain like this, to love and not enjoy;
    No grief like this, to mourn and not be heard;
    No time so long as that which breeds annoy;
    No hell like this, to love and be deferred!

RHYME a b a b 

    But heaven shall stand and earth inconstant fly,
    The sun shall freeze and ice inconstant burn,
    The mountains flow and all the earth be dry,
    Ere time shall force my loving thoughts to turn.

RHYME a b a b 

    Do you resolve, sweet love, to do the same,
    Say that you do, and seal it with a kiss.
    Then shall our truths the heavens' unkindness blame
    That can not hurt yet show their spite in this.

RHYME a b a b 

    The silly 'prentice bound for many years,
    Doth hope that time his service will release;
    The town beseiged that lives in midst of fears,
    Doth hope in time the cruel wars will cease.

RHYME a b a b 

    The toiling plough-man sings in hope to reap,
    The tossed bark expecteth for a shore;
    The boy at school to be at play doth leap,
    And straight forgets the fear he had before.

RHYME a b a b 

    If those by hope do joy in their distress,
    And constant are in hope to conquer time,
    Then let not hope in us, sweet friend, be less,
    And cause our love to wither in the prime.

RHYME a a 

    Let me conspire and time will have an end,
    So both of us in time shall have a friend.

TITLE Fidessa Sonnet Cycle

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fidessa fair, long live a happy maiden!
      Blest from thy cradle by a worthy mother,
      High-thoughted like to her, with bounty laden,
      Like pleasing grace affording, one and other;
    Sweet model of thy far renowned sire!
      Hold back a while thy ever-giving hand,
      And though these free penned lines do nought require,
      For that they scorn at base reward to stand,
    Yet crave they most for that they beg the least
      Dumb is the message of my hidden grief,
      And store of speech by silence is increased;
      O let me die or purchase some relief!
    Bounteous Fidessa cannot be so cruel
    As for to make my heart her fancy's fuel!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    How can that piercing crystal-painted eye,
      That gave the onset to my high aspiring.
      Yielding each look of mine a sweet reply,
      Adding new courage to my heart's desiring,
    How can it shut itself within her ark,
      And keep herself and me both from the light,
      Making us walk in all misguiding dark,
      Aye to remain in confines of the night?
    How is it that so little room contains it,
      That guides the orient as the world the sun,
      Which once obscured most bitterly complains it,
      Because it knows and rules whate'er is done?
    The reason is that they may dread her sight,
    Who doth both give and take away their light.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Venus, and young Adonis sitting by her,
      Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him;
      She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,
      And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.
    "Even thus," quoth she, "the wanton god embraced me!"
      And then she clasped Adonis in her arms;
      "Even thus," quoth she, "the warlike god unlaced me!"
      As if the boy should use like loving charms.
    But he, a wayward boy, refused the offer,
      And ran away the beauteous queen neglecting
      Showing both folly to abuse her proffer,
      And all his sex of cowardice detecting.
    O that I had my mistress at that bay,
    To kiss and clip me till I ran away!

RHYME a b b a a b b a c d c d e e

    Did you sometimes three German brethren see,
      Rancour 'twixt two of them so raging rife,
      That th' one could stick the other with his knife?
    Now if the third assaulted chance to be
    By a fourth stranger, him set on the three,
      Them two 'twixt whom afore was deadly strife
      Made one to rob the stranger of his life;
    Then do you know our state as well as we.
      Beauty and chastity with her were born,
    Both at one birth, and up with her did grow.
      Beauty still foe to chastity was sworn,
    And chastity sworn to be beauty's foe;
      And yet when I lay siege unto her heart,
      Beauty and chastity both take her part.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Arraigned, poor captive at the bar I stand,
      The bar of beauty, bar to all my joys;
      And up I hold my ever trembling hand,
      Wishing or life or death to end annoys.
    And when the judge doth question of the guilt,
      And bids me speak, then sorrow shuts up words.
      Yea, though he say, "Speak boldly what thou wilt!"
      Yet my confused affects no speech affords,
    For why? Alas, my passions have no bound,
      For fear of death that penetrates so near;
      And still one grief another doth confound,
      Yet doth at length a way to speech appear.
    Then, for I speak too late, the Judge doth give
    His sentence that in prison I shall live.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Unhappy sentence, worst of worst of pains,
      To be in darksome silence, out of ken,
      Banished from all that bliss the world contains,
      And thrust from out the companies of men!
    Unhappy sentence, worse than worst of deaths,
      Never to see Fidessa's lovely face!
      O better were I lose ten thousand breaths,
      Than ever live in such unseen disgrace!
    Unhappy sentence, worse than pains of hell,
      To live in self-tormenting griefs alone;
      Having my heart, my prison and my cell,
      And there consumed without relief to moan!
    If that the sentence so unhappy be,
    Then what am I that gave the same to me?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Oft have mine eyes, the agents of mine heart,
      False traitor eyes conspiring my decay,
      Pleaded for grace with dumb and silent art,
      Streaming forth tears my sorrows to allay;
    Moaning the wrong they do unto their lord,
      Forcing the cruel fair by means to yield;
      Making her 'gainst her will some grace t'afford,
      And striving sore at length to win the field;
    Thus work they means to feed my fainting hope,
      And strengthened hope adds matter to each thought;
      Yet when they all come to their end and scope
      They do but wholly bring poor me to nought.
    She'll never yield although they ever cry,
    And therefore we must all together die.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Grief-urging guest, great cause have I to plain me,
      Yet hope persuading hope expecteth grace,
      And saith none but myself shall ever pain me;
      But grief my hopes exceedeth in this case;
    For still my fortune ever more doth cross me
      By worse events than ever I expected;
      And here and there ten thousand ways doth toss me,
      With sad remembrance of my time neglected.
    These breed such thoughts as set my heart on fire,
      And like fell hounds pursue me to my death;
      Traitors unto their sovereign lord and sire,
      Unkind exactors of their father's breath,
    Whom in their rage they shall no sooner kill
    Than they themselves themselves unjustly spill.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My spotless love that never yet was tainted,
      My loyal heart that never can be moved,
      My growing hope that never yet hath fainted,
      My constancy that you full well have proved,
    All these consented have to plead for grace
      These all lie crying at the door of beauty;--
      This wails, this sends out tears, this cries apace,
      All do reward expect of faith and duty;
    Now either thou must prove th' unkindest one,
      And as thou fairest art must cruelest be,
      Or else with pity yield unto their moan,
      Their moan that ever will importune thee.
    Ah, thou must be unkind, and give denial,
    And I, poor I, must stand unto my trial!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Clip not, sweet love, the wings of my desire,
      Although it soar aloft and mount too high:
      But rather bear with me though I aspire,
      For I have wings to bear me to the sky.
    What though I mount, there is no sun but thee!
      And sith no other sun, why should I fear?
      Thou wilt not burn me, though thou terrify,
      And though thy brightness do so great appear.
    Dear, I seek not to batter down thy glory,
      Nor do I envy that thy hope increaseth;
      O never think thy fame doth make me sorry!
      For thou must live by fame when beauty ceaseth.
    Besides, since from one root we both did spring,
    Why should not I thy fame and beauty sing?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Winged with sad woes, why doth fair zephyr blow
      Upon my face, the map of discontent?
      Is it to have the weeds of sorrow grow
      So long and thick, that they will ne'er be spent?
    No, fondling, no! It is to cool the fire
      Which hot desire within thy breast hath made.
      Check him but once and he will soon retire.
      O but he sorrows brought which cannot fade!
    The sorrows that he brought, he took from thee,
      Which fair Fidessa span and thou must wear!
      Yet hath she nothing done of cruelty,
      But for her sake to try what thou wilt bear.
    Come, sorrows, come! You are to me assigned;
    I'll bear you all, it is Fidessa's mind.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    O if my heavenly sighs must prove annoy,
      Which are the sweetest music to my heart,
      Let it suffice I count them as my joy,
      Sweet bitter joy and pleasant painful smart!
    For when my breast is clogged with thousand cares,
      That my poor loaded heart is like to break,
      Then every sigh doth question how it fares,
      Seeming to add their strength, which makes me weak;
    Yet for they friendly are, I entertain them,
      And they too well are pleased with their host.
      But I, had not Fidessa been, ere now had slain them;
      It's for her cause they live, in her they boast;
    They promise help but when they see her face;
    They fainting yield, and dare not sue for grace.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Compare me to the child that plays with fire,
      Or to the fly that dieth in the flame,
      Or to the foolish boy that did aspire
      To touch the glory of high heaven's frame;
    Compare me to Leander struggling in the waves,
      Not able to attain his safety's shore,
      Or to the sick that do expect their graves,
      Or to the captive crying evermore;
    Compare me to the weeping wounded hart,
      Moaning with tears the period of his life,
      Or to the boar that will not feel the smart,
      When he is stricken with the butcher's knife;
    No man to these can fitly me compare;
    These live to die, I die to live in care.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When silent sleep had closed up mine eyes,
      My watchful mind did then begin to muse;
      A thousand pleasing thoughts did then arise,
      That sought by slights their master to abuse.
    I saw, O heavenly sight! Fidessa's face,
      And fair dame nature blushing to behold it;
      Now did she laugh, now wink, now smile apace,
      She took me by the hand and fast did hold it;
    Sweetly her sweet body did she lay down by me;
      "Alas, poor wretch," quoth she, "great is thy sorrow;
      But thou shall comfort find if thou wilt try me.
      I hope, sir boy, you'll tell me news to-morrow."
    With that, away she went, and I did wake withal;
    When ah! my honey thoughts were turned to gall.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Care-charmer sleep! Sweet ease in restless misery!
      The captive's liberty, and his freedom's song!
      Balm of the bruised heart! Man's chief felicity!
      Brother of quiet death, when life is too too long!
    A comedy it is, and now an history;
      What is not sleep unto the feeble mind!
      It easeth him that toils and him that's sorry;
      It makes the deaf to hear, to see the blind;
    Ungentle sleep, thou helpest all but me!
      For when I sleep my soul is vexed most.
      It is Fidessa that doth master thee;
      If she approach, alas, thy power is lost!
    But here she is! See how he runs amain!
    I fear at night he will not come again.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    For I have loved long, I crave reward;
      Reward me not unkindly, think on kindness;
      Kindness becometh those of high regard;
      Regard with clemency a poor man's blindness;
    Blindness provokes to pity when it crieth;
      It crieth "Give!" Dear lady, shew some pity!
      Pity or let him die that daily dieth;
      Dieth he not oft who often sings this ditty?
    This ditty pleaseth me although it choke me;
      Methinks dame Echo weepeth at my moaning,
      Moaning the woes that to complain provoke me.
      Provoke me now no more, but hear my groaning,
    Groaning both day and night doth tear my heart,
    My heart doth know the cause and triumphs in the smart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Sweet stroke,--so might I thrive as I must praise--
      But sweeter hand that gives so sweet a stroke!
      The lute itself is sweetest when she plays.
      But what hear I? A string through fear is broke!
    The lute doth shake as if it were afraid.
      O sure some goddess holds it in her hand,
      A heavenly power that oft hath me dismayed,
      Yet such a power as doth in beauty stand!
    Cease lute, my ceaseless suit will ne'er be heard!
      Ah, too hard-hearted she that will not hear it!
      If I but think on joy, my joy is marred;
      My grief is great, yet ever must I bear it;
    But love 'twixt us will prove a faithful page,
    And she will love my sorrows to assuage.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    O she must love my sorrows to assuage.
      O God, what joy felt I when she did smile,
      Whom killing grief before did cause to rage!
      Beauty is able sorrow to beguile.
    Out, traitor absence! thou dost hinder me,
      And mak'st my mistress often to forget,
      Causing me to rail upon her cruelty,
      Whilst thou my suit injuriously dost let;
    Again her presence doth astonish me,
      And strikes me dumb as if my sense were gone;
      Oh, is not this a strange perplexity?
      In presence dumb, she hears not absent moan;
    Thus absent presence, present absence maketh,
    That hearing my poor suit, she it mistaketh.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My pain paints out my love in doleful verse,
      The lively glass wherein she may behold it;
      My verse her wrong to me doth still rehearse,
      But so as it lamenteth to unfold it.
    Myself with ceaseless tears my harms bewail,
      And her obdurate heart not to be moved;
      Though long-continued woes my senses fail,
      And curse the day, the hour when first I loved.
    She takes the glass wherein herself she sees,
      In bloody colours cruelly depainted;
      And her poor prisoner humbly on his knees,
      Pleading for grace, with heart that never fainted.
    She breaks the glass; alas, I cannot choose
    But grieve that I should so my labour lose!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Great is the joy that no tongue can express!
      Fair babe new born, how much dost thou delight me!
      But what, is mine so great? Yea, no whit less!
      So great that of all woes it doth acquite me.
    It's fair Fidessa that this comfort bringeth,
      Who sorry for the wrongs by her procured,
      Delightful tunes of love, of true love singeth,
      Wherewith her too chaste thoughts were ne'er inured.
    She loves, she saith, but with a love not blind.
      Her love is counsel that I should not love,
      But upon virtues fix a stayed mind.
      But what! This new-coined love, love doth reprove?
    If this be love of which you make such store,
    Sweet, love me less, that you may love me more!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    He that will Caesar be, or else not be--
      Who can aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame,
      Must be of high resolve; but what is he
      That thinks to gain a second Caesar's name?
    Whoe'er he be that climbs above his strength,
      And climbeth high, the greater is his fall!
      For though he sit awhile, we see at length,
      His slippery place no firmness hath at all,
    Great is his bruise that falleth from on high.
      This warneth me that I should not aspire;
      Examples should prevail; I care not, I!
      I perish must or have what I desire!
    This humour doth with mine full well agree
    I must Fidessa's be, or else not be!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    It was of love, ungentle gentle boy!
      That thou didst come and harbour in my breast;
      Not of intent my body to destroy,
      And have my soul, with restless cares opprest.
    But sith thy love doth turn unto my pain,
      Return to Greece, sweet lad, where thou wast born.
      Leave me alone my griefs to entertain,
      If thou forsake me, I am less forlorn;
    Although alone, yet shall I find more ease.
      Then see thou hie thee hence, or I will chase thee;
      Men highly wronged care not to displease;
      My fortune hangs on thee, thou dost disgrace me,
    Yet at thy farewell, play a friendly part;
    To make amends, fly to Fidessa's heart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fly to her heart, hover about her heart,
    With dainty kisses mollify her heart,
    Pierce with thy arrows her obdurate heart,
    With sweet allurements ever move her heart,
    At midday and at midnight touch her heart,
    Be lurking closely, nestle about her heart,
    With power--thou art a god!--command her heart,
    Kindle thy coals of love about her heart,
    Yea, even into thyself transform her heart!
    Ah, she must love! Be sure thou have her heart;
    And I must die if thou have not her heart;
    Thy bed if thou rest well, must be her heart;
    He hath the best part sure that hath her heart;
    What have I not, if I have but her heart!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Striving is past! Ah, I must sink and drown,
      And that in sight of long descried shore!
      I cannot send for aid unto the town,
      All help is vain and I must die therefore.
    Then poor distressed caitiff, be resolved
      To leave this earthly dwelling fraught with care;
      Cease will thy woes, thy corpse in earth involved,
      Thou diest for her that will no help prepare.
    O see, my case herself doth now behold;
      The casement open is; she seems to speak;--
      But she has gone! O then I dare be bold
      And needs must say she caused my heart to break.
    I die before I drown, O heavy case!
    It was because I saw my mistress' face.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Compare me to Pygmalion with his image sotted,
      For, as was he, even so am I deceived.
      The shadow only is to me allotted,
      The substance hath of substance me bereaved.
    Then poor and helpless must I wander still
      In deep laments to pass succeeding days,
      Welt'ring in woes that poor and mighty kill.
      O who is mighty that so soon decays!
    The dread Almighty hath appointed so
      The final period of all worldly things.
      Then as in time they come, so must they go;
      Death common is to beggars and to kings
    For whither do I run beside my text?
    I run to death, for death must be the next.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    The silly bird that hastes unto the net,
      And flutters to and fro till she be taken,
      Doth look some food or succour there to get,
      But loseth life, so much is she mistaken.
    The foolish fly that fleeth to the flame
      With ceaseless hovering and with restless flight,
      Is burned straight to ashes in the same,
      And finds her death where was her most delight
    The proud aspiring boy that needs would pry
      Into the secrets of the highest seat,
      Had some conceit to gain content thereby,
      Or else his folly sure was wondrous great.
    These did through folly perish all and die:
    And though I know it, even so do I.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Poor worm, poor silly worm, alas, poor beast!
      Fear makes thee hide thy head within the ground,
      Because of creeping things thou art the least,
      Yet every foot gives thee thy mortal wound.
    But I, thy fellow worm, am in worse state,
      For thou thy sun enjoyest, but I want mine.
      I live in irksome night, O cruel fate!
      My sun will never rise, nor ever shine.
    Thus blind of light, mine eyes misguide my feet,
      And baleful darkness makes me still afraid;
      Men mock me when I stumble in the street,
      And wonder how my young sight so decayed.
    Yet do I joy in this, even when I fall,
    That I shall see again and then see all.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Well may my soul, immortal and divine,
      That is imprisoned in a lump of clay,
      Breathe out laments until this body pine,
      That from her takes her pleasures all away.
    Pine then, thou loathed prison of my life,
      Untoward subject of the least aggrievance!
      O let me die! Mortality is rife;
      Death comes by wounds, by sickness, care, and chance.
    O earth, the time will come when I'll resume thee,
      And in thy bosom make my resting-place;
      Then do not unto hardest sentence doom me;
      Yield, yield betimes; I must and will have grace!
    Richly shalt thou be entombed, since, for thy grave,
    Fidessa, fair Fidessa, thou shalt have!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Earth, take this earth wherein my spirits languish;
      Spirits, leave this earth that doth in griefs retain you;
      Griefs, chase this earth that it may fade with anguish;
      Spirits, avoid these furies which do pain you!
    O leave your loathsome prison; freedom gain you;
      Your essence is divine; great is your power;
      And yet you moan your wrongs and sore complain you,
      Hoping for joy which fadeth every hour.
    O spirits, your prison loathe and freedom gain you;
      The destinies in deep laments have shut you
      Of mortal hate, because they do disdain you,
      And yet of joy that they in prison put you.
    Earth, take this earth with thee to be enclosed;
    Life is to me, and I to it, opposed!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Weep now no more, mine eyes, but be you drowned
      In your own tears, so many years distilled.
      And let her know that at them long hath frowned,
      That you can weep no more although she willed;
    This hap her cruelty hath her allotten,
       Who whilom was commandress of each part;
       That now her proper griefs must be forgotten
       By those true outward signs of inward smart.
    For how can he that hath not one tear left him,
       Stream out those floods that are due unto her moaning,
       When both of eyes and tears she hath bereft him?
       O yet I'll signify my grief with groaning;
    True sighs, true groans shall echo in the air
    And say, Fidessa, though most cruel, is most fair!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Tongue, never cease to sing Fidessa's praise;
      Heart, however she deserve conceive the best;
      Eyes, stand amazed to see her beauty's rays;
      Lips, steal one kiss and be for ever blest;
    Hands, touch that hand wherein your life is closed;
      Breast, lock up fast in thee thy life's sole treasure;
      Arms, still embrace and never be disclosed;
      Feet, run to her without or pace or measure;
    Tongue, heart, eyes, lips, hands, breast, arms, feet,
      Consent to do true homage to your Queen,
      Lovely, fair, gentle, wise, virtuous, sober, sweet,
      Whose like shall never be, hath never been!
    O that I were all tongue, her praise to shew;
    Then surely my poor heart were freed from woe!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Sore sick of late, nature her due would have,
      Great was my pain where still my mind did rest;
      No hope but heaven, no comfort but my grave,
      Which is of comforts both the last and least;
    But on a sudden, the Almighty sent
      Sweet ease to the distressed and comfortless,
      And gave me longer time for to repent,
      With health and strength the foes of feebleness;
    Yet I my health no sooner 'gan recover,
      But my old thoughts, though full of cares, retained,
      Made me, as erst, become a wretched lover
      Of her that love and lovers aye disdained.
    Then was my pain with ease of pain increased,
    And I ne'er sick until my sickness ceased.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    He that would fain Fidessa's image see,
      My face of force may be his looking-glass.
      There is she portrayed and her cruelty,
      Which as a wonder through the world must pass.
    But were I dead, she would not be betrayed;
      It's I, that 'gainst my will, shall make it known.
      Her cruelty by me must be bewrayed,
      Or I must hide my head and live alone.
    I'll pluck my silver hairs from out my head,
      And wash away the wrinkles of my face;
      Closely immured I'll live as I were dead,
      Before she suffer but the least disgrace.
    How can I hide that is already known?
    I have been seen and have no face but one.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fie pleasure, fie! Thou cloy'st me with delight;
      Sweet thoughts, you kill me if you lower stray!
      O many be the joys of one short night!
      Tush, fancies never can desire allay!
    Happy, unhappy thoughts! I think, and have not.
      Pleasure, O pleasing pain! Shows nought avail me!
      Mine own conceit doth glad me, more I crave not;
      Yet wanting substance, woe doth still assail me.
    Babies do children please, and shadows fools;
      Shows have deceived the wisest many a time.
      Ever to want our wish, our courage cools.
      The ladder broken, 'tis in vain to climb.
    But I must wish, and crave, and seek, and climb;
    It's hard if I obtain not grace in time.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I have not spent the April of my time,
      The sweet of youth in plotting in the air,
      But do at first adventure seek to climb,
      Whilst flowers of blooming years are green and fair.
    I am no leaving of all-withering age,
      I have not suffered many winter lours;
      I feel no storm unless my love do rage,
      And then in grief I spend both days and hours.
    This yet doth comfort that my flower lasted
      Until it did approach my sun too near;
      And then, alas, untimely was it blasted,
      So soon as once thy beauty did appear!
    But after all, my comfort rests in this,
    That for thy sake my youth decayed is.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    O let my heart, my body, and my tongue
      Bleed forth the lively streams of faith unfeigned,
      Worship my saint the gods and saints among,
      Praise and extol her fair that me hath pained!
    O let the smoke of my suppressed desire,
      Raked up in ashes of my burning breast,
      Break out at length and to the clouds aspire,
      Urging the heavens to afford me rest;
    But let my body naturally descend
      Into the bowels of our common mother,
      And to the very centre let it wend,
      When it no lower can, her griefs to smother!
    And yet when I so low do buried lie,
    Then shall my love ascend unto the sky.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fair is my love that feeds among the lilies,
      The lilies growing in that pleasant garden
      Where Cupid's mount, that well beloved hill is,
      And where that little god himself is warden.
    See where my love sits in the beds of spices,
      Beset all round with camphor, myrrh, and roses,
      And interlaced with curious devices,
      Which her from all the world apart incloses.
    There doth she tune her lute for her delight,
      And with sweet music makes the ground to move;
      Whilst I, poor I, do sit in heavy plight,
      Wailing alone my unrespected love,
    Not daring rush into so rare a place,
    That gives to her, and she to it, a grace.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Was never eye did see my mistress' face,
      Was never ear did hear Fidessa's tongue,
      Was never mind that once did mind her grace,
      That ever thought the travail to be long.
    When her I see, no creature I behold,
      So plainly say these advocates of love,
      That now do fear and now to speak are bold,
      Trembling apace when they resolve to prove.
    These strange effects do show a hidden power,
      A majesty all base attempts reproving,
      That glads or daunts as she doth laugh or lower;
      Surely some goddess harbours in their moving
    Who thus my Muse from base attempts hath raised,
    Whom thus my Muse beyond compare hath praised.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My lady's hair is threads of beaten gold,
      Her front the purest crystal eye hath seen,
      Her eyes the brightest stars the heavens hold,
      Her cheeks red roses such as seld have been;
    Her pretty lips of red vermillion die,
      Her hand of ivory the purest white,
      Her blush Aurora or the morning sky,
      Her breast displays two silver fountains bright
    The spheres her voice, her grace the Graces three:
      Her body is the saint that I adore;
      Her smiles and favours sweet as honey be;
      Her feet fair Thetis praiseth evermore.
    But ah, the worst and last is yet behind,
    For of a griffon she doth bear the mind!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Injurious Fates, to rob me of my bliss,
      And dispossess my heart of all his hope!
      You ought with just revenge to punish miss,
      For unto you the hearts of men are ope.
    Injurious Fates, that hardened have her heart,
      Yet make her face to send out pleasing smiles!
      And both are done but to increase my smart,
      And entertain my love with falsed wiles.
    Yet being when she smiles surprised with joy,
      I fain would languish in so sweet a pain,
      Beseeching death my body to destroy,
      Lest on the sudden she should frown again.
    When men do wish for death, Fates have no force;
    But they, when men would live, have no remorse.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    The prison I am in is thy fair face,
      Wherein my liberty enchained lies;
      My thoughts, the bolts that hold me in the place;
      My food, the pleasing looks of thy fair eyes.
    Deep is the prison where I lie enclosed,
      Strong are the bolts that in this cell contain me;
      Sharp is the food necessity imposed,
      When hunger makes me feed on that which pains me.
    Yet do I love, embrace, and follow fast,
      That holds, that keeps, that discontents me most;
      And list not break, unlock, or seek to waste
      The place, the bolts, the food, though I be lost;
    Better in prison ever to remain,
    Than being out to suffer greater pain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When never-speaking silence proves a wonder,
      When ever-flying flame at home remaineth,
      When all-concealing night keeps darkness under,
      When men-devouring wrong true glory gaineth,
    When soul-tormenting grief agrees with joy,
      When Lucifer foreruns the baleful night,
      When Venus doth forsake her little boy,
      When her untoward boy obtaineth sight,
    When Sisyphus doth cease to roll his stone,
      When Otus shaketh off his heavy chain,
      When beauty, queen of pleasure, is alone,
      When love and virtue quiet peace disdain;
    When these shall be, and I not be,
    Then will Fidessa pity me.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Tell me of love, sweet Love, who is thy sire,
      Or if thou mortal or immortal be?
      Some say thou art begotten by desire,
      Nourished with hope, and fed with fantasy,
    Engendered by a heavenly goddess' eye,
      Lurking most sweetly in an angel's face.
      Others, that beauty thee doth deify;--
      O sovereign beauty, full of power and grace!--
    But I must be absurd all this denying,
      Because the fairest fair alive ne'er knew thee.
      Now, Cupid, comes thy godhead to the trying;
      'Twas she alone--such is her power--that slew me;
    She shall be Love, and thou a foolish boy,
    Whose virtue proves thy power is but a toy.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    No choice of change can ever change my mind;
      Choiceless my choice, the choicest choice alive;
      Wonder of women, were she not unkind,
      The pitiless of pity to deprive.
    Yet she, the kindest creature of her kind,
      Accuseth me of self-ingratitude,
      And well she may, sith by good proof I find
      Myself had died, had she not helpful stood.
    For when my sickness had the upper hand,
      And death began to show his awful face,
      She took great pains my pains for to withstand,
      And eased my heart that was in heavy case.
    But cruel now, she scorneth what it craveth;
    Unkind in kindness, murdering while she saveth.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Mine eye bewrays the secrets of my heart,
      My heart unfolds his grief before her face;
      Her face--bewitching pleasure of my smart!--
      Deigns not one look of mercy and of grace.
    My guilty eye of murder and of treason,--
      Friendly conspirator of my decay,
      Dumb eloquence, the lover's strongest reason!--
      Doth weep itself for anger quite away,
    And chooseth rather not to be, than be
      Disloyal, by too well discharging duty;
      And being out, joys it no more can see
      The sugared charms of all deceiving beauty.
    But, for the other greedily doth eye it,
    I pray you tell me, what do I get by it?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    So soon as peeping Lucifer, Aurora's star,
      The sky with golden periwigs doth spangle;
      So soon as Phoebus gives us light from far,
      So soon as fowler doth the bird entangle;
    Soon as the watchful bird, clock of the morn,
      Gives intimation of the day's appearing;
      Soon as the jolly hunter winds his horn,
      His speech and voice with custom's echo clearing;
    Soon as the hungry lion seeks his prey
      In solitary range of pathless mountains;
      Soon as the passenger sets on his way,
      So soon as beasts resort unto the fountains;
    So soon mine eyes their office are discharging,
    And I my griefs with greater griefs enlarging.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I see, I hear, I feel, I know, I rue
      My fate, my fame, my pain, my loss, my fall,
      Mishap, reproach, disdain, a crown, her hue,
      Cruel, still flying, false, fair, funeral,
    To cross, to shame, bewitch, deceive, and kill
      My first proceedings in their flowing bloom.
      My worthless pen fast chained to my will,
      My erring life through an uncertain doom,
    My thoughts that yet in lowliness do mount,
      My heart the subject of her tyranny;
      What now remains but her severe account
      Of murder's crying guilt, foul butchery!
    She was unhappy in her cradle breath,
    That given was to be another's death.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    "Murder! O murder!" I can cry no longer.
      "Murder! O murder!" Is there none to aid me?
      Life feeble is in force, death is much stronger;
      Then let me die that shame may not upbraid me;
    Nothing is left me now but shame or death.
      I fear she feareth not foul murder's guilt,
      Nor do I fear to lose a servile breath.
      I know my blood was given to be spilt.
    What is this life but maze of countless strays,
      The enemy of true felicity,
      Fitly compared to dreams, to flowers, to plays!
      O life, no life to me, but misery!
    Of shame or death, if thou must one,
    Make choice of death and both are gone.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    My cruel fortunes clouded with a frown,
      Lurk in the bosom of eternal night;
      My climbing thoughts are basely hauled down;
      My best devices prove but after-sight.
    Poor outcast of the world's exiled room,
      I live in wilderness of deep lament;
      No hope reserved me but a hopeless tomb,
      When fruitless life and fruitful woes are spent.
    Shall Phoebus hinder little stars to shine,
      Or lofty cedar mushrooms leave to grow?
      Sure mighty men at little ones repine,
      The rich is to the poor a common foe.
    Fidessa, seeing how the world doth go,
    Joineth with fortune in my overthrow.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    When I the hooks of pleasure first devoured,
      Which undigested threaten now to choke me,
      Fortune on me her golden graces showered;
      O then delight did to delight provoke me!
    Delight, false instrument of my decay,
      Delight, the nothing that doth all things move,
      Made me first wander from the perfect way,
      And fast entangled me in the snares of love.
    Then my unhappy happiness at first began,
      Happy in that I loved the fairest fair;
      Unhappily despised, a hapless man;
      Thus joy did triumph, triumph did despair.
    My conquest is--which shall the conquest gain?--
    Fidessa, author both of joy and pain!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Work, work apace, you blessed sisters three,
      In restless twining of my fatal thread!
      O let your nimble hands at once agree,
      To weave it out and cut it off with speed!
    Then shall my vexed and tormented ghost
      Have quiet passage to the Elysian rest,
      And sweetly over death and fortune boast
      In everlasting triumphs with the blest.
    But ah, too well I know you have conspired
      A lingering death for him that loatheth life,
      As if with woes he never could be tired.
      For this you hide your all-dividing knife.
    One comfort yet the heavens have assigned me;
    That I must die and leave my griefs behind me.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    It is some comfort to the wronged man,
      The wronger of injustice to upbraid.
      Justly myself herein I comfort can,
      And justly call her an ungrateful maid.
    Thus am I pleased to rid myself of crime
      And stop the mouth of all-reporting fame,
      Counting my greatest cross the loss of time
      And all my private grief her public shame.
    Ah, but to speak the truth, hence are my cares,
      And in this comfort all discomfort resteth;
      My harms I cause her scandal unawares;
      Thus love procures the thing that love detesteth.
    For he that views the glasses of my smart
    Must need report she hath a flinty heart.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    I was a king of sweet content at least,
      But now from out my kingdom banished;
      I was chief guest at fair dame pleasure's feast,
      But now I am for want of succour famished;
    I was a saint and heaven was my rest,
      But now cast down into the lowest hell.
      Vile caitiffs may not live among the blest,
      Nor blessed men amongst cursed caitiffs dwell.
    Thus am I made an exile of a king;
      Thus choice of meats to want of food is changed;
      Thus heaven's loss doth hellish torments bring;
      Self crosses make me from myself estranged.
    Yet am I still the same but made another;
    Then not the same; alas, I am no other!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    If great Apollo offered as a dower
      His burning throne to beauty's excellence;
      If Jove himself came in a golden shower
      Down to the earth to fetch fair Io thence;
    If Venus in the curled locks was tied
      Of proud Adonis not of gentle kind;
      If Tellus for a shepherd's favour died,
      The favour cruel Love to her assigned;
    If Heaven's winged herald Hermes had
      His heart enchanted with a country maid;
      If poor Pygmalion was for beauty mad;
      If gods and men have all for beauty strayed:
    I am not then ashamed to be included
    'Mongst those that love, and be with love deluded.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    O, No, I dare not! O, I may not speak!
      Yes, yes, I dare, I can, I must, I will!
      Then heart, pour forth thy plaints and do not break;
      Let never fancy manly courage kill;
    Intreat her mildly, words have pleasing charms
      Of force to move the most obdurate heart,
      To take relenting pity of my harms,
      And with unfeigned tears to wail my smart.
    Is she a stock, a block, a stone, a flint?
      Hath she nor ears to hear nor eyes to see?
      If so my cries, my prayers, my tears shall stint!
      Lord! how can lovers so bewitched be!
    I took her to be beauty's queen alone;
    But now I see she is a senseless stone.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Is trust betrayed? Doth kindness grow unkind?
      Can beauty both at once give life and kill?
      Shall fortune alter the most constant mind?
      Will reason yield unto rebelling will?
    Doth fancy purchase praise, and virtue shame?
      May show of goodness lurk in treachery?
      Hath truth unto herself procured blame?
      Must sacred muses suffer misery?
    Are women woe to men, traps for their falls?
      Differ their words, their deeds, their looks, their lives?
      Have lovers ever been their tennis balls?
      Be husbands fearful of the chastest wives?
    All men do these affirm, and so must I,
    Unless Fidessa give to me the lie.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Three playfellows--such three were never seen
      In Venus' court--upon a summer's day,
      Met altogether on a pleasant green,
      Intending at some pretty game to play.
    They Dian, Cupid, and Fidessa were.
      Their wager, beauty, bow, and cruelty;
      The conqueress the stakes away did bear.
      Whose fortune then was it to win all three?
    Fidessa, which doth these as weapons use,
      To make the greatest heart her will obey;
      And yet the most obedient to refuse
      As having power poor lovers to betray.
    With these she wounds, she heals, gives life and death;
    More power hath none that lives by mortal breath.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    O beauty, siren! kept with Circe's rod;
      The fairest good in seem but foulest ill;
      The sweetest plague ordained for man by God,
      The pleasing subject of presumptuous will;
    Th' alluring object of unstayed eyes;
      Friended of all, but unto all a foe;
      The dearest thing that any creature buys,
      And vainest too, it serves but for a show;
    In seem a heaven, and yet from bliss exiling;
      Paying for truest service nought but pain;
      Young men's undoing, young and old beguiling;
      Man's greatest loss though thought his greatest gain!
    True, that all this with pain enough I prove;
    And yet most true, I will Fidessa love.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Do I unto a cruel tiger play,
      That preys on me as wolf upon the lambs,
      Who fear the danger both of night and day
      And run for succour to their tender dams?
    Yet will I pray, though she be ever cruel,
      On bended knee and with submissive heart.
      She is the fire and I must be the fuel;
      She must inflict and I endure the smart.
    She must, she shall be mistress of her will,
      And I, poor I, obedient to the same;
      As fit to suffer death as she to kill;
      As ready to be blamed as she to blame.
    And for I am the subject of her ire,
    All men shall know thereby my love entire.

RHYME a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a 

    O let me sigh, weep, wail, and cry no more;
    Or let me sigh, weep, wail, cry more and more!
    Yea, let me sigh, weep, wail, cry evermore,
    For she doth pity my complaints no more
    Than cruel pagan or the savage Moor;
    But still doth add unto my torments more,
    Which grievous are to me by so much more
    As she inflicts them and doth wish them more.
    O let thy mercy, merciless, be never more!
    So shall sweet death to me be welcome, more
    Than is to hungry beasts the grassy moor,
    As she that to affliction adds yet more,
    Becomes more cruel by still adding more!
    Weary am I to speak of this word "more;"
    Yet never weary she, to plague me more!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

    Fidessa's worth in time begetteth praise;
      Time, praise; praise, fame; fame, wonderment;
      Wonder, fame, praise, time, her worth do raise
      To highest pitch of dread astonishment.
    Yet time in time her hardened heart bewrayeth
      And praise itself her cruelty dispraiseth.
      So that through praise, alas, her praise decayeth,
      And that which makes it fall her honour raiseth!
    Most strange, yet true! So wonder, wonder still,
      And follow fast the wonder of these days;
      For well I know all wonder to fulfil
      Her will at length unto my will obeys.
    Meantime let others praise her constancy,
    And me attend upon her clemency.

RHYME a a a a a a a a a a a a a a

    Most true that I must fair Fidessa love.
    Most true that fair Fidessa cannot love.
    Most true that I do feel the pains of love.
    Most true that I am captive unto love.
    Most true that I deluded am with love.
    Most true that I do find the sleights of love.
    Most true that nothing can procure her love.
    Most true that I must perish in my love.
    Most true that she contemns the god of love.
    Most true that he is snared with her love.
    Most true that she would have me cease to love.
    Most true that she herself alone is love.
    Most true that though she hated, I would love.
    Most true that dearest life shall end with love.

TITLE 1887

RHYME a b a b

From Clee to heaven the beacon burns,
 The shires have seen it plain,
From north and south the sign returns
 And beacons burn again.

RHYME a b a b

Look left, look right, the hills are bright,
 The dales are light between,
Because 'tis fifty years to-night
 That God has saved the Queen.

RHYME a b a b

Now, when the flame they watch not towers
 About the soil they trod,
Lads, we'll remember friends of ours
 Who shared the work with God.

RHYME a b a b

To skies that knit their heartstrings right,
 To fields that bred them brave,
The saviours come not home to-night:
 Themselves they could not save.

RHYME a b a b

It dawns in Asia, tombstones show
 And Shropshire names are read;
And the Nile spills his overflow
 Beside the Severn's dead.

RHYME a b a b

We pledge in peace by farm and town
 The Queen they served in war,
And fire the beacons up and down
 The land they perished for.

RHYME a b a b

"God Save the Queen" we living sing,
 From height to height 'tis heard;
And with the rest your voices ring,
 Lads of the Fifty-third.

RHYME a b a b

Oh, God will save her, fear you not:
 Be you the men you've been,
Get you the sons your fathers got,
 And God will Save the Queen.

TITLE Loveliest of Trees, the Cherry Now

RHYME a a b b

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.

RHYME a a b b

Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.

RHYME a a b b

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.

TITLE Leave your home behind, lad

RHYME a b c b

Leave your home behind, lad,
 And reach your friends your hand,
And go, and luck go with you
 While Ludlow tower shall stand.

RHYME a b c b

Oh, come you home of Sunday
 When Ludlow streets are still
And Ludlow bells are calling
 To farm and lane and mill,

RHYME a b c b

Or come you home of Monday
 When Ludlow market hums
And Ludlow chimes are playing
 "The conquering hero comes,"

RHYME a b c b

Come you home a hero,
 Or come not home at all,
The lads you leave will mind you
 Till Ludlow tower shall fall.

RHYME a b c b

And you will list the bugle
 That blows in lands of morn,
And make the foes of England
 Be sorry you were born.

RHYME a b c b

And you till trump of doomsday
 On lands of morn may lie,
And make the hearts of comrades
 Be heavy where you die.

RHYME a b c b

Leave your home behind you,
 Your friends by field and town
Oh, town and field will mind you
 Till Ludlow tower is down.

TITLE Reveille

RHYME a b a b

Wake: the silver dusk returning
 Up the beach of darkness brims,
And the ship of sunrise burning
 Strands upon the eastern rims.

RHYME a b a b

Wake: the vaulted shadow shatters,
 Trampled to the floor it spanned,
And the tent of night in tatters
 Straws the sky-pavilioned land.

RHYME a b a b

Up, lad, up, 'tis late for lying:
 Hear the drums of morning play;
Hark, the empty highways crying
 "Who'll beyond the hills away?"

RHYME a b a b

Towns and countries woo together,
 Forelands beacon, belfries call;
Never lad that trod on leather
 Lived to feast his heart with all.

RHYME a b a b

Up, lad: thews that lie and cumber
 Sunlit pallets never thrive;
Morns abed and daylight slumber
 Were not meant for man alive.

RHYME a b a b

Clay lies still, but blood's a rover;
 Breath's a ware that will not keep
Up, lad: when the journey's over
 There'll be time enough to sleep.

TITLE Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers

RHYME a b a b c d e d

Oh see how thick the goldcup flowers
 Are lying in field and lane,
With dandelions to tell the hours
 That never are told again.
Oh may I squire you round the meads
 And pick you posies gay?
-'Twill do no harm to take my arm.
 "You may, young man, you may."

RHYME a b a b c d e d

Ah, spring was sent for lass and lad,
 'Tis now the blood runs gold,
And man and maid had best be glad
 Before the world is old.
What flowers to-day may flower to-morrow,
 But never as good as new.
-Suppose I wound my arm right round-
 " 'Tis true, young man, 'tis true."

RHYME a b a b c d e d

Some lads there are, 'tis shame to say,
 That only court to thieve,
And once they bear the bloom away
 'Tis little enough they leave.
Then keep your heart for men like me
 And safe from trustless chaps.
My love is true and all for you.
 "Perhaps, young man, perhaps."

RHYME a b a b c d e d

Oh, look in my eyes, then, can you doubt?
 -Why, 'tis a mile from town.
How green the grass is all about!
 We might as well sit down.
-Ah, life, what is it but a flower?
 Why must true lovers sigh?
Be kind, have pity, my own, my pretty,-
 "Good-bye, young man, good-bye."

TITLE When the lad for longing sighs

RHYME a b a b

When the lad for longing sighs,
 Mute and dull of cheer and pale,
If at death's own door he lies,
 Maiden, you can heal his ail.

RHYME a b a b

Lovers' ills are all to buy:
 The wan look, the hollow tone,
The hung head, the sunken eye,
 You can have them for your own.

RHYME a b a b

Buy them, buy them: eve and morn
 Lovers' ills are all to sell.
Then you can lie down forlorn;
 But the lover will be well.

TITLE When smoke stood up from Ludlow

RHYME a b c b b

When smoke stood up from Ludlow,
 And mist blew off from Teme,
And blithe afield to ploughing
 Against the morning beam
 I strode beside my team,

RHYME a b c b b

The blackbird in the coppice
 Looked out to see me stride,
And hearkened as I whistled
 The tramping team beside,
 And fluted and replied:

RHYME a b c b b

"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
 What use to rise and rise?
Rise man a thousand mornings
 Yet down at last he lies,
 And then the man is wise."

RHYME a b c b b

I heard the tune he sang me,
 And spied his yellow bill;
I picked a stone and aimed it
 And threw it with a will:
 Then the bird was still.

RHYME a b c b b

Then my soul within me
 Took up the blackbird's strain,
And still beside the horses
 Along the dewy lane
 It Sang the song again:

RHYME a b c b b

"Lie down, lie down, young yeoman;
 The sun moves always west;
The road one treads to labour
 Will lead one home to rest,
 And that will be the best."

TITLE Farewell to barn and stack and tree

RHYME a b a b

"Farewell to barn and stack and tree,
 Farewell to Severn shore.
Terence, look your last at me,
 For I come home no more.

RHYME a b a b

"The sun burns on the half-mown hill,
 By now the blood is dried;
And Maurice amongst the hay lies still
 And my knife is in his side."

RHYME a b a b

"My mother thinks us long away;
 'Tis time the field were mown.
She had two sons at rising day,
 To-night she'll be alone."

RHYME a b a b

"And here's a bloody hand to shake,
 And oh, man, here's good-bye;
We'll sweat no more on scythe and rake,
 My bloody hands and I."

RHYME a b a b

"I wish you strength to bring you pride,
 And a love to keep you clean,
And I wish you luck, come Lammastide,
 At racing on the green."

RHYME a b a b

"Long for me the rick will wait,
 And long will wait the fold,
And long will stand the empty plate,
 And dinner will be cold."

TITLE On moonlit heath and lonesome bank

RHYME a b a b

On moonlit heath and lonesome bank
 The sheep beside me graze;
And yon the gallows used to clank
 Fast by the four cross ways.

RHYME a b a b

A careless shepherd once would keep
 The flocks by moonlight there, [1]
And high amongst the glimmering sheep
 The dead man stood on air.

RHYME a b a b

They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:
 The whistles blow forlorn,
And trains all night groan on the rail
 To men that die at morn.

RHYME a b a b

There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,
 Or wakes, as may betide,
A better lad, if things went right,
 Than most that sleep outside.

RHYME a b a b

And naked to the hangman's noose
 The morning clocks will ring
A neck God made for other use
 Than strangling in a string.

RHYME a b a b

And sharp the link of life will snap,
 And dead on air will stand
Heels that held up as straight a chap
 As treads upon the land.

RHYME a b a b

So here I'll watch the night and wait
 To see the morning shine,
When he will hear the stroke of eight
 And not the stroke of nine;

RHYME a b a b

And wish my friend as sound a sleep
 As lads' I did not know,
That shepherded the moonlit sheep
 A hundred years ago.

TITLE The sun at noon to higher air

RHYME a a b b

The sun at noon to higher air,
Unharnessing the silver Pair
That late before his chariot swam,
Rides on the gold wool of the Ram.

RHYME a a b b

So braver notes the storm-cock sings
To start the rusted wheel of things,
And brutes in field and brutes in pen
Leap that the world goes round again.

RHYME a a b b

The boys are up the woods with day
To fetch the daffodils away,
And home at noonday from the hills
They bring no dearth of daffodils.

RHYME a a b b

Afield for palms the girls repair,
And sure enough the palms are there,
And each will find by hedge or pond
Her waving silver-tufted wand.

RHYME a a b b

In farm and field through all the shire
The eye beholds the heart's desire;
Ah, let not only mine be vain,
For lovers should be loved again.

TITLE On your midnight pallet lying

RHYME a b a b c c b

On your midnight pallet lying
 Listen, and undo the door:
Lads that waste the light in sighing
 In the dark should sigh no more;
Night should ease a lover's sorrow;
Therefore, since I go to-morrow;
 Pity me before.

RHYME a b a b c c b

In the land to which I travel,
 The far dwelling, let me say-
Once, if here the couch is gravel,
 In a kinder bed I lay,
And the breast the darnel smothers
Rested once upon another's
 When it was not clay.

TITLE When I watch the living meet

RHYME a b a b

When I watch the living meet,
 And the moving pageant file
Warm and breathing through the street
 Where I lodge a little while,

RHYME a b a b

If the heats of hate and lust
 In the house of flesh are strong,
Let me mind the house of dust
 Where my sojourn shall be long.

RHYME a b a b

In the nation that is not
 Nothing stands that stood before;
There revenges are forgot,
 And the hater hates no more;

RHYME a b a b

Lovers lying two and two
 Ask not whom they sleep beside,
And the bridegroom all night through
 Never turns him to the bride.

TITLE When I was one-and-twenty

RHYME a b c b c d a c

When I was one-and-twenty
 I heard a wise man say,
"Give crowns and pounds and guineas
 But not your heart away;
Give pearls away and rubies
 But keep your fancy free."
But I was one-and-twenty,
 No use to talk to me.

RHYME a b c b a d a d

When I was one-and-twenty
 I heard him say again,
"The heart out of the bosom
 Was never given in vain;
'Tis paid with sighs a plenty
 And sold for endless rue."
And I am two-and-twenty,
 And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.

TITLE There pass the careless people

RHYME a b c b

There pass the careless people
 That call their souls their own:
Here by the road I loiter,
 How idle and alone.

RHYME a b c b

Ah, past the plunge of plummet,
 In seas I cannot sound,
My heart and soul and senses,
 World without end, are drowned.

RHYME a b c b

His folly has not fellow
 Beneath the blue of day
That gives to man or woman
 His heart and soul away.

RHYME a b c b

There flowers no balm to sain him
 From east of earth to west
That's lost for everlasting
 The heart out of his breast.

RHYME a b c b

Here by the labouring highway
 With empty hands I stroll:
Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,
 Lie lost my heart and soul.

TITLE Look not in my eyes, for fear

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Look not in my eyes, for fear
 They mirror true the sight I see,
And there you find your face too clear
 And love it and be lost like me.
One the long nights through must lie
 Spent in star-defeated sighs,
But why should you as well as I
 Perish? gaze not in my eyes.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

A Grecian lad, as I hear tell,
 One that many loved in vain,
Looked into a forest well
 And never looked away again.
There, when the turf in springtime flowers,
 With downward eye and gazes sad,
Stands amid the glancing showers
 A jonquil, not a Grecian lad.

TITLE It nods and curtseys and recovers

RHYME a b a b

It nods and curtseys and recovers
 When the wind blows above,
The nettle on the graves of lovers
 That hanged themselves for love.

RHYME a b a b

The nettle nods, the wind blows over,
 The man, he does not move,
The lover of the grave, the lover
 That hanged himself for love.

TITLE Twice a week the winter thorough

RHYME a b a b

Twice a week the winter thorough
 Here stood I to keep the goal:
Football then was fighting sorrow
 For the young man's soul.

RHYME a b a b

Now in May time to the wicket
 Out I march with bat and pad:
See the son of grief at cricket
 Trying to be glad.

RHYME a b a b

Try I will; no harm in trying:
 Wonder 'tis how little mirth
Keeps the bones of man from lying
 On the bed of earth.

TITLE Oh, when I was in love with you

RHYME a b a b

Oh, when I was in love with you,
 Then I was clean and brave,
And miles around the wonder grew
 How well did I behave.

RHYME a b a b

And now the fancy passes by,
 And nothing will remain,
And miles around they'll say that I
 Am quite myself again.

TITLE The time you won your town the race

RHYME a a b b

The time you won your town the race
We chaired you through the market-place;
Man and boy stood cheering by,
And home we brought you shoulder-high.

RHYME a a b b

To-day, the road all runners come,
Shoulder-high we bring you home,
And set you at your threshold down,
Townsman of a stiller town.

RHYME a a b b

Smart lad, to slip betimes away
From fields where glory does not stay
And early though the laurel grows
It withers quicker than the rose.

RHYME a a b b

Eyes the shady night has shut
Cannot see the record cut,
And silence sounds no worse than cheers
After earth has stopped the ears:

RHYME a a b b

Now you will not swell the rout
Of lads that wore their honours out,
Runners whom renown outran
And the name died before the man.

RHYME a a b b

So set, before its echoes fade,
The fleet foot on the sill of shade,
And hold to the low lintel up
The still-defended challenge-cup.

RHYME a a b b

And round that early-laurelled head
Will flock to gaze the strengthless dead,
And find unwithered on its curls
The garland briefer than a girl's.

TITLE Oh fair enough are sky and plain

RHYME a b a b

Oh fair enough are sky and plain,
 But I know fairer far:
Those are as beautiful again
 That in the water are;

RHYME a b a b

The pools and rivers wash so clean
 The trees and clouds and air,
The like on earth was never seen,
 And oh that I were there.

RHYME a b a b

These are the thoughts I often think
 As I stand gazing down
In act upon the cressy brink
 To strip and dive and drown;

RHYME a b a b

But in the golden-sanded brooks
 And azure meres I spy
A silly lad that longs and looks
 And wishes he were I.

TITLE In summertime on Bredon

RHYME a b c b b

In summertime on Bredon
 The bells they sound so clear;
Round both the shires they ring them
 In steeples far and near,
 A happy noise to hear.

RHYME a b c b b

Here of a Sunday morning
 My love and I would lie
And see the coloured counties,
 And hear the larks so high
 About us in the sky.

RHYME a b c b b

The bells would ring to call her
 In valleys miles away:
"Come all to church, good people;
 Good people, come and pray."
 But here my love would stay.

RHYME a b c b b

And I would turn and answer
 Among the springing thyme,
"Oh, peal upon our wedding,
 And we will hear the chime,
 And come to church in time."

RHYME a b c b b

But when the snows at Christmas
 On Bredon top were strown,
My love rose up so early
 And stole out unbeknown
 And went to church alone.

RHYME a b c b b

They tolled the one bell only,
 Groom there was none to see,
The mourners followed after,
 And so to church went she,
 And would not wait for me.

RHYME a b c b b

The bells they sound on Bredon,
 And still the steeples hum.
"Come all to church, good people,"-
 Oh, noisy bells, be dumb;
 I hear you, I will come.

TITLE The street sounds to the soldiers' tread

RHYME a b a b

The street sounds to the soldiers' tread,
 And out we troop to see:
A single redcoat turns his head,
 He turns and looks at me.

RHYME a b a b

My man, from sky to sky's so far,
 We never crossed before;
Such leagues apart the world's ends are,
 We're like to meet no more;

RHYME a b a b

What thoughts at heart have you and I
 We cannot stop to tell;
But dead or living, drunk or dry,
 Soldier, I wish you well.

TITLE The lads in their hundreds

RHYME a b a b

The lads in their hundreds to Ludlow come in for the fair,
 There's men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold,
The lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there,
 And there with the rest are the lads that will never be old.

RHYME a b a b

There's chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart,
 And many to count are the stalwart, and many the brave,
And many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart,
 And few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave.

RHYME a b a b

I wish one could know them, I wish there were tokens to tell
 The fortunate fellows that now you can never discern;
And then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell
 And watch them depart on the way that they will not return.

RHYME a b a b

But now you may stare as you like and there's nothing to scan;
 And brushing your elbow unguessed-at and not to be told
They carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man,
 The lads that will die in their glory and never be old.

TITLE Say, lad, have you things to do

RHYME a b a b

Say, lad, have you things to do?
 Quick then, while your day's at prime.
Quick, and if 'tis work for two,
 Here am I, man: now's your time.

RHYME a b a b

Send me now, and I shall go;
 Call me, I shall hear you call;
Use me ere they lay me low
 Where a man's no use at all;

RHYME a b a b

Ere the wholesome flesh decay,
 And the willing nerve be numb,
And the lips lack breath to say,
 "No, my lad, I cannot come."

TITLE This time of year a twelvemonth past

RHYME a b a b

This time of year a twelvemonth past,
 When Fred and I would meet,
We needs must jangle, till at last
 We fought and I was beat.

RHYME a b a b

So then the summer fields about,
 Till rainy days began,
Rose Harland on her Sundays out
 Walked with the better man.

RHYME a b a b

The better man she walks with still,
 Though now 'tis not with Fred:
A lad that lives and has his will
 Is worth a dozen dead.

RHYME a b a b

Fred keeps the house all kinds of weather,
 And clay's the house he keeps;
When Rose and I walk out together
 Stock-still lies Fred and sleeps.

TITLE Along the fields as we came by

RHYME a a *

 Along the fields as we came by
A year ago, my love and I,
The aspen over stile and stone
Was talking to itself alone.
"Oh who are these that kiss and pass?
A country lover and his lass;
Two lovers looking to be wed;
And time shall put them both to bed,
But she shall lie with earth above,
And he beside another love."

RHYME a a *

 And sure enough beneath the tree
There walks another love with me,
And overhead the aspen heaves
Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;
And I spell nothing in their stir,
But now perhaps they speak to her,
And plain for her to understand
They talk about a time at hand
When I shall sleep with clover clad,
And she beside another lad.

TITLE Is my team ploughing

RHYME a b c b

"Is my team ploughing,
 That I was used to drive
And hear the harness jingle
 When I was man alive?"

RHYME a b c b

Ay, the horses trample,
 The harness jingles now;
No change though you lie under
 The land you used to plough.

RHYME a b c b

"Is football playing
 Along the river shore,
With lads to chase the leather,
 Now I stand up no more?"

RHYME a b c b

Ay, the ball is flying,
 The lads play heart and soul;
The goal stands up, the keeper
 Stands up to keep the goal.

RHYME a b c b

"Is my girl happy,
 That I thought hard to leave,
And has she tired of weeping
 As she lies down at eve?"

RHYME a b c b

Ay, she lies down lightly,
 She lies not down to weep:
Your girl is well contented.
 Be still, my lad, and sleep.

RHYME a b c b

"Is my friend hearty,
 Now I am thin and pine,
And has he found to sleep in
 A better bed than mine?"

RHYME a b c b

Yes, lad, I lie easy,
 I lie as lads would choose;
I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,
 Never ask me whose.

TITLE High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam

RHYME a a b b

High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam
Islanded in Severn stream;
The bridges from the steepled crest
Cross the water east and west.

RHYME a a b b

The flag of morn in conqueror's state
Enters at the English gate:
The vanquished eve, as night prevails,
Bleeds upon the road to Wales.

RHYME a a b b

Ages since the vanquished bled
Round my mother's marriage-bed;
There the ravens feasted far
About the open house of war:

RHYME a a b b

When Severn down to Buildwas ran
Coloured with the death of man,
Couched upon her brother's grave
The Saxon got me on the slave.

RHYME a a b b

The sound of fight is silent long
That began the ancient wrong;
Long the voice of tears is still
That wept of old the endless ill.

RHYME a a b b

In my heart it has not died,
The war that sleeps on Severn side;
They cease not fighting, east and west,
On the marches of my breast.

RHYME a a b b

Here the truceless armies yet
Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;
They kill and kill and never die;
And I think that each is I.

RHYME a a b b

None will part us, none undo
The knot that makes one flesh of two,
Sick with hatred, sick with pain,
Strangling-When shall we be slain?

RHYME a a b b

When shall I be dead and rid
Of the wrong my father did?
How long, how long, till spade and hearse
Put to sleep my mother's curse?

TITLE 'Tis spring; come out to ramble

RHYME a b a b b

'Tis spring; come out to ramble
 The hilly brakes around,
For under thorn and bramble
 About the hollow ground
 The primroses are found.

RHYME a b a b b

And there's the windflower chilly
 With all the winds at play,
And there's the Lenten lily
 That has not long to stay
 And dies on Easter day.

RHYME a b a b b

And since till girls go maying
 You find the primrose still,
And find the windflower playing
 With every wind at will,
 But not the daffodil,

RHYME a b a b b

Bring baskets now, and sally
 Upon the spring's array,
And bear from hill and valley
 The daffodil away
 That dies on Easter day.

TITLE Others, I am not the first

RHYME a a b b

Others, I am not the first,
Have willed more mischief than they durst:
If in the breathless night I too
Shiver now, 'tis nothing new.

RHYME a a b b

More than I, if truth were told,
Have stood and sweated hot and cold,
And through their reins in ice and fire
Fear contended with desire.

RHYME a a b b

Agued once like me were they,
But I like them shall win my way
Lastly to the bed of mould
Where there's neither heat nor cold.

RHYME a a b b

But from my grave across my brow
Plays no wind of healing now,
And fire and ice within me fight
Beneath the suffocating night.

TITLE On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble

RHYME a b a b

On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble;
 His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;
The gale, it plies the saplings double,
 And thick on Severn snow the leaves.

RHYME a b a b

'Twould blow like this through holt and hanger
 When Uricon the city stood:
'Tis the old wind in the old anger,
 But then it threshed another wood.

RHYME a b a b

Then, 'twas before my time, the Roman
 At yonder heaving hill would stare:
The blood that warms an English yeoman,
 The thoughts that hurt him, they were there.

RHYME a b a b

There, like the wind through woods in riot,
 Through him the gale of life blew high;
The tree of man was never quiet:
 Then 'twas the Roman, now 'tis I.

RHYME a b a b

The gale, it plies the saplings double,
 It blows so hard, 'twill soon be gone:
To-day the Roman and his trouble
 Are ashes under Uricon.

TITLE From far, from eve and morning

RHYME a b c b

From far, from eve and morning
 And yon twelve-winded sky,
The stuff of life to knit me
 Blew hither: here am I.

RHYME a b c b

Now- for a breath I tarry
 Nor yet disperse apart-
Take my hand quick and tell me,
 What have you in your heart.

RHYME a b c b

Speak now, and I will answer;
 How shall I help you, say;
Ere to the wind's twelve quarters
 I take my endless way.

TITLE If truth in hearts that perish

RHYME a b c b

If truth in hearts that perish
 Could move the powers on high,
I think the love I bear you
 Should make you not to die.

RHYME a b c b

Sure, sure, if stedfast meaning,
 If single thought could save,
The world might end to-morrow,
 You should not see the grave.

RHYME a b c b

This long and sure-set liking,
 This boundless will to please,
-Oh, you should live for ever
 If there were help in these.

RHYME a b c b

But now, since all is idle,
 To this lost heart be kind,
Ere to a town you journey
 Where friends are ill to find.

TITLE Oh, sick I am to see you

RHYME a a b b

_ "Oh, sick I am to see you, will you never let me be?
You may be good for something, but you are not good for me.
Oh, go where you are wanted, for you are not wanted here." _
And that was all the farewell when I parted from my dear.

RHYME a a b b

"I will go where I am wanted, to a lady born and bred
Who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red;
She will not be sick to see me if I only keep it clean:
I will go where I am wanted for a soldier of the Queen."

RHYME a a b b

"I will go where I am wanted, for the sergeant does not mind;
He may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind:
He gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap,
And I never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap."

RHYME a a b b

"I will go where I am wanted, where there's room for one or two,
And the men are none too many for the work there is to do;
Where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick;
And the enemies of England they shall see me and be sick."

TITLE On the idle hill of summer

RHYME a b a b

On the idle hill of summer,
 Sleepy with the flow of streams,
Far I hear the steady drummer
 Drumming like a noise in dreams.

RHYME a b a b

Far and near and low and louder
 On the roads of earth go by,
Dear to friends and food for powder,
 Soldiers marching, all to die.

RHYME a b a b

East and west on fields forgotten
 Bleach the bones of comrades slain,
Lovely lads and dead and rotten;
 None that go return again.

RHYME a b a b

Far the calling bugles hollo,
 High the screaming fife replies,
Gay the files of scarlet follow:
 Woman bore me, I will rise.

TITLE White in the moon the long road lies

RHYME a b a b

White in the moon the long road lies,
 The moon stands blank above;
White in the moon the long road lies
 That leads me from my love.

RHYME a b a b

Still hangs the hedge without a gust,
 Still, still the shadows stay:
My feet upon the moonlit dust
 Pursue the ceaseless way.

RHYME a b a b

The world is round, so travellers tell,
 And straight though reach the track,
Trudge on, trudge on, 'twill all be well,
 The way will guide one back.

RHYME a b a b

But ere the circle homeward hies
 Far, far must it remove:
White in the moon the long road lies
 That leads me from my love.

TITLE As through the wild green hills of Wyre

RHYME a a *

 As through the wild green hills of Wyre
The train ran, changing sky and shire,
And far behind, a fading crest,
Low in the forsaken west
Sank the high-reared head of Clee,
My hand lay empty on my knee.
Aching on my knee it lay:
That morning half a shire away
So many an honest fellow's fist
Had well-nigh wrung it from the wrist.
Hand, said I, since now we part
From fields and men we know by heart,
From strangers' faces, strangers' lands,-
Hand, you have held true fellows' hands.
Be clean then; rot before you do
A thing they'd not believe of you.
You and I must keep from shame
In London streets the Shropshire name;
On banks of Thames they must not say
Severn breeds worse men than they;
And friends abroad must bear in mind
Friends at home they leave behind.
Oh, I shall be stiff and cold
When I forget you, hearts of gold;
The land where I shall mind you not
Is the land where all's forgot.
And if my foot returns no more
To Teme nor Corve nor Severn shore,
Luck, my lads, be with you still
By falling stream and standing hill,
By chiming tower and whispering tree,
Men that made a man of me.
About your work in town and farm
Still you'll keep my head from harm,
Still you'll help me, hands that gave
A grasp to friend me to the grave.

TITLE The winds out of the west land blow

RHYME a b a b

The winds out of the west land blow,
 My friends have breathed them there;
Warm with the blood of lads I know
 Comes east the sighing air.

RHYME a b a b

It fanned their temples, filled their lungs,
 Scattered their forelocks free;
My friends made words of it with tongues
 That talk no more to me.

RHYME a b a b

Their voices, dying as they fly,
 Thick on the wind are sown;
The names of men blow soundless by,
 My fellows' and my own.

RHYME a b a b

Oh lads, at home I heard you plain,
 But here your speech is still,
And down the sighing wind in vain
 You hollo from the hill.

RHYME a b a b

The wind and I, we both were there,
 But neither long abode;
Now through the friendless world we fare
 And sigh upon the road.

TITLE 'Tis time, I think by Wenlock town

RHYME a b a b

'Tis time, I think by Wenlock town
 The golden broom should blow;
The hawthorn sprinkled up and down
 Should charge the land with snow.

RHYME a b a b

Spring will not wait the loiterer's time
 Who keeps so long away;
So others wear the broom and climb
 The hedgerows heaped with may.

RHYME a b a b

Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge,
 Gold that I never see;
Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge
 That will not shower on me.

TITLE Into my heart an air that kills

RHYME a b a b

Into my heart an air that kills
 From yon far country blows:
What are those blue remembered hills,
 What spires, what farms are those?

RHYME a b a b

That is the land of lost content,
 I see it shining plain,
The happy highways where I went
 And cannot come again.

TITLE In my own shire, if I was sad

RHYME a a *

 In my own shire, if I was sad
Homely comforters I had:
The earth, because my heart was sore,
Sorrowed for the son she bore;
And standing hills, long to remain,
Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.
And bound for the same bourn as I,
On every road I wandered by,
Trod beside me, close and dear,
The beautiful and death-struck year:
Whether in the woodland brown
I heard the beechnut rustle down,
And saw the purple crocus pale
Flower about the autumn dale;
Or littering far the fields of May
Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,
And like a skylit water stood
The bluebells in the azured wood.

RHYME a a *

 Yonder, lightening other loads,
The seasons range the country roads,
But here in London streets I ken
No such helpmates, only men;
And these are not in plight to bear,
If they would, another's care.
They have enough as 'tis: I see
In many an eye that measures me
The mortal sickness of a mind
Too unhappy to be kind.
Undone with misery, all they can
Is to hate their fellow man;
And till they drop they needs must still
Look at you and wish you ill.

TITLE Once in the wind of morning

RHYME a b c b

Once in the wind of morning
 I ranged the thymy wold;
The world-wide air was azure
 And all the brooks ran gold.

RHYME a b c b

There through the dews beside me
 Behold a youth that trod,
With feathered cap on forehead,
 And poised a golden rod.

RHYME a b c b

With mien to match the morning
 And gay delightful guise
And friendly brows and laughter
 He looked me in the eyes.

RHYME a b c b

Oh whence, I asked, and whither?
 He smiled and would not say,
And looked at me and beckoned
 And laughed and led the way.

RHYME a b c b

And with kind looks and laughter
 And nought to say beside
We two went on together,
 I and my happy guide.

RHYME a b c b

Across the glittering pastures
 And empty upland still
And solitude of shepherds
 High in the folded hill,

RHYME a b c b

By hanging woods and hamlets
 That gaze through orchards down
On many a windmill turning
 And far-discovered town,

RHYME a b c b

With gay regards of promise
 And sure unslackened stride
And smiles and nothing spoken
 Led on my merry guide.

RHYME a b c b

By blowing realms of woodland
 With sunstruck vanes afield
And cloud-led shadows sailing
 About the windy weald,

RHYME a b c b

By valley-guarded granges
 And silver waters wide,
Content at heart I followed
 With my delightful guide.

RHYME a b c b

And like the cloudy shadows
 Across the country blown
We two face on for ever,
 But not we two alone.

RHYME a b c b

With the great gale we journey
 That breathes from gardens thinned,
Borne in the drift of blossoms
 Whose petals throng the wind;

RHYME a b c b

Buoyed on the heaven-heard whisper
 Of dancing leaflets whirled
From all the woods that autumn
 Bereaves in all the world.

RHYME a b c b

And midst the fluttering legion
 Of all that ever died
I follow, and before us
 Goes the delightful guide,

RHYME a b c b

With lips that brim with laughter
 But never once respond,
And feet that fly on feathers,
 And serpent-circled wand.

TITLE When I meet the morning beam

RHYME a a b b

When I meet the morning beam,
Or lay me down at night to dream,
I hear my bones within me say,
"Another night, another day."

RHYME a a b b

"When shall this slough of sense be cast,
This dust of thoughts be laid at last,
The man of flesh and soul be slain
And the man of bone remain?"

RHYME a a b b

"This tongue that talks, these lungs that shout,
These thews that hustle us about,
This brain that fills the skull with schemes,
And its humming hive of dreams,-"

RHYME a a b b

"These to-day are proud in power
And lord it in their little hour:
The immortal bones obey control
Of dying flesh and dying soul."

RHYME a a b b

" 'Tis long till eve and morn are gone:
Slow the endless night comes on,
And late to fulness grows the birth
That shall last as long as earth."

RHYME a a b b

"Wanderers eastward, wanderers west,
Know you why you cannot rest?
'Tis that every mother's son
Travails with a skeleton."

RHYME a a b b

"Lie down in the bed of dust;
Bear the fruit that bear you must;
Bring the eternal seed to light,
And morn is all the same as night."

RHYME a a b b

"Rest you so from trouble sore,
Fear the heat o' the sun no more,
Nor the snowing winter wild,
Now you labour not with child."

RHYME a a b b

"Empty vessel, garment cast,
We that wore you long shall last.
-Another night, another day."
So my bones within me say.

RHYME a a b b

Therefore they shall do my will
To-day while I am master still,
And flesh and soul, now both are strong,
Shall hale the sullen slaves along,

RHYME a a b b

Before this fire of sense decay,
This smoke of thought blow clean away,
And leave with ancient night alone
The stedfast and enduring bone.

TITLE Shot? so quick, so clean an ending

RHYME a b a b

Shot? so quick, so clean an ending?
 Oh that was right, lad, that was brave:
Yours was not an ill for mending,
 'Twas best to take it to the grave.

RHYME a b a b

Oh you had forethought, you could reason,
 And saw your road and where it led,
And early wise and brave in season
 Put the pistol to your head.

RHYME a b a b

Oh soon, and better so than later
 After long disgrace and scorn,
You shot dead the household traitor,
 The soul that should not have been born.

RHYME a b a b

Right you guessed the rising morrow
 And scorned to tread the mire you must:
Dust's your wages, son of sorrow,
 But men may come to worse than dust.

RHYME a b a b

Souls undone, undoing others,-
 Long time since the tale began.
You would not live to wrong your brothers:
 Oh lad, you died as fits a man.

RHYME a b a b

Now to your grave shall friend and stranger
 With ruth and some with envy come:
Undishonoured, clear of danger,
 Clean of guilt, pass hence and home.

RHYME a b a b

Turn safe to rest, no dreams, no waking;
 And here, man, here's the wreath I've made:
'Tis not a gift that's worth the taking,
 But wear it and it will not fade.

TITLE If it chance your eye offend you

RHYME a b a b

If it chance your eye offend you,
 Pluck it out, lad, and be sound:
'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,
 And many a balsam grows on ground.

RHYME a b a b

And if your hand or foot offend you,
 Cut it off, lad, and be whole;
But play the man, stand up and end you,
 When your sickness is your soul.

TITLE Bring, in this timeless grave to throw

RHYME a a *

 Bring, in this timeless grave to throw,
No cypress, sombre on the snow;
Snap not from the bitter yew
His leaves that live December through;
Break no rosemary, bright with rime
And sparkling to the cruel clime;
Nor plod the winter land to look
For willows in the icy brook
To cast them leafless round him: bring
No spray that ever buds in spring.

RHYME a a *

 But if the Christmas field has kept
Awns the last gleaner overstept,
Or shrivelled flax, whose flower is blue
A single season, never two;
Or if one haulm whose year is o'er
Shivers on the upland frore,
-Oh, bring from hill and stream and plain
Whatever will not flower again,
To give him comfort: he and those
Shall bide eternal bedfellows
Where low upon the couch he lies
Whence he never shall arise.

TITLE Here the hangman stops his cart

RHYME a a b b

"Here the hangman stops his cart:
Now the best of friends must part.
Fare you well, for ill fare I:
Live, lads, and I will die."

RHYME a a b b

"Oh, at home had I but stayed
'Prenticed to my father's trade,
Had I stuck to plane and adze,
I had not been lost, my lads."

RHYME a a b b

"Then I might have built perhaps
Gallows-trees for other chaps,
Never dangled on my own,
Had I but left ill alone."

RHYME a a b b

"Now, you see, they hang me high,
And the people passing by
Stop to shake their fists and curse;
So 'tis come from ill to worse."

RHYME a a b b

"Here hang I, and right and left
Two poor fellows hang for theft:
All the same's the luck we prove,
Though the midmost hangs for love."

RHYME a a b b

"Comrades all, that stand and gaze,
Walk henceforth in other ways;
See my neck and save your own:
Comrades all, leave ill alone."

RHYME a a b b

"Make some day a decent end,
Shrewder fellows than your friend.
Fare you well, for ill fare I:
Live, lads, and I will die."

TITLE Be still, my soul, be still

RHYME a b a b

Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,
 Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.
Think rather,-call to thought, if now you grieve a little,
 The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.

RHYME a b a b

Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry
 I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;
Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:
 Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.

RHYME a b a b

Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,
 I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.
Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:
 Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.

RHYME a b a b

Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;
 All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:
Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation-
 Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?

TITLE Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly

RHYME a b c c a b

Think no more, lad; laugh, be jolly:
 Why should men make haste to die?
Empty heads and tongues a-talking
Make the rough road easy walking,
And the feather pate of folly
 Bears the falling sky.

RHYME a b c c a b

Oh, 'tis jesting, dancing, drinking
 Spins the heavy world around.
If young hearts were not so clever,
Oh, they would be young for ever:
Think no more; 'tis only thinking
 Lays lads underground.

TITLE In valleys of springs of rivers

RHYME a b a b

In valleys of springs of rivers,
 By Ony and Teme and Clun,
The country for easy livers,
 The quietest under the sun,

RHYME a b a b

We still had sorrows to lighten,
 One could not be always glad,
And lads knew trouble at Knighton
 When I was a Knighton lad.

RHYME a b a b

By bridges that Thames runs under,
 In London, the town built ill,
'Tis sure small matter for wonder
 If sorrow is with one still.

RHYME a b a b

And if as a lad grows older
 The troubles he bears are more,
He carries his griefs on a shoulder
 That handselled them long before.

RHYME a b a b

Where shall one halt to deliver
 This luggage I'd lief set down?
Not Thames, not Teme is the river,
 Nor London nor Knighton the town:

RHYME a b a b

'Tis a long way further than Knighton,
 A quieter place than Clun,
Where doomsday may thunder and lighten
 And little 'twill matter to one.

TITLE Loitering with a vacant eye

RHYME a a *

 Loitering with a vacant eye
Along the Grecian gallery,
And brooding on my heavy ill,
I met a statue standing still.
Still in marble stone stood he,
And stedfastly he looked at me.
"Well met," I thought the look would say,
"We both were fashioned far away;
We neither knew, when we were young,
These Londoners we live among."

RHYME a a *

 Still he stood and eyed me hard,
An earnest and a grave regard:
"What, lad, drooping with your lot?
I too would be where I am not.
I too survey that endless line
Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.
Years, ere you stood up from rest,
On my neck the collar prest;
Years, when you lay down your ill,
I shall stand and bear it still.
Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:
Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."
So I thought his look would say;
And light on me my trouble lay,
And I slept out in flesh and bone
Manful like the man of stone.

TITLE Far in a western brookland

RHYME a b c b

Far in a western brookland
 That bred me long ago
The poplars stand and tremble
 By pools I used to know.

RHYME a b c b

There, in the windless night-time,
 The wanderer, marvelling why,
Halts on the bridge to hearken
 How soft the poplars sigh.

RHYME a b c b

He hears: long since forgotten
 In fields where I was known,
Here I lie down in London
 And turn to rest alone.

RHYME a b c b

There, by the starlit fences,
 The wanderer halts and hears
My soul that lingers sighing
 About the glimmering weirs.

TITLE The lad came to the door at night

RHYME a b a b

The lad came to the door at night,
 When lovers crown their vows,
And whistled soft and out of sight
 In shadow of the boughs.

RHYME a b a b

"I shall not vex you with my face
 Henceforth, my love, for aye;
So take me in your arms a space
 Before the east is grey."

RHYME a b a b

"When I from hence away am past
 I shall not find a bride,
And you shall be the first and last
 I ever lay beside."

RHYME a b a b

She heard and went and knew not why;
 Her heart to his she laid;
Light was the air beneath the sky
 But dark under the shade.

RHYME a b a b

"Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast
 Seems not to rise and fall,
And here upon my bosom prest
 There beats no heart at all?"

RHYME a b a b

"Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,
 You should have felt it then;
But since for you I stopped the clock
 It never goes again."

RHYME a b a b

"Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips
 Wet from your neck on mine?
What is it falling on my lips,
 My lad, that tastes of brine?"

RHYME a b a b

"Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,
 For when the knife has slit
The throat across from ear to ear
 'Twill bleed because of it."

RHYME a b a b

Under the stars the air was light
 But dark below the boughs,
The still air of the speechless night,
 When lovers crown their vows.

TITLE With rue my heart is laden

RHYME a b a b

With rue my heart is laden
 For golden friends I had,
For many a rose-lipt maiden
 And many a lightfoot lad.

RHYME a b a b

By brooks too broad for leaping
 The lightfoot boys are laid;
The rose-lipt girls are sleeping
 In fields where roses fade.

TITLE Westward on the high-hilled plains

RHYME a b a b

Westward on the high-hilled plains
 Where for me the world began,
Still, I think, in newer veins
 Frets the changeless blood of man.

RHYME a b a b

Now that other lads than I
 Strip to bathe on Severn shore,
They, no help, for all they try,
 Tread the mill I trod before.

RHYME a b a b

There, when hueless is the west
 And the darkness hushes wide,
Where the lad lies down to rest
 Stands the troubled dream beside.

RHYME a b a b

There, on thoughts that once were mine,
 Day looks down the eastern steep,
And the youth at morning shine
 Makes the vow he will not keep.

TITLE Far I hear the bugle blow

RHYME a a b b

"Far I hear the bugle blow
To call me where I would not go,
And the guns begin the song,
'Soldier, fly or stay for long.'"

RHYME a a b b

"Comrade, if to turn and fly
Made a soldier never die,
Fly I would, for who would not?
'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot."

RHYME a a b b

"But since the man that runs away
Lives to die another day,
And cowards' funerals, when they come
Are not wept so well at home."

RHYME a a b b

"Therefore, though the best is bad,
Stand and do the best my lad;
Stand and fight and see your slain,
And take the bullet in your brain."

TITLE You smile upon your friend to-day

RHYME a b a b

You smile upon your friend to-day,
 To-day his ills are over;
You hearken to the lover's say,
 And happy is the lover.

RHYME a b a b

'Tis late to hearken, late to smile,
 But better late than never:
I shall have lived a little while
 Before I die for ever.

TITLE When I came last to Ludlow

RHYME a b c b

When I came last to Ludlow
 Amidst the moonlight pale,
Two friends kept step beside me,
 Two honest lads and hale.

RHYME a b c b

Now Dick lies long in the churchyard,
 And Ned lies long in jail,
And I come home to Ludlow
 Amidst the moonlight pale.

TITLE The star-filled seas are smooth to-night

RHYME a b a b

The star-filled seas are smooth to-night
 From France to England strown;
Black towers above the Portland light
 The felon-quarried stone.

RHYME a b a b

On yonder island, not to rise,
 Never to stir forth free,
Far from his folk a dead lad lies
 That once was friends with me.

RHYME a b a b

Lie you easy, dream you light,
 And sleep you fast for aye;
And luckier may you find the night
 Than ever you found the day.

TITLE Now hollow fires burn out to black

RHYME a b a b

Now hollow fires burn out to black,
 And lights are guttering low:
Square your shoulders, lift your pack,
 And leave your friends and go.

RHYME a b a b

Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread,
 Look not left nor right:
In all the endless road you tread
 There's nothing but the night.

TITLE The vane on Hughley steeple

RHYME a b a b c d c d

The vane on Hughley steeple
 Veers bright, a far-known sign,
And there lie Hughley people,
 And there lie friends of mine.
Tall in their midst the tower
 Divides the shade and sun,
And the clock strikes the hour
 And tells the time to none.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

To south the headstones cluster,
 The sunny mounds lie thick;
The dead are more in muster
 At Hughley than the quick.
North, for a soon-told number,
 Chill graves the sexton delves,
And steeple-shadowed slumber
 The slayers of themselves.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

To north, to south, lie parted,
 With Hughley tower above,
The kind, the single-hearted,
 The lads I used to love.
And, south or north, 'tis only
 A choice of friends one knows,
And I shall ne'er be lonely
 Asleep with these or those.

TITLE Terence, this is stupid stuff

RHYME a a *

 "Terence, this is stupid stuff:
You eat your victuals fast enough;
There can't be much amiss, 'tis clear,
To see the rate you drink your beer.
But oh, good Lord, the verse you make,
It gives a chap the belly-ache.
The cow, the old cow, she is dead;
It sleeps well, the horned head:
We poor lads, 'tis our turn now
To hear such tunes as killed the cow.
Pretty friendship 'tis to rhyme
Your friends to death before their time
Moping melancholy mad:
Come, pipe a tune to dance to, lad."

RHYME a a *

 Why, if 'tis dancing you would be,
There's brisker pipes than poetry.
Say, for what were hop-yards meant,
Or why was Burton built on Trent?
Oh many a peer of England brews
Livelier liquor than the Muse,
And malt does more than Milton can
To justify God's ways to man.
Ale, man, ale's the stuff to drink
For fellows whom it hurts to think:
Look into the pewter pot
To see the world as the world's not.
And faith, 'tis pleasant till 'tis past:
The mischief is that 'twill not last.
Oh I have been to Ludlow fair
And left my necktie God knows where,
And carried half-way home, or near,
Pints and quarts of Ludlow beer:
Then the world seemed none so bad,
And I myself a sterling lad;
And down in lovely muck I've lain,
Happy till I woke again.
Then I saw the morning sky:
Heigho, the tale was all a lie;
The world, it was the old world yet,
I was I, my things were wet,
And nothing now remained to do
But begin the game anew.

 Therefore, since the world has still
Much good, but much less good than ill,
And while the sun and moon endure
Luck's a chance, but trouble's sure,
I'd face it as a wise man would,
And train for ill and not for good.
'Tis true the stuff I bring for sale
Is not so brisk a brew as ale:
Out of a stem that scored the hand
I wrung it in a weary land.
But take it: if the smack is sour,
The better for the embittered hour;
It should do good to heart and head
When your soul is in my soul's stead;
And I will friend you, if I may,
In the dark and cloudy day.

 There was a king reigned in the East:
There, when kings will sit to feast,
They get their fill before they think
With poisoned meat and poisoned drink.
He gathered all that springs to birth
From the many-venomed earth;
First a little, thence to more,
He sampled all her killing store;
And easy, smiling, seasoned sound,
Sate the king when healths went round.
They put arsenic in his meat
And stared aghast to watch him eat;
They poured strychnine in his cup
And shook to see him drink it up:
They shook, they stared as white's their shirt:
Them it was their poison hurt.
-I tell the tale that I heard told.
Mithridates, he died old.

TITLE I Hoed and trenched and weeded

RHYME a b a b

I Hoed and trenched and weeded,
 And took the flowers to fair:
I brought them home unheeded;
 The hue was not the wear.

RHYME a b a b

So up and down I sow them
 For lads like me to find,
When I shall lie below them,
 A dead man out of mind.

RHYME a b a b

Some seed the birds devour,
 And some the season mars,
But here and there will flower
 The solitary stars,

RHYME a b a b

And fields will yearly bear them
 As light-leaved spring comes on,
And luckless lads will wear them
 When I am dead and gone.

TITLE Prologue to Last Poems

RHYME a b c a c b b a a c d a

We'll to the woods no more,
     The laurels are all cut,
     The bowers are bare of bay
     That once the Muses wore;
     The year draws in the day
     And soon will evening shut:
     The laurels all are cut,
     We'll to the woods no more.
     Oh we'll no more, no more
     To the leafy woods away,
     To the high wild woods of laurel
     And the bowers of bay no more.

TITLE The West

RHYME a a b b

Beyond the moor and mountain crest
-- Comrade, look not on the west --
The sun is down and drinks away
From air and land the lees of day.

RHYME a a b b

The long cloud and the single pine
Sentinel the ending line,
And out beyond it, clear and wan
Reach the gulfs of evening on.

RHYME a a b b

The son of woman turns his brow
West from forty counties now,
And, as the edge of heaven he eyes,
Thinks eternal thoughts, and sighs.

RHYME a a b b

Oh wide's the world, to rest or roam,
With change abroad and cheer at home,
Fights and furloughs, talk and tale,
Company and beef and ale.

RHYME a a b b

But if I front the evening sky
Silent on the west look I,
And my comrade, stride for stride,
Paces silent at my side.

RHYME a a b b

Comrade, look not on the west:
'Twill have the heart out of your breast;
'Twill take your thoughts and sink them far,
Leagues beyond the western bar.

RHYME a a b b

Oh lad, I fear that yon's the sea
Where they fished for you and me,
And there, from whence we both were ta'en,
You and I shall drown again.

RHYME a a b b

Send not on your soul before
To dive from that beguiling shore,
And let not yet the swimmer leave
His clothes upon the sands of eve.

RHYME a a b b

Too fast to yonder strand forlorn
We journey, to the sunken bourn,
To flush the fading tinges eyed
By other lads at eventide.

RHYME a a b b

Wide is the world, to rest or roam,
And early 'tis for turning home:
Plant your heel on earth and stand,
And let's forget our native land.

RHYME a a b b

When you and I are spilt on air
Long we shall be strangers there;
Friends of flesh and bone are best:
Comrade, look not on the west.

TITLE Last Poems, II

RHYME a b c b

As I gird on for fighting
  My sword upon my thigh,
I think on old ill fortunes
  Of better men than I.
 
RHYME a b c b

Think I, the round world over,
  What golden lads are low
With hurts not mine to mourn for
  And shames I shall not know.
 
RHYME a b c b

What evil luck soever
  For me remains in store,
'Tis sure much finer fellows
  Have fared much worse before.
 
RHYME a b c b

So here are things to think on
  That ought to make me brave,
As I strap on for fighting
  My sword that will not save.

TITLE Last Poems, III

RHYME a b c b

Her strong enchantments failing,
  Her towers of fear in wreck,
Her limbecks dried of poisons
  And the knife at her neck,

RHYME a b c b

The Queen of air and darkness
  Begins to shrill and cry,
`O young man, O my slayer
  To-morrow you shall die.'

RHYME a b c b

O Queen of air and darkness
  I think 'tis truth you say,
And I shall die to-morrow;
  But you shall die to-day. 

TITLE Illic Jacet

RHYME a b a b

Oh hard is the bed they have made him,
  And common the blanket and cheap;
But there he will lie as they laid him:
  Where else could you trust him to sleep?
 
RHYME a b a b

To sleep when the bugle is crying
  And cravens have heard and are brave,
When mothers and sweethearts are sighing
  And lads are in love with the grave.
 
RHYME a b a b

Oh dark is the chamber and lonely,
  And lights and companions depart;
But lief will he lose them and only
  Behold the desire of his heart.
 
RHYME a b a b

And low is the roof, but it covers
  A sleeper content to repose;
And far from his friends and his lovers
  He lies with the sweetheart he chose.

TITLE The Grenadier

RHYME a b a b 

The Queen she sent to look for me,
  The sergeant he did say,
`Young man, a soldier will you be
  For thirteen pence a day?'
 
RHYME a b a b 

For thirteen pence a day did I
  Take off the things I wore,
And I have marched to where I lie,
  And I shall march no more.
 
RHYME a b a b 

My mouth is dry, my shirt is wet,
  My blood runs all away,
So now I shall not die in debt
  For thirteen pence a day.
 
RHYME a b a b 

To-morrow after new young men
  The sergeant he must see,
For things will all be over then
  Between the Queen and me.
 
RHYME a b a b 

And I shall have to bate my price,
  For in the grave, they say,
Is neither knowledge nor device
  Nor thirteen pence a day.

TITLE Lancer

RHYME a b a b

I 'listed at home for a lancer,
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
I 'listed at home for a lancer
  To ride on a horse to my grave.
 
RHYME a b a b

And over the seas we were bidden
  A country to take and to keep;
And far with the brave I have ridden,
  And now with the brave I shall sleep.
 
RHYME a b a b

For round me the men will be lying
  That learned me the way to behave,
And showed me my business of dying:
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
 
RHYME a a b

They ask, and there is not an answer;
Says I, I will 'list for a lancer,
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?
 
RHYME a b a b

And I with the brave shall be sleeping
  At ease on my mattress of loam,
When back from their taking and keeping
  The squadron is riding at home.
 
RHYME a b a b

The wind with the plumes will be playing,
  The girls will stand watching them wave,
And eyeing my comrades and saying
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

RHYME a a b
 
They ask, and there is not an answer;
Says you, I will 'list for a lancer,
  Oh who would not sleep with the brave?

TITLE Last Poems, VII

RHYME a b a b

In valleys green and still
  Where lovers wander maying
They hear from over hill
  A music playing.

RHYME a b a b

Behind the drum and fife,
  Past hawthornwood and hollow,
Through earth and out of life
  The soldiers follow.

RHYME a b a b

The soldier's is the trade:
  In any wind or weather
He steals the heart of maid
  And man together.

RHYME a b a b

The lover and his lass
  Beneath the hawthorn lying
Have heard the soldiers pass,
  And both are sighing.

RHYME a b a b

And down the distance they
  With dying note and swelling
Walk the resounding way
  To the still dwelling.

TITLE Last Poems, VIII

RHYME a b a b

Soldier from the wars returning,
  Spoiler of the taken town,
Here is ease that asks not earning;
  Turn you in and sit you down.

RHYME a b a b

Peace is come and wars are over,
  Welcome you and welcome all,
While the charger crops the clover
  And his bridle hangs in stall.

RHYME a b a b

Now no more of winters biting
  Filth in trench from fall to spring,
Summers full of sweat and fighting
  For the Kesar or the King.

RHYME a b a b

Rest you, charger, rust you, bridle;
  Kings and Kesars, keep your pay;
Soldier, sit you down and idle
  At the inn of night for aye.

TITLE Last Poems, IX

RHYME a b a b

The chestnut casts his flambeaux, and the flowers
  Stream from the hawthorn on the wind away,
The doors clap to, the pane is blind with showers.
  Pass me the can, lad; there's an end of May.
 
RHYME a b a b

There's one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot,
  One season ruined of our little store.
May will be fine next year as like as not:
  Oh ay, but then we shall be twenty-four.
 
RHYME a b a b

We for a certainty are not the first
  Have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled
Their hopeful plans to emptiness, and cursed
  Whatever brute and blackguard made the world.
 
RHYME a b a b

It is in truth iniquity on high
  To cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave,
And mar the merriment as you and I
  Fare on our long fool's-errand to the grave.
 
RHYME a b a b

Iniquity it is; but pass the can.
  My lad, no pair of kings our mothers bore;
Our only portion is the estate of man:
  We want the moon, but we shall get no more.
 
RHYME a b a b

If here to-day the cloud of thunder lours
  To-morrow it will hie on far behests;
The flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
  Soon, and the soul will mourn in other breasts.
 
RHYME a b a b

The troubles of our proud and angry dust
  Are from eternity, and shall not fail.
Bear them we can, and if we can we must.
  Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale.

TITLE Last Poems, X

RHYME a b c b

Could man be drunk for ever
  With liquor, love, or fights,
Lief should I rouse at morning
  And lief lie down at nights.
 
RHYME a b c b

But men at whiles are sober
  And think by fits and starts,
And if they think, they fasten
  Their hands upon their hearts.

TITLE Last Poems, XI

RHYME a b a a b

Yonder see the morning blink:
  The sun is up, and up must I,
To wash and dress and eat and drink
And look at things and talk and think
  And work, and God knows why.
 
RHYME a b a a b

Oh often have I washed and dressed
  And what's to show for all my pain?
Let me lie abed and rest:
Ten thousand times I've done my best
  And all's to do again.

TITLE Last Poems, XII

RHYME a a *

  The laws of God, the laws of man,
He may keep that will and can;
Not I: let God and man decree
Laws for themselves and not for me;
And if my ways are not as theirs
Let them mind their own affairs.
Their deeds I judge and much condemn,
Yet when did I make laws for them?
Please yourselves, say I, and they
Need only look the other way.
But no, they will not; they must still
Wrest their neighbour to their will,
And make me dance as they desire
With jail and gallows and hell-fire.
And how am I to face the odds
Of man's bedevilment and God's?
I, a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made.
They will be master, right or wrong;
Though both are foolish, both are strong.
And since, my soul, we cannot fly
To Saturn nor to Mercury,
Keep we must, if keep we can,
These foreign laws of God and man.

TITLE The Deserter

RHYME a b a b

`What sound awakened me, I wonder,
  For now 'tis dumb.'
`Wheels on the road most like, or thunder:
  Lie down; 'twas not the drum.'
 
RHYME a b a b

Toil at sea and two in haven
  And trouble far;
Fly, crow, away, and follow, raven,
  And all that croaks for war.
 
RHYME a b a b

`Hark, I heard the bugle crying,
  And where am I?
My friends are up and dressed and dying,
  And I will dress and die.'
 
RHYME a b a b

`Oh love is rare and trouble plenty
  And carrion cheap,
And daylight dear at four-and-twenty:
  Lie down again and sleep.'
 
RHYME a b a b

`Reach me my belt and leave your prattle:
  Your hour is gone;
But my day is the day of battle,
  And that comes dawning on.
 
RHYME a b a b

`They mow the field of man in season:
  Farewell, my fair,
And, call it truth or call it treason,
  Farewell the vows that were.'
 
RHYME a b a b

`Ay, false heart, forsake me lightly:
  'Tis like the brave.
They find no bed to joy in rightly
  Before they find the grave.
 
RHYME a b a b

`Their love is for their own undoing,
  And east and west
They scour about the world a-wooing
  The bullet to their breast.
 
RHYME a b a b

`Sail away the ocean over,
  Oh sail away,
And lie there with your leaden lover
  For ever and a day.'

TITLE The Culprit

RHYME a b c b b

The night my father got me
  His mind was not on me;
He did not plague his fancy
  To muse if I should be
  The son you see.

RHYME a b c b b

The day my mother bore me
  She was a fool and glad,
For all the pain I cost her,
  That she had borne the lad
  That borne she had.

RHYME a b c b b

My mother and my father
  Out of the light they lie;
The warrant would not find them,
  And here 'tis only I
  Shall hang so high.

RHYME a b c b b

Oh let not man remember
  The soul that God forgot
But fetch the county kerchief
  And noose me in the knot
  And I will rot.

RHYME a b c b b

For so the game is ended
  That should not have begun.
My father and my mother
  They had a likely son,
  And I have none.

TITLE Eight O' Clock

RHYME a b a b

He stood, and heard the steeple
  Sprinkle the quarters on the morning town.
One, two, three, four, to market-place and people
  It tossed them down.
 
RHYME a b a b

Strapped, noosed, nighing his hour,
  He stood and counted them and cursed his luck;
And then the clock collected in the tower
  Its strength, and struck.

TITLE Spring Morning

RHYME a b a b

Star and coronal and bell
  April underfoot renews,
And the hope of man as well
  Flowers among the morning dews.

RHYME a b a b

Now the old come out to look,
  Winter past and winter's pains,
How the sky in pool and brook
  Glitters on the grassy plains.

RHYME a b a b

Easily the gentle air
  Wafts the turning season on;
Things to comfort them are there,
  Though 'tis true the best are gone.

RHYME a b a b

Now the scorned unlucky lad
  Rousing from his pillow gnawn
Mans his heart and deep and glad
  Drinks the valiant air of dawn.

RHYME a b a b

Half the night he longed to die,
  Now are sown on hill and plain
Pleasures worth his while to try
  Ere he longs to die again.

RHYME a b a b

Blue the sky from east to west
  Arches, and the world is wide,
Though the girl he loves the best
  Rouses from another's side.

TITLE Astronomy

RHYME a b a b

The Wain upon the northern steep
  Descends and lifts away.
Oh I will sit me down and weep
  For bones in Africa.
 
RHYME a b a b

For pay and medals, name and rank,
  Things that he has not found,
He hove the Cross to heaven and sank
  The pole-star underground.
 
RHYME a b a b

And now he does not even see
  Signs of the nadir roll
At night over the ground where he
  Is buried with the pole.

TITLE Last Poems, XVIII

RHYME a b c c b

The rain, it streams on stone and hillock,
  The boot clings to the clay.
Since all is done that's due and right
Let's home; and now, my lad, good-night,
  For I must turn away.
 
RHYME a b c c b

Good-night, my lad, for nought's eternal;
  No league of ours, for sure.
To-morrow I shall miss you less,
And ache of heart and heaviness
  Are things that time should cure.
 
RHYME a b c c b

Over the hill the highway marches
  And what's beyond is wide:
Oh soon enough will pine to nought
Remembrance and the faithful thought
  That sits the grave beside.
 
RHYME a b c c b

The skies, they are not always raining
  Nor grey the twelvemonth through;
And I shall meet good days and mirth,
And range the lovely lands of earth
  With friends no worse than you.
 
RHYME a b c c b

But oh, my man, the house is fallen
  That none can build again;
My man, how full of joy and woe
Your mother bore you years ago
  To-night to lie in the rain.

TITLE Last Poems, XIX

RHYME a b c b

In midnights of November,
  When Dead Man's Fair is nigh,
And danger in the valley,
  And anger in the sky,

RHYME a b c b

Around the huddling homesteads
  The leafless timber roars,
And the dead call the dying
  And finger at the doors.

RHYME a b c b

Oh, yonder faltering fingers
  Are hands I used to hold;
Their false companion drowses
  And leaves them in the cold.

RHYME a b c b

Oh, to the bed of ocean,
  To Africk and to Ind,
I will arise and follow
  Along the rainy wind.

RHYME a b c b

The night goes out and under
  With all its train forlorn;
Hues in the east assemble
  And cocks crow up the morn.

RHYME a b c b

The living are the living
  And dead the dead will stay,
And I will sort with comrades
  That face the beam of day.

TITLE Last Poems, XX

RHYME a b c a b c

The night is freezing fast,
  To-morrow comes December;
    And winterfalls of old
Are with me from the past;
  And chiefly I remember
    How Dick would hate the cold.
 
RHYME a b c a b c

Fall, winter, fall; for he,
  Prompt hand and headpiece clever,
    Has woven a winter robe,
And made of earth and sea
  His overcoat for ever,
    And wears the turning globe.

TITLE Last Poems, XXI

RHYME a b a b

The fairies break their dances
  And leave the printed lawn,
And up from India glances
  The silver sail of dawn.

RHYME a b a b

The candles burn their sockets,
  The blinds let through the day,
The young man feels his pockets
  And wonders what's to pay.

TITLE Lost Poems, XXII

RHYME a b a b

The sloe was lost in flower,
  The April elm was dim;
That was the lover's hour,
  The hour for lies and him.
 
RHYME a b a b

If thorns are all the bower,
  If north winds freeze the fir,
Why, 'tis another's hour,
  The hour for truth and her.

TITLE Lost Poems, XXII

RHYME a b c b

In the morning, in the morning,
  In the happy field of hay,
Oh they looked at one another
  By the light of day.

In the blue and silver morning
  On the haycock as they lay,
Oh they looked at one another
  And they looked away.

TITLE Epithalium

RHYME a a *

  He is here, Urania's son,
Hymen come from Helicon;
God that glads the lover's heart,
He is here to join and part.
So the groomsman quits your side
And the bridegroom seeks the bride:
Friend and comrade yield you o'er
To her that hardly loves you more.

RHYME a a *

  Now the sun his skyward beam
Has tilted from the Ocean stream.
Light the Indies, laggard sun:
Happy bridegroom, day is done,
And the star from $(C(+(Bta's steep
Calls to bed but not to sleep.

RHYME a a *

  Happy bridegroom, Hesper brings
All desired and timely things.
All whom morning sends to roam,
Hesper loves to lead them home.
Home return who him behold,
Child to mother, sheep to fold,
Bird to nest from wandering wide:
Happy bridegroom, seek your bride.

RHYME a a *

  Pour it out, the golden cup
Given and guarded, brimming up,
Safe through jostling markets borne
And the thicket of the thorn;
Folly spurned and danger past,
Pour it to the god at last.

RHYME a a *

  Now, to smother noise and light
Is stolen abroad the wildering night,
And the blotting shades confuse
Path and meadow full of dews;
And the high heavens, that all control,
Turn in silence round the pole.
Catch the starry beams they shed
Prospering the married bed,
And breed the land that reared your prime
Sons to stay the rot of time.
All is quiet, no alarms;
Nothing fear of nightly harms.
Safe you sleep on guarded ground,
And in silent circle round
The thoughts of friends keep watch and ward,
Harnessed angels, hand on sword.

TITLE The Oracles

RHYME a b a b

'Tis mute, the word they went to hear on high Dodona mountain
  When winds were in the oakenshaws and all the cauldrons tolled,
And mute's the midland navel-stone beside the singing fountain,
  And echoes list to silence now where gods told lies of old.
 
RHYME a b a b

I took my question to the shrine that has not ceased from speaking,
  The heart within, that tells the truth and tells it twice as plain;
And from the cave of oracles I heard the priestess shrieking
  That she and I should surely die and never live again.
 
RHYME a b a b

Oh priestess, what you cry is clear, and sound good sense I think it;
  But let the screaming echoes rest, and froth your mouth no more.
'Tis true there's better boose than brine, but he that drowns must drink it;
  And oh, my lass, the news is news that men have heard before.
 
RHYME a b a b

The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning;
  Their fighters drink the rivers up, their shafts benight the air,
And he that stands will die for nought, and home there's no returning.
  The Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair.

TITLE Last Poems, XXVI

RHYME a b a b

The half-moon westers low, my love,
  And the wind brings up the rain;
And wide apart lie we, my love,
  And seas between the twain.
 
RHYME a b a b

I know not if it rains, my love,
  In the land where you do lie;
And oh, so sound you sleep, my love,
  You know no more than I.

TITLE Last Poems, XXVII

RHYME a b a b

The sigh that heaves the grasses
  Whence thou wilt never rise
Is of the air that passes
  And knows not if it sighs.

RHYME a b a b

The diamond tears adorning
  Thy low mound on the lea,
Those are the tears of morning,
  That weeps, but not for thee.

TITLE Last Poems, XXVIII

RHYME a b a b

Now dreary dawns the eastern light,
  And fall of eve is drear,
And cold the poor man lies at night,
  And so goes out the year.
 
RHYME a b a b

Little is the luck I've had,
  And oh, 'tis comfort small
To think that many another lad
  Has had no luck at all.

TITLE Last Poems XXIX

RHYME a b c c a b d d

Wake not for the world-heard thunder
  Not the chime that earthquakes toll.
Star may plot in heaven with planet,
Lightning rive the rock of granite,
Tempest tread the oakwood under:
  Fear you not for flesh nor soul.
Marching, fighting, victory past,
Stretch your limbs in peace at last.
 
RHYME a b c c a b d d

Stir not for the soldiers drilling
  Nor the fever nothing cures:
Throb of drum and timbal's rattle
Call but man alive to battle,
And the fife with death-notes filling
  Screams for blood but not for yours.
Times enough you bled your best;
Sleep on now, and take your rest.
 
RHYME a b c c a b d d

Sleep, my lad; the French are landed,
  London's burning, Windsor's down;
Clasp your cloak of earth about you,
We must man the ditch without you,
March unled and fight short-handed,
  Charge to fall and swim to drown.
Duty, friendship, bravery o'er,
Sleep away, lad; wake no more.

TITLE Sinner's Rue

RHYME a b c b

I walked alone and thinking,
  And faint the night wind blew
And stirred on mounds at crossways
  The flower of sinner's rue.

RHYME a b c b

Where the roads part they bury
  Him that his own hand slays,
And so the weed of sorrow
  Springs at the four cross ways.

RHYME a b c b

By night I plucked it hueless,
  When morning broke 'twas blue:
Blue at my breast I fastened
  The flower of sinner's rue.

RHYME a b c b

It seemed a herb of healing,
  A balsam and a sign,
Flower of a heart whose trouble
  Must have been worse than mine.

RHYME a b c b

Dead clay that did me kindness,
  I can do none to you,
But only wear for breastknot
  The flower of sinner's rue.

TITLE Hell's Gate

RHYME a a *

  Onward led the road again
Through the sad uncoloured plain
Under twilight brooding dim,
And along the utmost rim
Wall and rampart risen to sight
Cast a shadow not of night,
And beyond them seemed to glow
Bonfires lighted long ago.
And my dark conductor broke
Silence at my side and spoke,
Saying, `You conjecture well:
Yonder is the gate of hell.'

RHYME a a *

  Ill as yet the eye could see
The eternal masonry,
But beneath it on the dark
To and fro there stirred a spark.
And again the sombre guide
Knew my question, and replied:
`At hell gate the damned in turn
Pace for sentinel and burn.'

RHYME a a *

  Dully at the leaden sky
Staring, and with idle eye
Measuring the listless plain,
I began to think again.
Many things I thought of then,
Battle, and the loves of men,
Cities entered, oceans crossed,
Knowledge gained and virtue lost,
Cureless folly done and said,
And the lovely way that led
To the slimepit and the mire
And the everlasting fire.
And against a smoulder dun
And a dawn without a sun
Did the nearing bastion loom,
And across the gate of gloom
Still one saw the sentry go,
Trim and burning, to and fro,
One for women to admire
In his finery of fire.
Something, as I watched him pace,
Minded me of time and place,
Soldiers of another corps
And a sentry known before.

RHYME a a *

  Ever darker hell on high
Reared its strength upon the sky,
And our footfall on the track
Fetched the daunting echo back.
But the soldier pacing still
The insuperable sill,
Nursing his tormented pride,
Turned his head to neither side,
Sunk into himself apart
And the hell-fire of his heart.
But against our entering in
From the drawbridge Death and Sun
Rose to render key and sword
To their father and their lord.
And the portress foul to see
Lifted up her eyes on me,
Smiling, and I made reply:
`Met again, my lass,' said I.
Then the sentry turned his head,
Looked, and knew me, and was Ned.

RHYME a a *

  Once he looked, and halted straight,
Set his back against the gate,
Caught his musket to his chin,
While the hive of hell within
Sent abroad a seething hum
As of towns whose king is come
Leading conquest home from far
And the captives of his war,
And the car of triumph waits,
And they open wide the gates.
But across the entry barred
Straddled the revolted guard,
Weaponed and accoutred well
From the arsenals of hell;
And beside him, sick and white,
Sin to left and Death to right
Turned a countenance of fear
On the flaming mutineer.
Over us the darkness bowed,
And the anger in the cloud
Clenched the lightning for the stroke;
But the traitor musket spoke.

RHYME a a *

  And the hollowness of hell
Sounded as its master fell,
And the mourning echo rolled
Ruin through his kingdom old.
Tyranny and terror flown
Left a pair of friends alone,
And beneath the nether sky
All that stirred was he and I.

RHYME a a *

  Silent, nothing found to say,
We began the backward way;
And the ebbing lustre died
From the soldier at my side,
As in all his spruce attire
Failed the everlasting fire.
Midmost of the homeward track
Once we listened and looked back;
But the city, dusk and mute,
Slept, and there was no pursuit.

TITLE Last Poems, XXXIII

RHYME a b c b d e f e

When I would muse in boyhood
  The wild green woods among,
And nurse resolves and fancies
  Because the world was young,
It was not foes to conquer,
  Nor sweethearts to be kind,
But it was friends to die for
  That I would seek and find.

RHYME a b c b d e f e

I sought them and I found them,
  The sure, the straight, the brave,
The hearts I lost my own to,
  The souls I could not save.
They braced their belts around them,
  They crossed in ships the sea,
They sought and found six feet of ground,
  And there they died for me.

TITLE Last Poems, XXXIV

RHYME a b a b

When the eye of day is shut,
  And the stars deny their beams,
And about the forest hut
  Blows the roaring wood of dreams,

RHYME a b a b

From deep clay, from desert rock,
  From the sunk sands of the main,
Come not at my door to knock,
  Hearts that loved me not again.

RHYME a b a b

Sleep, be still, turn to your rest
  In the lands where you are laid;
In far lodgings east and west
  Lie down on the beds you made.

RHYME a b a b

In gross marl, in blowing dust,
  In the drowned ooze of the sea,
Where you would not, lie you must,
  Lie you must, and not with me.

TITLE The First of May

RHYME a b a b c d c d

The orchards half the way
  From home to Ludlow fair
Flowered on the first of May
  In Mays when I was there;
And seen from stile or turning
  The plume of smoke would show
Where fires were burning
  That went out long ago.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

The plum broke forth in green,
  The pear stood high and snowed,
My friends and I between
  Would take the Ludlow road;
Dressed to the nines and drinking
  And light in heart and limb,
And each chap thinking
  The fair was held for him.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Between the trees in flower
  New friends at fairtime tread
The way where Ludlow tower
  Stands planted on the dead.
Our thoughts, a long while after,
  They think, our words they say;
Theirs now's the laughter,
  The fair, the first of May.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Ay, yonder lads are yet
  The fools that we were then;
For oh, the sons we get
  Are still the sons of men.
The sumless tale of sorrow
  Is all unrolled in vain:
May comes to-morrow
  And Ludlow fair again.

TITLE Last Poems, XXXV

RHYME a b a b

When first my way to fair I took
  Few pence in purse had I,
And long I used to stand and look
  At things I could not buy.

RHYME a b a b

Now times are altered: if I care
  To buy a thing, I can;
The pence are here and here's the fair,
  But where's the lost young man?

RHYME a b a b

-- To think that two and two are four
  And neither five nor three
The heart of man has long been sore
  And long 'tis like to be.

TITLE Revolution

RHYME a b a b

West and away the wheels of darkness roll,
  Day's beamy banner up the east is borne,
Spectres and fears, the nightmare and her foal,
  Drown in the golden deluge of the morn.
 
RHYME a b a b

But over sea and continent from sight
  Safe to the Indies has the earth conveyed
The vast and moon-eclipsing cone of night,
  Her towering foolscap of eternal shade.
 
RHYME a b a b

See, in mid heaven the sun is mounted; hark,
  The belfries tingle to the noonday chime.
'Tis silent, and the subterranean dark
  Has crossed the nadir, and begins to climb.

TITLE EPITAPH ON AN ARMY OF MERCENARIES

RHYME a b a b

These, in the day when heaven was falling,
  The hour when Earth's foundations fled,
Followed their mercenary calling
  And took their wages and are dead.
 
RHYME a b a b

Their shoulders held the sky suspended;
  They stood, and earth's foundations stay;
What God abandoned, these defended,
  And saved the sum of things for pay.

TITLE Last Poems, XXXVIII

RHYME a b c c b

Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough
  The land and not the sea,
And leave the soldiers at their drill,
And all about the idle hill
  Shepherd your sheep with me.

RHYME a b c c b

Oh stay with company and mirth
  And daylight and the air;
Too full already is the grave
Of fellows that were good and brave
  And died because they were.

TITLE Last Poems, XXXIX

RHYME a b c b b

When summer's end is nighing
  And skies at evening cloud,
I muse on change and fortune
  And all the feats I vowed
  When I was young and proud.

RHYME a b c b b

The weathercock at sunset
  Would lose the slanted ray,
And I would climb the beacon
  That looked to Wales away
  And saw the last of day.

RHYME a b c b b

From hill and cloud and heaven
  The hues of evening died;
Night welled through lane and hollow
  And hushed the countryside,
  But I had youth and pride.

RHYME a b c b b

And I with earth and nightfall
  In converse high would stand,
Late, till the west was ashen
  And darkness hard at hand,
  And the eye lost the land.

RHYME a b c b b

The year might age, and cloudy
  The lessening day might close,
But air of other summers
  Breathed from beyond the snows,
  And I had hope of those.

RHYME a b c b b

They came and were and are not
  And come no more anew;
And all the years and seasons
  That ever can ensue
  Must now be worse and few.

RHYME a b c b b

So here's an end of roaming
  On eves when autumn nighs:
The ear too fondly listens
  For summer's parting sighs,
  And then the heart replies.

TITLE Last Poems, XL

RHYME a b c b d b

Tell me not here, it needs not saying,
  What tune the enchantress plays
In aftermaths of soft September
  Or under blanching mays,
For she and I were long acquainted
  And I knew all her ways.
 
RHYME a b c b d b

On russet floors, by waters idle,
  The pine lets fall its cone;
The cuckoo shouts all day at nothing
  In leafy dells alone;
And traveller's joy beguiles in autumn
  Hearts that have lost their own.
 
RHYME a b c b d b

On acres of the seeded grasses
  The changing burnish heaves;
Or marshalled under moons of harvest
  Stand still all night the sheaves;
Or beeches strip in storms for winter
  And stain the wind with leaves.
 
RHYME a b c b d b

Possess, as I possessed a season,
  The countries I resign,
Where over elmy plains the highway
  Would mount the hills and shine,
And full of shade the pillared forest
  Would murmur and be mine.
 
RHYME a b c b d b

For nature, heartless, witless nature,
  Will neither care nor know
What stranger's feet may find the meadow
  And trespass there and go,
Nor ask amid the dews of morning
  If they are mine or no.

TITLE Fancy's Knell

RHYME a b a b c d c d

When lads were home from labour
  At Abdon under Clee,
A man would call his neighbour
  And both would send for me.
And where the light in lances
  Across the mead was laid,
There to the dances,
  I fetched my flute and played.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Ours were idle pleasures,
  Yet oh, content we were,
The young to wind the measures,
  The old to heed the air;
And I to lift with playing
  From tree and tower and steep
The light delaying,
  And flute the sun to sleep.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

The youth toward his fancy,
  Would turn his brow of tan,
And Tom would pair with Nancy
  And Dick step off with Fan;
The girl would lift her glances
  To his, and both be mute:
Well went the dances
  At evening to the flute.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Wenlock Edge was umbered,
  And bright was Abdon Burf,
And warm between them slumbered
  The smooth green miles of turf;
Until from grass and clover
  The upshot beam would fade,
And England over
  Advanced the lofty shade.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

The lofty shade advances,
  I fetch my flute and play:
Come, lads, and learn the dances
  And praise the tune to-day.
To-morrow, more's the pity,
  Away we both must hie,
To air the ditty,
  And to earth I.

TITLE Easter Hymn

RHYME a a *

If in that Syrian garden, ages slain,
You sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,
Nor even in dreams behold how dark and bright
Ascends in smoke and fire by day and night
The hate you died to quench and could but fan,
Sleep well and see no morning, son of man.
 
RHYME a a *

But if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,
At the right hand of majesty on high
You sit, and sitting so remember yet
Your tears, your agony and bloody sweat,
Your cross and passion and the life you gave,
Bow hither out of heaven and see and save.

TITLE More Poems, II

RHYME a b a b

When Israel out of Egypt came
  Safe in the sea they trod;
By day in cloud, by night in flame,
  Went on before them God.
 
RHYME a b a b

He brought them with a stretched out hand
  Dry-footed through the foam,
Past sword and famine, rock and sand,
  Lust and rebellion, home.
 
RHYME a b a b

I never over Horeb heard
  The blast of advent blow;
No fire-faced prophet brought me word
  Which way behoved me go.
 
RHYME a b a b

Ascended is the cloudy flame,
  The mount of thunder dumb;
The tokens that to Israel came,
  To me they have not come.
 
RHYME a b a b

I see the country far away
  Where I shall never stand;
The heart goes where no footstep may
  Into the promised land.
 
RHYME a b a b

The realm I look upon and die
  Another man will own;
He shall attain the heaven that I
  Perish and have not known.
 
RHYME a b a b

But I will go where they are hid
  That never were begot,
To my inheritance amid
  The nation that is not.

TITLE More Poems, III

RHYME a b a b

For these of old the trader
  Unpearled the Indian seas,
The nations of the nadir
  Were diamondless for these;
 
RHYME a b a b

A people prone and haggard
  Beheld their lightnings hurled:
All round, like Sinai, staggered
  The sceptre-shaken world.
 
RHYME a b a b

But now their coins are tarnished,
  Their towers decayed away,
Their kingdom swept and garnished
  For haler kings than they;
 
RHYME a b a b

Their arms the rust hath eaten,
  Their statutes none regard:
Arabia shall not sweeten
  Their dust, with all her nard.
 
RHYME a b a b

They cease from long vexation,
  Their nights, their days are done,
The pale, the perished nation
  That never see the sun;
 
RHYME a b a b

From the old deep-dusted annals
  The years erase their tale,
And round them race the channels
  That take no second sail.

RHYME a b a b

O youth whose heart is right,
  Whose loins are girt to gain
The hell-defended height
  Where Virtue beckons plain;

RHYME a b a b

Who seest the stark array
  And hast not stayed to count
But singly wilt assay
  The many-cannoned mount:

RHYME a b a b

Well is thy war begun;
  Endure, be strong and strive;
But think not, O my son,
  To save thy soul alive.

RHYME a b a b

Wilt thou be true and just
  And clean and kind and brave?
Well; but for all thou dost,
  Be sure it shall not save.

RHYME a b a b

Thou, when the night falls deep,
  Thou, though the mount be won,
High heart, thou shalt but sleep
  The sleep denied to none.

RHYME a b a b

Others, or ever thou,
  To scale those heights were sworn;
And some achieved, but now
  They never see the morn.

RHYME a b a b

How shouldst thou keep the prize?
  Thou wast not born for aye.
Content thee if thine eyes
  Behold it in thy day.

RHYME a b a b

O youth that wilt attain,
  On, for thine hour is short.
It may be thou shalt gain
  The hell-defended fort.

TITLE More Poems, V

RHYME a b a b

The snows are fled away, leaves on the shaws
  And grasses in the mead renew their birth,
The river to the river-bed withdraws,
  And altered is the fashion of the earth.

RHYME a b a b

The Nymphs and Graces three put off their fear
  And unapparelled in the woodland play.
The swift hour and the brief prime of the year
  Say to the soul, Thou wast not born for aye.

RHYME a b a b

Thaw follows frost; hard on the heel of spring
  Treads summer sure to die, for hard on hers
Comes autumn, with his apples scattering;
  Then back to wintertide, when nothing stirs.

RHYME a b a b

But oh, whate'er the sky-led seasons mar,
  Moon upon moon rebuilds it with her beams:
Come we where Tullus and where Ancus are,
  And good Aeneas, we are dust and dreams.

RHYME a b a b

Torquatus, if the gods in heaven shall add
  The morrow to the day, what tongue has told?
Feast then thy heart, for what thy heart has had
  The fingers of no heir will ever hold.

RHYME a b a b

When thou descendest once the shades among,
  The stern assize and equal judgment o'er,
Not thy long lineage nor thy golden tongue,
  No, nor thy righteousness, shall friend thee more.

RHYME a b a b

Night holds Hippolytus the pure of stain,
  Diana steads him nothing, he must stay;
And Theseus leaves PirithoN|s in the chain
  The love of comrades cannot take away.

RHYME a b b c d e e c

I to my perils
  Of cheat and charmer
  Came clad in armour
    By stars benign.
Hope lies to mortals
  And most believe her
  But man's deceiver
    Was never mine.

RHYME a b b c d e e c

The thoughts of others
  Were light and fleeting,
  Of lovers' meeting
    Or luck or fame.
Mine were of trouble,
  And mine were steady,
  So I was ready
    When trouble came.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Stars, I have seen them fall,
  But when they drop and die
No star is lost at all
  From all the star-sown sky.
The toil of all that be
  Helps not the primal fault;
It rains into the sea,
  And still the sea is salt.

TITLE More Poems, VIII

RHYME a b a b

Give me a land of boughs in leaf,
  A land of trees that stand;
Where trees are fallen, there is grief;
  I love no leafless land.

RHYME a b a b

Alas, the country whence I fare,
  It is where I would stay;
And where I would not, it is there
  That I shall be for aye.

RHYME a b a b

And one remembers and forgets
  But 'tis not found again,
Not though they hale in crimsoned nets
  The sunset from the main.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

When green buds hang in the elm like dust
  And sprinkle the lime like rain,
Forth I wander, forth I must,
  And drink of life again.
Forth I must by hedgerow bowers
  To look at the leaves uncurled,
And stand in the fields where cuckoo-flowers
  Are lying about the world.

The weeping Pleiads wester,
  And the moon is under sea;
From bourn to bourn of midnight
  Far sighs the rainy breeze:

It sighs from a lost country
  To a land I have not known;
The weeping Pleiads wester,
  And I lie down alone.

TITLE More Poems, XI

RHYME a b c b

The rainy Pleiads wester,
  Orion plunges prone,
The stroke of midnight ceases,

The rainy Pleiads wester
  And seek beyond the sea
The head that I shall dream of,
  And 'twill not dream of me.

RHYME a b a b

I promise nothing: friends will part;
  All things may end, for all began;
And truth and singleness of heart

But this unlucky love should last
  When answered passions thin to air;
Eternal fate so deep has cast
  Its sure foundation of despair.

RHYME a b c b

I lay me down and slumber
  And every morn revive.
Whose is the night-long breathing
  That keeps a man alive?

RHYME a b c b

When I was off to dreamland
  And left my limbs forgot,
Who stayed at home to mind them,
  And breathed when I did not?

-- I waste my time in talking,
  No heed at all takes he,
My kind and foolish comrade
  That breathes all night for me.

The farms of home lie lost in even,
  I see far off the steeple stand;
West and away from here to heaven
  Still is the land.

RHYME a b a b

There if I go no girl will greet me,
  No comrade hollo from the hill,
No dog run down the yard to meet me:
  The land is still.

The land is still by farm and steeple,
  And still for me the land may stay:
There I was friends with perished people,
  And there lie they.

How clear, how lovely bright,

Up from the eastern sea

RHYME a a b c c c b

To-day I shall be strong,
No more shall yield to wrong,

Days lost, I know not how,

Now I shall keep the vow

RHYME a a b c c c b

Ensanguining the skies
How heavily it dies

Soon will evening's self be gone

Though the whispering night were still,

Delight it is in youth and May

'Tis made, and here I am in hell.
My hand, though now my knuckles bleed,

Some have suffered more than I,
Who only spend the night alone

The put to death, the perished nation,

Are the two trades of man; and which is worse
I know not, but I know that both are ill.

He, standing hushed, a pace or two apart,
  Among the bluebells of the listless plain,
Thinks, and remembers how he cleansed his heart
  And washed his hands in innocence in vain.

From the wash the laundress sends
My collars home with ravelled ends:
I must fit, now these are frayed,
My neck with new ones London-made.

RHYME a a b b

Homespun collars, homespun hearts,
Wear to rags in foreign parts.
Mine at least's as good as done,
And I must get a London one.

Shake hands, we shall never be friends, all's over;
  I only vex you the more I try.
All's wrong that ever I've done or said,
And nought to help it in this dull head:
  Shake hands, here's luck, good-bye.
 
RHYME a b c c b

But if you come to a road where danger
  Or guilt or anguish or shame's to share,
Be good to the lad that loves you true
And the soul that was born to die for you,
  And whistle and I'll be there.

TITLE More Poems, XXXI

RHYME a b c b

Because I liked you better
  Than suits a man to say,
It irked you, and I promised
  To throw the thought away.
 
RHYME a b c b

To put the world between us
  We parted, stiff and dry;
`Good-bye,' said you, `forget me.'
  `I will, no fear', said I.
 
RHYME a b c b

If here, where clover whitens
  The dead man's knoll, you pass,
And no tall flower to meet you
  Starts in the trefoiled grass,
 
RHYME a b c b

Halt by the headstone naming
  The heart no longer stirred,
And say the lad that loved you
  Was one that kept his word.

With seed the sowers scatter
  The furrows as they go;
Poor lads, 'tis little matter
  How many sorts they sow,
  For only one will grow.

RHYME a b a b b

The charlock on the fallow
  Will take the traveller's eyes,
And gild the ploughland sallow
  With flowers before it dies.
  But twice 'twill not arise.

RHYME a b a b b

The stinging nettle only
  Will still be found to stand:
The numberless, the lonely,
  The thronger of the land,
  The leaf that hurts the hand.

RHYME a b a b b

It thrives, come sun, come showers,
  Blow east, blow west, it springs;
It peoples towns, and towers
  About the courts of Kings,
  And touch it and it stings.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

On forelands high in heaven,
  'Tis many a year gone by,
Amidst the fall of even
  Would stand my friends and I.
Before our foolish faces
  Lay lands we did not see;
Our eyes were in the places
  Where we should never be.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

`Oh, the pearl seas are yonder,
  The amber-sanded short;
Shires where the girls are fonder,
  Towns where the pots hold more.
And here fret we and moulder
  By grange and rick and shed
And every moon are older,
  And soon we shall be dead.'

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Heigho, 'twas true and pity;
  But there we lads must stay.
Troy was a steepled city,
  But Troy was far away.
And round we turned lamenting
  To homes we longed to leave,
And silent hills indenting
  The orange band of eve.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

I see the air benighted
  And all the dusking dales,
And lamps in England lighted,
  And evening wrecked on Wales;
And starry darkness paces
  The road from sea to sea,
And blots the foolish faces
  Of my poor friends and me.

Young is the blood that yonder
  Strides out the dusty mile,
And breasts the hillside highway
  And whistles loud the while,
  And vaults the stile.

RHYME a b c b b

Yet flesh, now too, has thorn-pricks,
  And shoulders carry care,
Even as in other seasons,
  When I and not my heir
  Was young and there.

RHYME a b c b b

On miry meads in winter
  The football sprang and fell;
May stuck the land with wickets:
  For all the eye could tell,
  The world went well.

RHYME a b c b b

Yet well, God knows, it went not,
  God knows, it went awry;
For me, one flowery Maytime,
  It went so ill that I
  Designed to die.

RHYME a b c b b

And if so long I carry
  The lot that season marred,
'Tis that the sons of Adam
  Are not so evil-starred
  As they are hard.

RHYME a b c b b

Young is the blood that yonder
  Succeeds to rick and fold,
Fresh are the form and favour
  And new the minted mould:
  The thoughts are old.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

Half-way, for one commandment broken,
  The woman made her endless halt,
And she to-day, a glistering token,
  Stands in the wilderness of salt.
Behind, the vats of judgment brewing
  Thundered, and thick the brimstone snowed;
He to the hill of his undoing
  Pursued his road.

TITLE More Poems, XXXVI

RHYME a b a b

Here dead lie we because we did not choose
  To live and shame the land from which we sprung.
Life, to be sure, is nothing much to lose;
  But young men think it is, and we were young.

RHYME a b c b

I did not lose my heart in summer's even,
  When roses to the moonrise burst apart:
When plumes were under heel and lead was flying,
  In blood and smoke and flame I lost my heart.

RHYME a b c b

I lost it to a soldier and a foeman,
  A chap that did not kill me, but he tried;
That took the sabre straight, and took it striking
  And laughed and kissed his hand to me and died.

Her hands are filled with slumber

Yet those are more in number

Now who sees night for ever,

Night and no moon and never

My dreams are of a field afar

There in their graves my comrades are,

I too was taught the trade of man
  And spelt the lesson plain;
But they, when I forgot and ran,
  Remembered and remain.

Farewell to a name and a number
  Recalled again
To darkness and silence and slumber

RHYME a b a b

So ceases and turns to the thing
  He was born to be
A soldier cheap to the King
  And dear to me;
 
RHYME a b a b

So smothers in blood the burning
  And flaming flight
Of valour and truth returning
  To dust and night.

He looked at me with eyes I thought

The voice he begged for pence with brought

Oh no, lad, never touch your cap;
  It is not my half-crown:
You have it from a better chap
  That long ago lay down.

RHYME a b a b

Turn east and over Thames to Kent
  And come to the sea's brim,
And find his everlasting tent
  And touch your cap to him.

When he's returned I'll tell him -- oh,
  Dear fellow, I forgot:
Time was you would have cared to know,
  But now it matters not.

RHYME a b a b

I mourn you, and you heed not how;
  Unsaid the word must stay;
Last month was time enough, but now
  The news must keep for aye.

RHYME a b a b

Oh, many a month before I learn
  Will find me starting still
And listening, as the days return,
  For him that never will.

RHYME a b a b

Strange, strange to think his blood is cold
  And mine flows easy on:
And that straight look, that heart of gold,
  That grace, that manhood gone.

RHYME a b a b

The word unsaid will stay unsaid
  Though there was much to say;
Last month was time enough: he's dead,
  The news must keep for aye.

I wake from dreams and turning
  My vision on the height
I scan the beacons burning
  About the fields of night.

RHYME a b a b

Each in its stedfast station
  Inflaming heaven they flare;
They sign with conflagration
  The empty moors of air.

RHYME a b a b

The signal-fires of warning
  They blaze, but none regard;
And on through night to morning
  The world runs ruinward.

Far known to sea and shore,
  Foursquare and founded well,
A thousand years it bore,
  And then the belfry fell.
    The steersman of Triest
    Looked where his mark should be,
    But empty was the west
    And Venice under sea.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

From dusty wreck dispersed
  Its stature mounts amain;
On surer foot than first
  The belfry stands again.
    At to-fall of the day
    Again its curfew tolls
    And burdens far away
    The green and sanguine shoals.

RHYME a b a b c d c d

It looks to north and south,
  It looks to east and west;
It guides to Lido mouth
  The steersman of Triest.
    Andrea, fare you well;
    Venice, farewell to thee.
    The tower that stood and fell
    Is not rebuilt in me.

Smooth between sea and land
Is laid the yellow sand,
And here through summer days
The seed of Adam plays.

RHYME a a b b

Here the child comes to found
His unremaining mound,
And the grown lad to score
Two names upon the shore.

RHYME a a b b

Here, on the level sand,
Between the sea and land,
What shall I build or write
Against the fall of night?

RHYME a a b b

Tell me of runes to grave
That hold the bursting wave,
Or bastions to design
For longer date than mine.

RHYME a a b b

Shall it be Troy or Rome
I fence against the foam,
Or my own name, to stay
When I depart for aye?

RHYME a a b b c c

Nothing: too near at hand,
Planing the figure sand,
Effacing clean and fast
Cities not built to last
And charms devised in vain,
Pours the confounding main.

RHYME  a b c b

Hearken, landsmen, hearken, seamen,
  to the tale of grief and me,
Looking from the land of Biscay

RHYME  a b c b d e f e g h i h

Looking from the land of Biscay
  over Ocean to the sky
On the far-beholding foreland
  paced at even grief and I.
There, as warm the west was burning
  and the east uncoloured cold,
Down the waterway of sunset
  drove to shore a ship of gold.
Gold of mast and gold of cordage,
  gold of sail to sight was she,
And she glassed her ensign golden
  in the waters of the sea.

RHYME  a b c b d e f e

Oh, said I, my friend and lover,
  take we now that ship and sail
Outward in the ebb of hues and
  steer upon the sunset trail;
Leave the night to fall behind us
  and the clouding counties leave:
Help for you and me is yonder,
  in a haven west of eve.

RHYME  a b c b d e f e g h i h

Under hill she neared the harbour
  till the gazer could behold
On the golden deck the steersman
  standing at the helm of gold,
Man and ship and sky and water
  burning in a single flame;
And the mariner of Ocean,
  he was calling as he came:
From the highway of the sunset
  he was shouting on the sea,
`Landsman of the land of Biscay,
  have you help for grief and me?'

RHYME  a b c b d e f e 

When I heard I did not answer,
  I stood mute and shook my heat:
Son of earth and son of Ocean,
  much we thought and nothing said.
Grief and I abode the nightfall,
  to the sunset grief and he
Turned them from the land of Biscay
  on the waters of the sea.

O thou that from thy mansion
  Through time and place to roam,
Dost send abroad thy children,
  And then dost call them home,
 
RHYME a b c b

That men and tribes and nations
  And all thy hand hath made
May shelter them from sunshine
  In thine eternal shade:
 
RHYME a b c b

We now to peace and darkness
  And earth and thee restore
Thy creature that thou madest

RHYME a a b c c b

Good-night; ensured release,
Imperishable peace,
  Have these for yours,
While sea abides, and land,
And earth's foundations stand,
  And heaven endures.

RHYME a a b c c b

When earth's foundations flee,
Nor sky nor land nor sea
  At all is found,
Content you, let them burn:
It is not your concern;
  Sleep on, sleep sound.

RHYME a b a b

`King, the star that shuts the even
  Calls the sheep from Tmolus down;
Home return the doves from heaving,
  And the prince to Sardis town.'

RHYME a b a b

From the hunting heavy laden
  Up the Mysian road they ride;
And the star that mates the maiden
  Leads his son to Croesus' side.

`Lydians, under stream and fountain
  Finders of the golden vein,
Riding from Olympus mountain,
  Lydians, see you Atys plain?'

`King, I see the Phrygian stranger
  And the guards in hunter's trim,
Saviours of thy son from danger;
  Them I see. I see not him.'

RHYME a b a b

`Lydians, as the troop advances,
  -- It is eve and I am old --
Tell me why they trail their lances,
  Washers of the sands of gold.

RHYME a b a b

`I am old and day is ending
  And the wildering night comes on;
Up the Mysian entry wending,
  Lydians, Lydians, what is yon?'

RHYME a b a b

Hounds behind their master whining,
  Huntsmen pacing dumb beside,
On his breast the boar-spear shining,
  Home they bear his father's pride.

TITLE Additional Poems, II

RHYME a b a b

Oh were he and I together,
  Shipmates on the fleeted main,
Sailing through the summer weather
  To the spoil of France or Spain.

RHYME a b a b

Oh were he and I together,
  Locking hands and taking leave,
Low upon the trampled heather
  In the battle lost at eve.

RHYME a b a b

Now are he and I asunder
  And asunder to remain;
Kingdoms are for others' plunder,
  And content for other slain.

TITLE Additional Poems, III

RHYME a b a b

When Adam walked in Eden young,
  Happy, 'tis writ, was he,
While high the fruit of knowledge hung
  Unbitten on the tree.
 
RHYME a b a b

Happy was he the livelong day;
  I doubt 'tis written wrong:
The heart of man, for all they say,
  Was never happy long.
 
RHYME a b a b

And now my feet are tired of rest,
  And here they will not stay,
And the soul fevers in my breast
  And aches to be away.

TITLE Additional Poems, IV

RHYME a b a b

It is no gift I tender,
  A loan is all I can;
But do not scorn the lender;
  Man gets no more from man.
 
RHYME a b a b

Oh, mortal man may borrow
  What mortal man can lend;
And 'twill not end to-morrow,
  Though sure enough 'twill end.
 
RHYME a b a b

If death and time are stronger,
  A love may yet be strong;
The world will last for longer,
  But this will last for long.

Here are the skies, the planets seven,
And all the starry train:
Content you with the mimic heaven,

RHYME a a b a

Ask me no more, for fear I should reply;
  Others have held their tongues, and so can I;
Hundreds have died, and told no tale before:
  Ask me no more, for fear I should reply --

RHYME a b a b

How one was true and one was clean of stain
  And one was braver than the heavens are high,
And one was fond of me: and all are slain.
  Ask me no more, for fear I should reply.

TITLE Additional Poems, VII

RHYME a b a b

He would not stay for me, and who can wonder?
  He would not stay for me to stand and gaze.
I shook his hand, and tore my heart in sunder,
  And went with half my life about my ways.

Morning up the eastern stair
Marches, azuring the air,
And the foot of twilight still
Is stolen toward the western sill.
Blithe the maids go milking, blithe
Men in hayfields stone the scythe;
All the land's alive around
Except the churchyard's idle ground.
There's empty acres west and east,
But aye 'tis God's that bears the least:
This hopeless garden that they sow
With the seeds that never grow

TITLE Additional Poems, XIA

RHYME a a *

They shall have breath that never were,
But he that was shall have it ne'er;
The unconceived and unbegot
Shall look on heaven, but he shall not.
The heart with many wildfires lit,
Ice is not so cold as it.
The thirst that rivers could not lay
A little dust has quenched for aye;
And in a fathom's compass lie
Thoughts much wider than the sky.

TITLE Additional Poems, XII

RHYME a a *

Stay, if you list, O passer by the way;
Yet night approaches; better not to stay.
  I never sigh, nor flush, nor knit the brow,
  Nor grieve to think how ill God made me, now.
Here, with one balm for many fevers found,
Whole of an ancient evil, I sleep sound.

TITLE Additional Poems, XIII

RHYME a b a b b

Oh turn not in from marching
  To taverns on the way.
The drought and thirst and parching
  A little dust will lay,
  And take desire away.

RHYME a b a b b

Oh waste no words a-wooing
  The soft sleep to your bed;
She is not worth pursuing,
  You will so soon be dead;
  And death will serve instead.

  And whom will my country find
To shore up the sky from falling?'
  My business: never you mind.

`Oh is it the newsboys crying
  Lost battle, retreat, despair,
And honour and England dying?'
  Well, fighting-cock, what if it were?

RHYME a b a b

The devil this side of the darnels

And quarrelsome chaps in charnels
  Must bear it as best they can.

RHYME a a b b

'Tis five years since, `An end,' said I;
`I'll march no further, time to die.
All's lost; no worse has heaven to give.'
Worse has it given, and yet I live.
 
RHYME a a b b

I shall not die to-day, no fear:
I shall live yet for many a year,
And see worse ills and worse again,
And die of age and not of pain.
 
RHYME a a b b

When God would rear from earth aloof
The blue height of the hollow roof,
He sought him pillars sure and strong,
And ere he found them sought them long.
 
RHYME a a b b

The stark steel splintered from the thrust,
The basalt mountain sprang to dust,
The blazing pier of diamond flawed
In shards of rainbow all abroad.
 
RHYME a a b b

What found he, that the heavens stand fast?
What pillar proven firm at last
Bears up so light that world-seen span?
The heart of man, the heart of man.

RHYME a a b b

Some can gaze and not be sick,
But I could never learn the trick.
There's this to say for blood and breath,
They give a man a taste for death.

TITLE Additional Poems, XVII

RHYME a a b b

The stars have not dealt me the worst they could do:
My pleasures are plenty, my troubles are two.
But oh, my two troubles they reave me of rest,
The brains in my head and the heart in my breast.
 
RHYME a a b b

Oh grant me the ease that is granted so free,
The birthright of multitudes, give it to me,
That relish their victuals and rest on their bed
With flint in the bosom and guts in the head.

TITLE Additional Poems, XVIII

RHYME a a b b

Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?
And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?
And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air?
Oh they're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.
 
RHYME a a b b

'Tis a shame to human nature, such a head of hair as his;
In the good old time 'twas hanging for the colour that it is;
Though hanging isn't bad enough and flaying would be fair
For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair.
 
RHYME a a b b

Oh a deal of pains he's taken and a pretty price he's paid
To hide his poll or dye it of a mentionable shade;
But they've pulled the beggar's hat off for the world to see and stare,
And they're haling him to justice for the colour of his hair.
 
RHYME a a b b

Now 'tis oakum for his fingers and the treadmill for his feet
And the quarry-gang on Portland in the cold and in the heat,
And between his spells of labour in the time he has to spare
He can curse the God that made him for the colour of his hair.

RHYME a a b b

In battles of no renown
My fellows and I fell down,
And over the dead men roar
The battles they lost before.

RHYME a a b b

The thunderstruck flagstaffs fall,
The earthquake breaches the wall,
The far-felled steeples resound,
And we lie under the ground.

RHYME a a b b

Oh, soldiers, saluted afar
By them that had seen your star,
In conquest and freedom and pride
Remember your friends that died.

RHYME a a b b

Amid rejoicing and song
Remember, my lads, how long,
How deep the innocent trod
The grapes of the anger of God.

TITLE Additional Poems, XX

RHYME a b a b b a b a

I shall not die for you,
  Another fellow may;
Good lads are left and true
  Though one departs away.
  But he departs to-day
And leaves his work to do,
  For I was luckless aye,
And shall not die for you.

The end of the year fell chilly
  Between a moon and a moon;
Through the twilight shrilly
  The bells rang, ringing no tune.

RHYME a b a b

The windows stained with story,
  The walls with miracle scored,
Were hidden for gloom and glory
  Filling the house of the Lord.

RHYME a b a b

Arch and aisle and rafter
  And roof-tree dizzily high
Were full of weeping and laughter
  And song and saying good-bye.

RHYME a b a b

There stood in the holy places
  A multitude none could name,
Ranks of dreadful faces
  Flaming, transfigured in flame.

RHYME a b a b

Thy Title, Epigrams, and nam'd of me,

Wormwood, and sulphur, sharp, and tooth'd withall,
Become a petulant Thing, hurl Ink, and Wit
As Mad-men Stones: not caring whom they hit.
Deceive their Malice, who could wish it so.
And by thy wiser Temper, let Men know
Thou art not Covetous of least Self-Fame,
Made from the hazard of another's Shame.
Much less, with leud, prophane, and beastly Phrase,
To catch the Worlds loose Laughter, or vain Gaze.
He that departs with his own Honesty
For vulgar Praise, doth it too dearly buy.

To lye upon thy Stall, till it be sought;
Not offer'd, as it made Suit to be bought;
Nor have my Title-leaf on Posts, or Walls,
Or in Cleft-sticks, advanced to make Calls
For Termers, or some Clerk-like Serving-man,
Who scarce can spell th' hard Names: whose Knight less can.

Send it to Bucklers-bury, there 'twill well.

Thou wert, as chief of them are said t'have been:
And such a Prince thou art we daily see,

Of Kings for Grace; of Poets for my Test?

Calls for his Stool, adorns the Stage: God pays.
To every Cause he meets, this Voice he brayes:
His only answer is to all, God pays.

Blaspheme God, greatly. Or some poor Hind beat,

Is it the Pain affrights? that's soon forgot.
Or you Complexions loss? you have a Pot,

To make amends yo'are thought a wholesome Creature.

I meant to make her Fair, and Free, and Wise,
Of greatest Blood, and yet more good than Great,

Nor lend like Influence from his lucent Seat.
I meant she should be Courteous, Facile, Sweet,
Hating that solemn Vice of Greatness, Pride;
I meant each softest Vertue, there should meet,
Fit in that softer Bosom to reside.
Only a Learned, and a Manly Soul
I purpos'd her; that should, with even powers,

Unto the Crys of London I'll add one;
Ripe Statesmen, ripe: They grow in every Street;
At six and twenty, ripe. You shall 'em meet,
And have 'em yield no favour, but of State.
Ripe are their Ruffs, their Cuffs, their Beards, their Gate,
And Grave as ripe, like mellow as their Faces.
They know the States of Christendom, not the Places:
Yet have they seen the Maps, and bought 'em too,
And understand 'em, as most Chapmen do.
The Counsels, Projects, Practices they know,
And what each Prince doth for Intelligence owe,
And unto whom: They are the Almanacks
For Twelve Years yet to come, what each State lacks.
They carry in their Pockets Tacitus,
And the Gazetti, or Gallo-Belgicus:
And talk reserv'd, lock'd up, and full of fear,
Nay, ask you, how the Day goes in your Ear:
Keep a Star-Chamber Sentence close, Twelve Days:
And whisper what a Proclamation says.
They meet in Sixes, and at every Mart,
Are sure to con' the Catalogue by heart;
Or, every Day, some one at Rimee's looks,
Or Bills, and there he buys the Names of Books.
They all get Porta, for the sundry ways
To write in Cypher, and the several Keys,
To ope' the Character. They've found the slight
With Juice of Limons, Onions, Piss, to write;
To break up Seals, and close 'em. And they know,
If the States make Peace, how it will go
With England. All forbidden Books they get.
And of the Powder-Plot, they will talk yet.
At naming the French King, their Heads they shake,
And at the Pope, and Spain slight Faces make.
Or 'gainst the Bishops, for the Brethren, rail,
Much like those Brethren; thinking to prevail
With ignorance on us, as they have done
On them: And therefore do not only shun
Others more modest, but contemn us too,
That know not so much State, wrong, as they do.

No more than Salust in the Roman State!

With those that come; whose Grace may make that seem
Something, which, else, could hope for no esteem.
It is the fair Acceptance, Sir, creates
The Entertainment perfect: not the Cates.
Yet shall you have, to rectifie your Palate,
An Olive, Capers, or some better Sallad
Ush'ring the Mutton; with a short-leg'd Hen,
If we can get her, full of Eggs, and then,
Limons, and Wine for Sauce: to these, a Coney

And, though Fowl, now, be scarce, yet there are Clarks,
The Sky not falling, think we may have Larks.
I'll tell you of more, and lye, so you will come:
Of Partridg, Pheasant, Wood-cock, of which some
May yet be there; and Godwit if we can:
Knat, Rail, and Ruff too. How so ere, my Man
Shall read a Piece of Virgil, Tacitus,

Of which we'll speak our Minds, amidst our Meat;
And I'll profess no Verses to repeat:

That will the Pastry, not my Paper, show of.
Digestive Cheese, and Fruit there sure will be;
But that, which most doth take my Muse, and me,

Which is the Mermaids, now, but shall be mine:
Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted,
Their Lives, as do their Lines, till now had lasted.
Tabacco, Nectar, or the Thespian Spring,

Of this we will sup free, but moderately,
And we will have no Pooly', or Parrot by;
Nor shall our Cups make any guilty Men:
But, at our parting, we will be, as when
We innocently met. No simple Word,

But in the view, doth interrupt their Sin;

The Common-wealth still safe, must study thee.

And noted for what Flesh such Souls were fram'd,
Know you to be a Sydney, though unnam'd?
And being nam'd, how little doth that Name
Need any Muses Praise to give it Fame?
Which is, it self, the Imprese of the great,
And glory of them all, but to repeat!
Forgive me then, if mine but say you are
A Sydney: but in that extend as far
As lowdest Praisers, who perhaps would find
For every part a Character assign'd.

Even in the dew of Grace, what you would be?
Or did our Times require it, to behold
A new Susanna, equal to that old?
Or, because some scarce think that Story true,
To make those Faithful, did the Fates send you?
And to your Scene lent no less dignity
Of Birth, of Match, of Form, of Chastity?
Or, more than born for the Comparison
Of former Age, or Glory of our own,
Were you advanced, past those Times to be
The light, and mark unto Posterity?

Who could not but create them all, from you?
He, that but saw you wear the vvheaten Hat,
Would call you more than Ceres, if not that:
And, drest in Shepherds tyre, who would not say:

And, armed to the Chase, so bare her bow
Diana'alone, so hit, and hunted so.

Being no vitious Person, but the Vice
About the Town; and known too, at that price.
A subtle Thing, that doth Affections win
By speaking well o'th' Company it's in.
Talks loud, and bawdy, has a gather'd deal
Of News, and Noise, to sow out a long Meal.
Can come from Tripoly, leap Stools, and Wink,
Do all, that 'longs to the Anarchy of Drink,
Except the Duel. Can sing Songs, and Catches;
Give every one his Dose of Mirth: and watches
Whose Name's unwelcome to the present ear,
And him it lays on; if he be not there.
Tells of him, all the Tales, it self then makes;
But, if it shall be question'd, undertakes,
It will deny all; and forswear it too:
Not that it fears, but will have to do
With such a one. And therein keeps it's Word.

From friendship, is its own Fames architect.

But still their Valor, and their Virtue fenc't 'em,
And, on they went, like Castor brave, and Pollux:
Plowing the Main. When, see (the worst of all Lucks)
They met the second Prodigy, would fear a
Man, that had never heard of a ChimNfra.
One said, It was bold Briareus, or the Beadle,
(Who hath the hundred Hands when he doth meddle)
The other thought it Hydra, or the Rock
Made of the Trull, that cut her Father's Lock:
But, coming near, they found it but a Liter,
So huge, it seem'd, they could by no means quit her.
Back, cry'd their Brace of Charons: they cry'd, No,
No going back; on still you Rogues, and row.
How hight the place? A Voice was heard, Cocytus.
Row close then Slaves. Alas, they will beshite us.
No matter, Stinkards, row. What croaking Sound
Is this we hear? Of Frogs? No, Guts Wind-bound,
Over your Heads: Well, row. At this a loud
Crack did report itself, as if a Cloud
Had burst with Storm, and down fell, ab Excelsis,
Poor Mercury, crying out on Paracelsus,
And all his Followers, that had so abus'd him:
And, in so shitten sort, so long had us'd him:
For (where he was the god of Eloquence,
And subtilty of Metals) they dispense
His Spirits, now, in Pills, and eke in Potions,
Suppositories, Cataplasms, and Lotions.
But many Moons there shall not wane (quoth he)
(In the mean time, let 'em imprison me)
But I will speak (and know I shall be heard)
Touching this Cause, where they will be affeard
To answer me. And sure, it was th' intent
Of the grave Fart, late let in Parliament,
Had it been seconded, and not in Fume
Vanish'd away: as you must all presume
Their Mercury did now. By this, the Steme
Of the Hulk touch'd, and, as by Polypheme
The sly Ulysses stole in a Sheep-skin,
The well-greas'd Wherry now had got between,
And bade her Farewell Sough, unto the Lurden:
Never did Bottom more betray her Burden;
The Meat-boat of Bears-Colledge, Paris-Garden,
Stunk not so ill; nor, when she kist, Kate Arden.
Yet, one day in the year, for sweet 'tis voyc't
And that is when it is the Lord Mayor's Foist.
By this time had they reach'd the Stygian Pool,
By which the Masters swear, when on the Stool
Of Worship, they their nodding Chins do hit
Against their Breasts. Here, sev'ral Ghosts did flit
About the shore, of Farts, but late departed,
White, Black, Blue, Green, and in more Forms out-started,
Than all those Atomi Ridiculous,
Whereof old Democrite, and Hill Nicholas,
One said, the other swore, the World consists.
These be the cause of those thick frequent Mists
Arising in that place, through which, who goes,
Must try th' unused Valor of a Nose:

RHYME a a *

And that ours did. For, yet, no Nare was tainted,
Nor Thumb, nor Finger to the Stop acquainted,
But open, and unarm'd, encounter'd all:
Whether it languishing stuck upon the Wall,
Or were precipitated down the Jakes,
And, after, swum abroad in ample Flakes,
Or, that it lay, heap'd like an Usurer's Mass,
All was to them the same, they were to pass,
And so they did, from Styx, to Acheron:
The ever-boiling Flood. Whose Banks upon
Your Fleet-Lane Furies; and hot Cooks do dwell,
That, with Still-scalding Steems, make the place Hell.
The Sinks ran Grease, and Hair of meazled Hogs,
The Heads, Houghs, Entrails, and the Hydes of Dogs:
For, to say truth, what Scullion is so nasty,
To put the Skins, and Offal in a Pasty?
Cats there lay divers had been flead and rosted,
And, after mouldy grown, again were tosted,
Then selling not, a Dish was ta'ne to mince 'em,
But still, it seem'd, the rankness did convince 'em.
For, here they were thrown in with th' melted Pewter,
Yet drown'd they not. They had five Lives in future.

RHYME a a *

But 'mongst these Tiberts, who do you think there was?
Old Banks the Jugler, our Pythagoras,
Grave Tutor to the learned Horse. Both which,
Being, beyond Sea, burned for one Witch:
Their Spirits transmigrated to a Cat:
And, now, above the Pool, a Face right fat
With great grey Eyes, are lifted up, and mew'd;
Thrice did it spit: thrice div'd. At last, it view'd
Our brave Heroes with a milder Glare,
And in a pitious Tune, began. How dare
Your dainty Nostrils (in so hot a Season,
When every Clerk eats Artichokes and Peason,
Laxative Lettuce, and such windy Meat)
Tempt such a passage? when each Privies Seat
Is fill'd with Buttock? And the Walls do sweat
Urine, and Plasters? When the Noise doth beat
Upon your Ears, of Discords so unsweet?
And Outcries of the damned in the Fleet?
Cannot the Plague-Bill keep you back? Nor Bells
Of loud Sepulchres with their hourly Knels,
But you will visit grisly Pluto's Hall?
Behold where Cerberus, rear'd on the Wall
Of Holborne (three Sergeants Heads) looks o're
And stays but till you come unto the Door!
Tempt not his Fury, Pluto is away:
And Madame CNfsar, great Proserpina,
Is now from home. You lose your Labours quite,
Were you Jove's Sons, or had Alcides Might.
They cry'd out Pusse. He told them he was Banks,
That had so often, shew'd 'em merry Pranks.
They laught, at his laugh-worthy Fate. And past
The Tripple-Head without a Sop. At last,
Calling for Radamanthus, that dwelt by,
A Sope-Boyler; and NFacus him nigh,
Who kept an Alehouse; with my little Minos,
An ancient pur-blind Fletcher, with a high Nose;
They took 'em all to witness of their Action:
And so went bravely back, without Protraction.

In memory of which most liquid Deed,
The City since hath rais'd a Pyramid.
And I could wish for their eterniz'd Sakes,
My Muse had plough'd with his, that sung A-jax.

SOme act of Love's bound to rehearse,
I thought to bind him, in my Verse:
Which when he felt, Away (quoth he)
Can Poets hope to fetter me?
It is enough, they once did get
Mars, and my Mother, in their Net:
I wear not these my Wings in vain,
With which he fled me: and again,
Into my Rhymes could ne're be got
By any art. Then wonder not,
That since, my Numbers are so cold,
When Love is fled, and I grow old.

THou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show,
Of touch, or marble; nor canst boast a row
Of polish'd Pillars, or a Roof of Gold:
Thou hast no lanthern, whereof Tales are told;
Or Stair, or Courts; but stand'st an ancient Pile,
And these grudg'd at, are reverenc'd the while.
Thou joy'st in better marks, of Soil, of Air,
Of Wood, of Water: therein thou art fair.
Thou hast thy Walks for health, as well as sport:
Thy Mount, to which the Dryads do resort,
Where Pan, and Bacchus their high Feasts have made,
Beneath the broad Beech, and the Chestnut shade;
That taller Tree, which of a Nut was set,
At his great Birth, where all the Muses met.
There, in the writhed Bark, are cut the Names
Of many a Sylvane, taken with his Flames,
And thence the ruddy Satyrs oft provoke
The lighter Fauns, to reach thy Lady's Oke.
Thy Copp's too, nam'd of Gamage, thou hast there,
That never fails to serve thee season'd Deer,
When thou would'st Feast, or exercise thy Friends.
The lower Land, that to the River bends,
Thy Sheep, thy Bullocks, Kine, and Calves do feed:
The middle Grounds thy Mares, and Horses breed.
Each Bank doth yield thee Conies; and the Topps
Fertile of Wood, Ashore, and Sydney's Copp's,
To crown thy open Table, doth provide
The purpled Pheasant, with the speckled side:
The painted Partridg lyes in every Field,
And, for thy Mess, is willing to be kill'd.
And if the high-swoln Medway fail thy Dish,
Thou hast thy Ponds, that pay thee tribute Fish,
Fat, aged Carps, that run into thy Net.
And Pikes, now weary their own Kind to eat,
As loth, the second Draught, or Cast to stay,
Officiously, at first, themselves betray.

RHYME a a *

Bright Eels, that emulate them, and leap on Land,
Before the Fisher, or into his Hand.
Then hath thy Orchard Fruit, thy Garden Flowers,
Fresh as the Air, and new as are the Hours.
The early Cherry, with the later Plum,
Fig, Grape, and Quince, each in his time doth come:
The blushing Apricot, and woolly Peach
Hang on thy Walls, that every Child may reach.
And though thy Walls be of the Country Stone,
They're rear'd with no Man's ruin, no Man's grone;
There's none, that dwell about them, wish them down;
But all come in, the Farmer and the Clown:
And no one empty-handed, to salute
Thy Lord, and Lady, though they have no Sute.
Some bring a Capon, some a rural Cake,
Some Nuts, some Apples; some that think they make
The better Cheeses, bring 'em; or else send
By their ripe Daughters, whom they would commend
This way to Husbands; and whose Baskets bear
An Emblem of themselves, in Plum, or Pear.
But what can this (more than express their love)
Add to thy free Provisions, far above
The need of such? whose liberal Board doth flow,
With all, that Hospitality doth know!
Where comes no Guest, but is allow'd to eat,
Without his fear, and of thy Lord's own Meat:
Where the same Bear, and Bread, and self-same Wine,
That is his Lordship's, shall be also mine.
And I not fain to sit (as some, this day,
At great Mens Tables) and yet dine away.
Here no Man tells my Cups; nor, standing by,
A Waiter, doth my Gluttony envy:
But gives me what I call for, and lets me eat,
He knows, below, he shall find plenty of Meat;
Thy Tables hoard not up for the next day,
Nor, when I take my Lodging, need I pray
For Fire, or Lights, or Livory: all is there;
As if thou, then, wert mine, or I raign'd here:
There's nothing I can wish, for which I stay.
That found King James, when hunting late, this way,
With his brave Son, the Prince, they saw thy Fires
Shine bright on every Hearth as the desires
Of thy Penates had been set on Flame,
To entertain them; or the Country came,
With all their zeal, to warm their welcom here.
What (great, I will not say, but) sudden chear
Didst thou, then, make 'em! and what praise was heap'd
On thy good Lady, then! who therein, reap'd
The just Reward of her high Huswifery;
To have her Linnen, Plate, and all Things nigh,
When she was far: and not a Room, but drest,
As if it had expected such a Guest!
These, Penshurst, are thy praise, and yet not all.
Thy Lady's noble, fruitful, chast withall.
His Children thy great Lord may call his own:
A Fortune, in this Age, but rarely known.

They are, and have been taught Religion: Thence
Their gentler Spirits have suck'd Innocence.
Each morn, and even, they are taught to pray,
With the whole Houshold, and may, every day,
Read, in their virtuous Parents noble Parts,
The mysteries of Manners, Arms, and Arts.
Now, Penshurst, they that will proportion thee
With other Edifices, when they see
Those proud ambitious Heaps, and nothing else,
May say, their Lords have built, but thy Lord dwells.

HOw blest art thou, canst love the Country, Wroth,
Whether by Choice, or Fate, or both!
And, though so near the City, and the Court,
Art tane with neithers Vice, nor Sport:
That at great Times, art no ambitious Guest,
Of Sheriffs Dinner, or Mayor's Feast.
Nor com'st to view the better Cloth of State;
The richer Hangings, or Crown-plate;
Nor throng'st (when Masquing is) to have a sight
Of the short Bravery of the Night;
To view the Jewels, Stuffs, the Pains, the Wit
There wasted, some not paid for yet!
But canst, at home, in thy securer rest,
Live, with unbought Provision blest;
Free from proud Porches, or their gilded Roofs,
'Mongst loughing Heards, and solid Hoofs:
Along'st the curled Woods, and painted Meads,
Through which a Serpent River leads
To some cool, courteous Shade, which he calls his,
And makes Sleep softer than it is!
Or, if thou list the Night in watch to break,
A-bed canst hear the loud Stag speak,
In spring, oft roused for their Master's Sport,
Who, for it, makes thy House his Court;
Or with thy Friends; the heart of all the Year,
Divid'st, upon the lesser Deer;
In Autumn, at the Partridg mak'st a Flight,
And giv'st thy gladder Guests the Sight;
And, in the Winter, hunt'st the flying Hare,
More for thy Exercise, than Fare;
While all, that follow, their glad Ears apply
To the full greatness of the Cry:
Or hauking at the River, or the Bush,
OtOr shooting at the greedy Thrush,
Thou dost with some Delight the Day out-wear,
Although the coldest of the Year!
The whil'st the several Seasons thou hast seen
Of Flowry Fields, of cop'ces Green,
The mowed Meadows, with the fleeced Sheep,
And Feasts, that either Shearers keep;
The ripened Ears, yet humble in their height,
And Furrows laden with their weight;
The Apple-harvest, that doth longer last;
The Hogs return'd home fat from mast;
The Trees cut out in log; and those Boughs made
A Fire now, that lend a Shade!
Thus Pan, and Sylvane, having had their Rites,
Comus, puts in, for new Delights;
And fills thy open Hall with mirth, and cheer
As if in Saturns Reign it were;
Apollo's Harp, and Hermes Lyre resound,
Nor are the Muses Strangers found:
The rout of rural Folk come thronging in,
(Their rudeness then is thought no Sin)
Thy noblest Spouse affords them welcome Grace;
And the great Heroes, of her Race,
Sit mixt with loss of State, or Reverence.
Freedom doth with Degree dispense.
The jolly Wassal walks the often round,
And in their Cups, their Cares are drown'd:

RHYME a a *

They think not, then, which side the Cause shall leese,
Nor how to get the Lawyer Fees.
Such, and no other was that Age, of old,
Which boasts t'have had the Head of Gold.
And such since thou canst make thine own content,
Strive, Wroth, to live long innocent.
Let others watch in guilty Arms, and stand
The fury of a rash command,
Go enter Breaches, meet the Cannons rage,
That they may Sleep with Scars in Age.
And shew their Feathers shot, and Colours torn,
And brag that they were therefore born.
Let this Man sweat, and wrangle at the Bar,
For every price in every Jar,
And change Possessions, oftner with his Breath,
Than either Money, War, or Death:
Let him, than hardest Sires, more disinherit,
And each where boast it as his Merit,
To blow up Orphans, Widows, and their States;
And think his Power doth equal Fates.
Let that go heap a Mass of wretched Wealth,
Purchas'd by Rapine, worse than Stealth,
And brooding o're it sit, with broadest Eyes,
Not doing good, scarce when he dyes.
Let thousands more go flatter Vice, and win,
By being Organs to great Sin,
Get Place and Honor, and be glad to keep
The Secrets, that shall break their Sleep:
And so they ride in Purple, eat in Plate,
Though Poyson, think it a great Fate.
But thou, my Wroth, if I can truth apply,
Shalt neither that, nor this envy:
Thy Peace is made; and, when Man's state is well,
'Tis better, if he there can dwell.
God wisheth, none should wrack on a strange Shelf:
To him Man's dearer, than t'himself.
And, howsoever we may think Things sweet,
He always gives what he knows meet;
Which who can use is happy: Such be thou.
Thy Mornings and thy Evenings Vow
Be Thanks to him, and earnest Prayer, to find
A body Sound, with sounder Mind;
To do thy Country service, thy self right;
That neither Want do thee affright,
Nor Death; but when thy latest Sand is spent,
Thou may'st think Life, a Thing but lent.

That Hour upon my Morn of Age,
Hence-forth I quit thee from my Thought,
My part is ended on thy Stage.
Do not once hope, that thou canst tempt
A Spirit so resolv'd to tread
Upon thy Throat, and live exempt
From all the Nets that thou canst spread.
I know thy Forms are studied Arts,
Thy subtil Ways, be narrow Straits;
Thy curtesy but sudden Starts,
And what thou call'st thy Gifts are Baits.
I know too, though thou Strut, and Paint,
Yet art thou both shrunk up, and old;
That only Fools make thee a Saint,
And all thy Good is to be sold.
I know thou whole art but a Shop
Of Toys, and Trifles, Traps, and Snares,
To take the weak, or make them stop:
Yet art thou falser than thy Wares.
And, knowing this should I yet stay,
Like such as blow away their Lives,
And never will redeem a Day,
Enamor'd of their golden Gyves?

Or having 'scap'd shall I return,
And thrust my Neck into the Noose,
From whence so lately, I did burn,
With all my Powers, my self to loose?

That fled his Cage, or broke his Chain,
And tasting Air, and Freedom 'twull
Render his Head in theirthere again?
If these, who have but Sense, can shun
The Engins, that have them annoy'd;
Little, for me, had Reason done,
If I could not thy Ginns avoid.
Yes, threaten, do. Alas I fear
As little, as I hope from thee:
I know thou canst nor shew, nor bear
More hatred, than thou hast to me.
My tender, first, and simple Years
Thou did'st abuse, and then betray;
Since stird'st up Jealousies and Fears,
When all the Causes were away.
Then, in a Soil hast planted me,
Where breathe the basest of thy Fools;
Where envious Arts professed be,
And Pride, and Ignorance the Schools,
Where nothing is examin'd, weigh'd,
But, as 'tis rumor'd, so believ'd:
Where every Freedom is betray'd,
And every Goodness tax'd, or griev'd.
But, what we're born for, we must bear:
Our frail Condition it is such,
That, what to all may happen here,
If't chance to me, I must not grutch.
Else, I my state should much mistake,
To harbour a divided Thought
From all my Kind: that, for my sake,
There should a Miracle be wrought.
No, I do know, that I was born
To Age, Misfortune, Sickness, Grief:
But I will bear these, with that scorn,
As shall not need thy false Relief.
Nor for my Peace will I go far,
As Wand'rers do, that still do rome;
But make my Strengths, such as they are,
Here in my Bosom, and at home.

Or else the Sentinel
(That should ring Larum to the Heart) doth sleep,
Or some great Thought doth keep
Back the Intelligence, and falsly Swears,
Th'are base, and idle Fears
Whereof the loyal Conscience so complains.
Thus by these subtile Trains,
Do several Passions invade the Mind,
And strike our Reason blind.
Of which usurping Rank, some have thought Love
The first; as prone to move
Most frequent Tumults, Horrors, and Unrests,
In our enflamed Breasts:
But this doth from the Cloud of Error grow,
Which thus we over-blow.
The Thing, they here call Love, is blind Desire,
Arm'd with Bow, Shafts, and Fire;
Inconstant, like the Sea, of whence 'tis born,
Rough, swelling, like a Storm:
With whom who Sails, rides on the surge of Fear,
And Boils, as if he were
In a continual Tempest. Now, true Love
No such Effects doth prove;
That is an Essence far more gentle, fine,
Pure, perfect, nay divine;
It is a golden Chain let down from Heaven,
Whose Links are bright, and even.
That falls like Sleep on Lovers, and combines
The soft, and sweetest Minds
In equal Knots: This bears no Brands, nor Darts,
To murther different Hearts,
But, in a calm, and god-like Unity,
Preserves Community.

O, who is he, that (in this peace) enjoys
Th' Elixir of all Joys?
A Form more fresh, than are the Eden Bowers,
And lasting, as her Flowers:
Richer than Time, and as Time's Virtue, rare:
Sober, as saddest Care:
A fixed Thought, an Eye untaught to glance;
Who (blest with such high Chance)
Would, at suggestion of a steep desire,
Cast himself from the Spire
Of all his Happiness? But soft: I hear
Some vicious Fool draw near,
That cries, we Dream, and swears there's no such thing,
As this chaste Love we sing.
Peace Luxury, thou art like one of those
Who, being at Sea, suppose,
Because they move, the Continent doth so.
No, Vice, we let thee know,
Tho' thy wild thoughts with Sparrows Wings do flie,
Turtles can chastly die;
And yet (in this t'express our selves more clear)
We do not number here,
Such Spirits as are only Continent,
Because Lust's means are spent:
Or those, who doubt the Common Mouth of Fame,
And for their Place and Name,
Cannot so safely sin. Their Chastity
Is meer Necessity.
Nor mean we those, whom Vows and Conscience
Have fill'd with Abstinence:
Tho' we acknowledg, who can so abstain,
Makes a most blessed Gain.
He that for love of Goodness hateth Ill,
Is more Crown-worthy still,
Than he, which for Sin's Penalty forbears;
His Heart sins, tho' he fears.
But we propose a Person like our Dove,
Grac'd with a Ph���nix love;
A Beauty of that clear, and sparkling light,
Would make a Day of Night,
And turn the blackest Sorrows to bright Joys:
Whose od'rous Breath destroys
All taste of bitterness, and makes the Air
As sweet as she is fair.
A Body so harmoniously compos'd,
As if Nature disclos'd
All her best Symmetry in that one Feature!
O, so Divine a Creature,
Who could be false to? chiefly when he knows
How only she bestows
The wealthy treasure of her love on him;
Making his Fortunes swim
In the full flood of her admir'd perfection?
What savage, brute affection,
Would not be fearful to offend a Dame
Of this excelling Frame?
Much more a noble, and right generous mind
(To vertuous moods inclin'd)
That knows the weight of guilt: He will refrain
From thoughts of such a strain.
And to his Sense object this Sentence ever,
Man may securely sin, but safely never.

WHil'st that, for which all Vertue now is sold,
And almost every Vice, almighty Gold,
That which, to boot with Hell, is thought worth Heaven,
And for it, Life, Conscience, yea Souls are given,
Toyles, by grave custom, up and down the Court,
To every Squire, or Groom, that will report
Well, or ill, only all the following Year,
Just to the weight their this days Presents bear;
While it makes Huishers serviceable Men,
And some one apteth to be trusted then,
Though never after; whiles it gains the Voice
Of some grand Peer, whose Air doth make rejoice
The Fool that gave it; who will want, and weep,
When his proud Patron's Favours are asleep;
While thus it buys great Graee,Grace and hunts poor Fame;
Runs between Man, and Man; 'tween Dame, and Dame;
Solders crackt Friendship; makes Love last a day;
Or perhaps less: whil'st Gold bears all this sway,
I, that have none (to send you) send you Verse.
A Present which (if elder Writs reherse
The truth of Times) was once of more esteem,
Than this, our Guilt, nor golden Age can deem,
When Gold was made no Weapon to cut Throats,
Or put to flight Astrea, when her Ingots
Were yet unfound, and better plac'd in earth,
Than, here, to give Pride fame, and Peasants birth.
But let this Dross carry what price it will
With noble Ignorants, and let them still,
Turn, upon scorned Verse, their Quarter-face:
With you, I know, my off'ring will find grace.
For what a Sin 'gainst your great Father's Spirit,
Were it to think, that you should not inherit
His love unto the Muses, when his skill
Almost you have, or may have, when you will?
Wherein wise Nature you a Dowry gave,
Worth an Estate, treble to that you have.
Beauty, I know, is good, and Blood is more;
Riches thought most: But, Madam, think what store
The World hath seen, which all these had in trust,
And now lie lost in their forgotten Dust.
It is the Muse alone, can raise to Heaven,
And, at her strong Arms end, hold up, and even,
The Souls, she loves. Those other glorious Notes,
Inscrib'd in touch or marble, or the Cotes
Painted, or carv'd upon our great Mens Tombs,
Or in their Windows; do but prove the Wombs,
That bred them, Graves: when they were born, they dy'd,
That had no Muse to make their Fame abide.
How many equal with the Argive Queen,
Have Beauty known, yet none so famous seen?
Achilles was not first, that valiant was,
Or, in an Army's head, that lockt in brass,
Gave killing strokes. There were brave Men, before
Ajax, or Idomen, or all the store,
That Homer brought to Troy; yet none so live:
Because they lack'd the sacred Pen, could give
Like life unto 'em. Who heav'd Hercules
Unto the Stars? or the Tyndarides?
Who placed Jasons Argo in the Sky?
Or set bright Ariadnes Crown so high?
Who made a Lamp of Berenices Hair?
Or lifted Cassiopea in her Chair?
But only Poets, rapt with Rage divine?
And such, or my hopes fail, shall make you shine.
You, and that other Star, that purest light,
Of all Lucina's Train; Lucy the bright.
Than which, a nobler Heaven itself knows not.
Who, though she have a better Verser got,
(Or Poet, in the Court account) than I,
And, who doth me (though I not him) envy,
Yet, for the timely Favours she hath done,
To my less sanguine Muse, wherein she hath won
My grateful Soul, the subject of her powers,
I have already us'd some happy hours,
To her remembrance; which when time shall bring
To curious light, to Notes, I then shall sing,
Will prove old Orpheus Act no Tale to be:
For I shall move Stocks, Stones, no less than he.
Then all, that have but done my Muse least grace,
Shall thronging come, and boast the happy place
They hold in my strange Poems, which, as yet,
Had not their Form touch'd by an English Wit.
There like a rich, and golden Pyramid,
Born up by Statues, shall I rear your Head,
Above your under-carved Ornaments,
And shew, how, to the Life, my Soul presents
Your Form imprest there: not with tickling Rhymes,
Or Common-places, filch'd, that take these Times,
But high, and noble matter, such as flies
From Brains entranc'd, and fill'd with Extasies;
Moods, which the god-like Sydney oft did prove,
And your brave Friend, and mine so well did love.

TI S grown almost a danger to speak true
Of any good Mind, now: There are so few.
The bad, by number, are so fortify'd,
As what they've lost t'expect, they dare deride.
So both the Prais'd, and Praisers suffer: Yet,
For others ill, ought none their good forget.
I, therefore, who profess my self in Love,
With every Virtue, whereso're it move,
And howsoever; as I am at Feud
With Sin and Vice, though with a Throne endu'd;
And, in this Name, am given out dangerous
By Arts, and Practice of the Vicious,
Such as suspect themselves, and think it fit
For their own cap'tal Crimes, t'indite my Wit;
I, that have suffer'd this; and, though forsook
Of Fortune, have not alter'd yet my look,
Or so my self abandon'd, as because
Men are not just, or keep no holy Laws
Of Nature, and Society, I should faint;
Or fear to draw true Lines, 'cause others Paint:
I, Madam, am become your Praiser. Where,
If it may stand with your soft Blush to hear,
Your Self but told unto Your Self, and see
In my Character, what your Features be,
You will not from the Paper slightly pass:
No Lady, but at sometime loves her Glass.
And this shall be no false one, but as much
Remov'd, as you from Need to have it such.
Look then, and see your Self. I will not say
Your Beauty; for you see that every day:
And so do many more. All which can call
It perfect, proper, pure, and natural,
Not taken up o'th'Doctors, but as well
As I, can say, and see it doth excel.
That asks but to be censur'd by the Eyes:
And, in those outward Forms, all Fools are wise.
Nor that your Beauty wanted not a Dower,
Do I reflect. Some Alderman has power,
Or cos'ning Farmer of the Customs so,
T'advance his doubtful Issue, and o'reflow
A Princes Fortune: These are gifts of Chance,
And raise not Virtue; they may Vice enhance.
My Mirror is more subtil, clear, refin'd,
And takes, and gives the Beauties of the mind.
Though it reject not those of Fortune: such
As Blood, and Match. Wherein, how more than much
Are you engaged to your happy Fate,
For such a Lot! that mixt you with a State
Of so great Title, Birth, but Virtue most,
Without which, all the rest were sounds, or lost.
'Tis only that can Time, and Chance defeat:
For he, that once is good, is ever great.
Wherewith, then Madam, can you better pay
This blessing of your Stars, than by that way
Of Virtue, which you tread? What if alone?
Without Companions? 'Tis safe to have none.
In single paths, Dangers with ease are watch'd:
Contagion in the Preasealternate spelling of 'Press' is soonest catch'd.
This makes, that wisely you decline your Life,
Far from the maze of Custom, Error, Strife,
And keep an even, and unhalter'd Gait;
Not looking by, or back, (like those, that wait
Times, and Occasions, to start forth, and seem)
Which though the turning World may disesteem,
Because that Studies Spectacles, and Shows,
And after varied, as fresh Objects goes,
Giddy with Change, and therefore cannot see
Right, the right way: yet must your comfort be
Your Conscience, and not Wonder, if none asks
For Truth's Complexion, where they all wear Masks.
Let who will follow Fashions, and Attires,
Maintain their Liedgers forth, for Foreign Wyres,
Melt down their Husbands Land, to pour away
On the close Groom, and Page, on New-years Day,
And almost, all Days after, while they live;
(They find it both so witty, and safe to give)
Let'em on Poulders, Oyls, and Paintings, spend,
Till that no Usurer, nor his Bawds dare lend
Them, or their Officers: and no Man know,
Whether it be a Face they wear, or no.
Let 'em waste Body, and 'State; and after all,
When their own Parasites laugh at their Fall,
May they have nothing left, whereof they can
Boast, but how oft they have gone wrong to Man:
And call it their brave Sin. For such there be
That do sin only for the Infamy:
And never think, how Vice doth every hour,
Eat on her Clients, and some one devour.
You, Madam, young have learn'd to shun these Shelves,
Whereon the most of Mankind wreck themselves,
And, keeping a just Course, have early put
Into your Harbour, and all passage shut
'Gainst Storms, or Pirats, that might charge your Peace;
For which you worthy are the glad Increase
Of your blest Womb, made fruitful from above
To pay your Lord the pledges of chaste Love:
And raise a noble Stem, to give the Fame,
To Clifton's Blood, that is deny'd their Name.
Grow, grow, fair Tree, and as thy Branches shoot,
Hear, what the Muses sing above thy Root,
By me, their Priest (if they can ought Divine)
Before the Moons have fill'd their triple Trine,
To crown the Burden which you go withall,
It shall a ripe and timely Issue fall,
T'expect the Honours of great Aubigny:
And greater Rites, yet writ in Mystery,
But which the Fates forbid me to reveal.
Only, thus much, out of a ravish'd Zeal,
Unto your Name, and goodness of your Life,
They speak; since you are truly that rare Wife,
Other great Wives may blush at: when they see
What your try'd manners are, what theirs should be.
How you love one, and him you should; how still
You are depending on his Word, and Will;
Not fashion'd for the Court, or Stranger's Eyes;
But to preaseplease him, who is the dearer Prize
Unto himself, by being so dear to you.
This makes, that your Affections still be new,
And that your Souls conspire, as they were gone
Each into other, and had now made one.
Live that one, still; and as long years do pass,
Madam, be bold to use this truest Glass:
Wherein, your Form, you still the same shall find;
Because nor it can change, nor such a Mind.

This here sung, can be no other,

So hath Homer prais'd her Hair;
So Anacreon drawn the Air

Just about her sparkling Eyes,
Both her Brows bent like my Bow.

Which you call my Shafts. And see!
Such my Mothers Blushes be,
As the Bath your Verse discloses
In her Cheeks of Milk and Roses;
Such as oft I wanton in?
And, above her even Chin,
Have you plac'd the Bank of Kisses,
Where you say, Men gather Blisses,
Rip'ned with a breath more sweet,
Than when Flowers, and West-winds meet.
Nay, her white and polish'd Neck,
With the Lace that doth it deck,
Is my Mothers! Hearts of slain
Lovers, made into a Chain!
And between each rising Breast,
Lies the Valley, call'd my Nest,
Where I sit and preen my Wings
After flight; and put new stings
To my Shafts! Her very Name,
With my Mothers, is the same.
I confess all, I reply'd,
And the Glass hangs by her side,
And the Girdle 'bout her waste,
All is Venus, save unchaste.
But alas, thou seest the least
Of her good, who is the best
Of her Sex: But could'st thou, Love,
Call to mind the Forms that strove
For the Apple, and those three
Make in one, the same were she.
For this Beauty yet doth hide,
Something more than thou hast spi'd.
Outward Grace weak Love beguiles:
She is Venus, when she smiles;
But she's Juno, when she walks,

CHaris, guess, and do not miss,
Since I drew a Morning Kiss
From your Lips, and suck'd an air
Thence, as sweet, as you are fair.
What my Muse and I have done:
Whether we have lost, or won,
If by us, the odds were laid,
That the Bride (allow'd a Maid)
Look'd not half so fresh and fair,
With th' advantage of her Hair,
And her Jewels, to the view
Of th' Assembly, as did you!
Or, that did you sit, or walk,
You were more the Eye, and talk
Of the Court, to day, than all
Else that glister'd in White-hall;
So, as those that had your sight,
Wisht the Bride were chang'd to Night.
And did think such Rites were due
To no other Grace but you!
Or, if you did move to Night
In the Dances, with what spight
Of your Peers, you were beheld,
That at every Motion swell'd
So to see a Lady tread,
As might all the Graces lead,
And was worthy (being so seen)
To be envi'd of the Queen.
Or if you would yet have stay'd,
Whether any would up-braid
To himself his loss of Time;
Or have charg'd his sight of Crime,
To have left all sight for you.
Guess of these, which is the true;
And, if such a Verse as this,
May not claim another Kiss.

RHYME a a b c b c

FOr Loves-sake, kiss me once again,
I long, and should not beg in vain,
Here's none to spy, or see;
Why do you doubt, or stay?
I'll taste as lightly as the Bee,
That doth but touch his Flower, and flies away.

RHYME a a b c b c

Once more, and (faith) I will be gone,
Can he that loves, ask less than one?
Nay, you may err in this,
and all your Bounty wrong:
This could be call'd but half a Kiss.
What we 're but once to do, we should do long,

RHYME a a b c b c

I will but mend the last and tell
Where, how it would have relish'd well;
Joyn Lip to Lip, and try:
Each suck others breath,
And whilst our Tongues perplexed lie,
Let who will think us dead, or wish our death.

RHYME a a *

CHaris one day in discourse
Had of Love, and of his force,
Lightly promis'd, she would tell
What a Man she could love well:
And that promise set on fire
All that heard her, with desire.
With the rest, I long expected,
When the work would be effected:
But we find that cold delay,
And Excuse spun every day,
As, until she tell her one,
We all fear, she loveth none.
Therefore, Charis, you must do't,
For I will so urge you to't,
You shall neither eat, nor sleep,
No, nor forth your Window peep,
With your Emissary Eye,
To fetch in the Forms go by:
And pronounce, which Band or Lace,
Better fits him than his Face;
Nay, I will not let you sit
'Fore your Idol Glass a whit,
To say over every purl
There; or to reform a curl;
Or with Secretary Sis
To consult, if Fucus this
Be as good, as was the last:
All your sweet of Life is past,
Make accompt, unless you can,
(And that quickly) speak your Man.

RHYME a a *

OF your Trouble, Ben, to ease me,
I will tell what Man would please me.
I would have him, if I could,
Noble; or of greater Blood:
Titles, I confess, do take me;
And a Woman God did make me,
French to boot, at least in fashion,
And his Manners of that Nation.
Young I'ld have him too, and fair,
Yet a Man; with crisped Hair,
Cast in thousand Snares and Rings,
For Love's Fingers, and his Wings:
Chesnut Colour, or more slack
Gold, upon a Ground of Black.
Venus and Minerva's Eyes,
For he must look wanton-wise.
Eye-brows bent, like Cupid's Bow,
Front, an ample Field of Snow;
Even Nose, and Cheek, (withal)
Smooth as is the Billiard Ball:
Chin as woolly as the Peach;
And his Lip should kissing teach,
Till he cherish'd too much Beard,
And make Love or me afeard.
He would have a Hand as soft
As the Down, and shew it oft;
Skin as smooth as any Rush,
And so thin to see a Blush
Rising through it, e're it came;
All his Blood should be a Flame,
Quickly fir'd, as in beginners
In Loves School, and yet no sinners.
'Twere too long to speak of all,
What we Harmony do call,
In a body should be there.
Well he should his Clothes to wear;
Yet no Taylor help to make him
Drest, you still for Man should take him,
And not think h' had eat a Stake,
Or were set up in a Brake.
Valiant he should be as fire,
Shewing danger more than Ire.
Bounteous as the Clouds to Earth,
And as honest as his Birth.
All his Actions to be such,
As to do nothing too much.
Nor o'er-praise, nor yet condem;
Nor out-value, nor contemn;
Nor do Wrongs, nor Wrongs receive;
Nor tie Knots, nor Knots unweave;
And from baseness to be free,
As he durst love Truth and Me.
Such a Man, with every part,
I could give my very Heart;
But of one, if short he came,
I can rest me where I am.

TITLE

RHYME a a *

FOr his Mind, I do not care,
That's a Toy that I could spare:
Let his Title be but great,
His Clothes rich, and Band sit neat,
Himself young, and Face be good,
All I wish is understood.
What you please, you parts may call,
'Tis one good part I'ld lie withal.

Of Reason empty is!

To fall again; at such a Feast,
Mistaking Earth for Heaven.

MEn, if you love us, play no more
The Fools, or Tyrants with your Friends,
To make us still sing o'er and o'er,
Our own false Praises, for your Ends:
We have both Wits, and Fancies too,
And if we must, let's sing of you.

RHYME a b a b c c

Nor do we doubt, but that we can,
If we would search with care and pain,
Find some one good, in some one Man;
So going thorow all your Strain,
We shall at last, of parcels make
One good enough for a Songs sake.

RHYME a b a b c c

And as a cunning Painter takes
In any curious Piece you see
More pleasure while the thing he makes,
Than when 'tis made, why, so will we.
And having pleas'd our Art, we'll try
To make a new, and hang that by.

HAng up those dull, and envious Fools
That talk abroad of Womans change,
We were not bred to sit on Stools,
Our proper Vertue is to range:
Take that away, you take our Lives,
We are no Women then, but Wives.

RHYME a b a b c c

Such as in Valour would excel,
Do change, though Man, and often fight,
Which we in Love must do as well,
If ever we will love aright.
The frequent varying of the Deed,
Is that which doth Perfection breed.

RHYME a b a b c c

Nor is't Inconstancy to change
For what is better, or to make
(By searching) what before was strange,
Familiar, for the uses sake:
The good, from bad, is not descri'd,
But as 'tis often vext and tri'd.

And this Profession of a Store
In Love, doth not alone help forth
Our Pleasure; but preserves us more
From being forsaken, than doth worth:
For were the worthiest Woman curst
To love one Man, he'd leave her first.

RHYME a b a b c c c

ILove, and he loves me again,
Yet dare I not tell who;
For if the Nymphs should know my Swain,
I fear they'd love him too;
Yet if it be not known,
The Pleasure is as good as none,
For that's a narrow Joy is but our own.

RHYME a b a b c c c

I'll tell, that if they be not glad,
They yet may envy me:
But then if I grow jealous mad,
And of them pitied be,
It were a plague 'bove Scorn,
And yet it cannot be forborn,
Unless my heart would as my thought be torn.

RHYME a b a b c c c

He is, if they can find him, fair,
And fresh and fragrant too,
As Summers Sky, or purged Air,
And looks as Lilies do,
That are this Morning blown;
Yet, yet I doubt he is not known,
And fear much more, that more of him be shown.

RHYME a b a b c c c

But he hath Eyes so round, and bright,
As make away my doubt,
Where Love may all his Torches light,
Though Hate had put them out:
But then t' increase my fears,
What Nymph soe'er his Voice but hears,
Will be my Rival, though she have but Ears.

RHYME a b a b c c c

I'll tell no more, and yet I love,
And he loves me; yet no
One unbecoming thought doth move
From either Heart, I know;
But so exempt from blame,
As it would be to each a Fame:
If Love, or Fear, would let me tell his Name.

RHYME a a b b b 

And in his Mrs.Mistress' Flame, playing like a Fly,
Turn'd to Cinders by her Eye?

And every close did meet
In Sentence, of as subtil Feet,
As hath the youngest He,
That sits in shadow of Apollo's Tree.
Oh, but my conscious Fears,
That fly my thoughts between,
Tell me that she hath seen
My Hundreds of Gray Hairs,
Told Seven and Forty Years.
Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace
My Mountain Belly, and my Rocky Face,
And all these through her Eyes, have stopt her Ears.

WRetched and foolish Jealousie,
How cam'st thou thus to enter me?
I ne'er was of thy kind:
Nor have I yet the narrow Mind
To vent that poor desire,
That others should not warm them at my fire:
I wish the Sun should shine
On all Mens Fruits and Flowers, as well as mine.

RHYME a a *

But under the Disguise of Love,
Thou say'st, thou only cam'st to prove
What my affections were.
Think'st thou that Love is help'd by Fear?
Go, get thee quickly forth
Loves sickness, and his noted want of worth,
Seek doubting Men to please,
I ne'er will owe my Health to a Disease.

OR Scorn, or pity on me take,
I must the true Relation make,
I am undone to Night:
Love in a subtil Dream disguis'd,
Hath both my Heart and me surpris'd,
Whom never yet he durst attempt t' awake;
Nor will he tell me for whose sake
He did me the Delight,
Or Spight,
But leaves me to inquire,
In all my wild desire
Of sleep again, who was his aid,
And sleep so guilty and afraid,
As since he dares not come within my sight.

RHYME a a *

IHave my Piety too, which could
It vent it self, but as it would,
Would say as much, as both have done.
Before me here, the Friend and Son:
For I both lost a Friend and Father,
Of him whose bones this Grave doth gather:
Dear Vincent Corbet, who so long
Had wrestled with Diseases strong,
That though they did possess each Limb,
Yet he broke them, e're they could him:
With the just Canon of his Life,
A Life that knew nor Noise, nor Strife:
But was by sweetning so his Will,
All Order and Disposure, still
His Mind as pure, and neatly kept,
As were his Nourceries, and swept
So of Uncleanness, or Offence,
That never came ill odour thence!

RHYME a a *

And add his Actions unto these,
They were as specious as his Trees.
'Tis true, he could not reprehend
His very Manners, taught t' amend,
They were so even, grave, and holy;
No Stubbornness so stiff, nor Folly
To license ever was so light,
As twice to trespass in his sight:
His Looks would so correct it, when
It chid the Vice, yet not the Men.
Much from him, I profess, I won,
And more, and more, I should have done,
But that I understood him scant,
Now I conceive him by my want;
And pray who shall my sorrows read,
That they for me their Tears will shed;
For truly, since he left to be,
I feel, I'm rather dead than he!

RHYME a a *

Reader, whose Life, and Name, did e'er become
An Epitaph, deserv'd a Tomb:

Who makes the one, so 't be first, makes both.

IF Sackvile, all that have the power to do
Great and good Turns, as well could time them too,
And knew their how, and where: we should have then
Less list of proud, hard, or ingrateful Men.
For benefits are ow'd with the same Mind
As they are done, and such Returns they find:
You then whose Will not only, but Desire
To succour my Necessities, took fire,
Not at my Prayers, but your Sense; which laid
The way to meet, what others would upbraid;
And in the Act did so my blush prevent,
As I did feel it done, as soon as meant:
You cannot doubt, but I who freely know
This Good from you, as freely will it owe;
And though my Fortune humble me, to take
The smallest Courtesies with Thanks, I make
Yet choice from whom I take them; and would shame
To have such do me good, I durst not name:
They are the noblest benefits, and sink
Deepest in Man, of which when he doth think,
The Memory delights him more, from whom
Then what he hath receiv'd. Gifts stink from some;
They are so long a coming, and so hard,
Where any Deed is forc't, the Grace is marr'd.
Can I owe Thanks for Courtesies receiv'd
Against his Will that does 'em? That hath weav'd
Excuses, or Delays? or done 'em scant,
That they have more opprest me than my want?
Or if he did it not to succour me,
But by meer Chance? for Interest? or to free
Himself of farther trouble, or the weight
Of pressure, like one taken in a streight?
All this corrupts the thanks, less hath he won,
That puts it in his Debt-book ere't be done;
Or that doth sound a Trumpet, and doth call
His Grooms to witness; or else lets it fall
In that proud manner; as a good so gain'd,
Must make me sad for what I have obtain'd.
No! Gifts and Thanks should have one cheerful Face,
So each that's done, and tane, becomes a Brace.
He neither gives, or do's, that doth delay
A Benefit: or that doth throw't away,
No more than he doth thank, that will receive
Nought but in corners, and is loth to leave,
Lestrare form of 'Least' Air, or Print, but flies it: Such Men would
Run from the Conscience of it, if they could.

RHYME a a *

As I have seen some Infants of the Sword
Well known, and practis'd Borrowers on their Word,
Give thanks by stealth, and whispering in the Ear,
For what they straight would to the World forswear;
And speaking worst of those, from whom they went
But then, fist-fill'd, to put me off the scent.
Now dam' me, Sir, if you shall not command
My Sword ('tis but a poor Sword understand)
As far as any poor Sword i' the Land;
Then turning unto him is next at hand,
Dam's whom he damn'd too, is the veriest Gull,
H'as Feathers, and will serve a Man to pull.
Are they not worthy to be answer'd so,
That to such Natures let their full Hands flow,
And seek not wants to succour: but enquire,
Like Money-brokers, after Names, and hire
Their bounties forth, to him that last was made,
Or stands to be'n Commission o' the Blade?
Still, still the Hunters of false Fame apply
Their Thoughts and Means to making loud the Cry:
But one is bitten by the Dog he fed,
And hurt, seeks Cure; the Surgeon bids, take bread,
And Spunge-like, with it dry up the blood quite:
Then give it to the Hound that did him bite:
Pardon, says he, that were a way to see
All the Town-Curs take each their snatch at me.
O, is it so? knows he so much? and will
Feed those, at whom the Table points at still?
I not deny it, but to help the need
Of any, is a Great and Generous Deed:
Yea, of th' ingrateful: and he forth must tell
Many a Pound, and Piece will pace one well;
But these Men ever want: their very Trade
Is borrowing; that but stopt, they do invade
All as their Prize, turn Pyrates here at Land,
Ha' their Bermudas, and their Streights i' th' Strand:
Man out of their Boats to th' Temple, and not shift
Now, but command; make Tribute what was Gift;
And it is paid 'em with a trembling Zeal,
And Superstition, I dare scarce reveal,
If it were clear; but being so in Cloud
Carried and wrapt, I only am alow'd
My Wonder! Why? the taking a Clown's Purse,
Or robbing the poor Market-folks, should nurse
Such a Religious Horror in the Breasts
Of our Town-Gallantry! or why there rests
Such Worship due to kicking of a Punck!
Or swaggering with the Watch, or Drawer drunk;
Or feats of Darkness acted in Mid-Sun,
And told of with more License than th' were done!
Sure there is Mystery in it, I not know
That Men such Reverence to such actions show!
And almost Deifie the Authors! make
Loud Sacrifice of Drink, for their Healths-sake:
Rear Suppers in their Names! and spend whole Nights
Unto their Praise, in certain swearing Rites:
Cannot a Man be reck'ned in the State
Of Valour, but at this Idolatrous rate?
I thought that Fortitude had been a mean
'Twixt Fear and Rashness; not a Lust obscene,
Or appetite of offending, but a Skill,
Or Science of a discerning Good and Ill.
And you, Sir, know it well, to whom I write,
That with these Mixtures we put out her Light,
Her Ends are Honesty, and Publick Good!
And where they want, she is not understood.
No more are these of us, let them then go,
I have the list of mine own Faults to know,
Look too and cure: He's not a Man hath none,
But like to be, that every day mends one,
And feels it: Else he tarries by the Beast:
Can I discern how Shadows are decreast,
Or grown; by height or lowness of the Sun?
And can I less of Substance? when I run,

RHYME a a *

Ride, sail, am coach'd, know I how far I have gone.
And my Minds Motion not? or have I none:
No! he must feel and know, that I will advance.
Men have been great, but never good by chance,
Or on the sudden. It were strange, that he
Who was this Morning such a one, should be
Sydney ere Night? or that did go to bed
Coriat, should rise the most sufficient Head
Of Christendom? And neither of these know,
Were the Rack offer'd them, how they came so:
'Tis by degrees that Men arrive at glad
Profit, in ought each day some little add,
In time 'twill be a heap: This is not true
Alone in Money, but in Manners too.
Yet we must more than move still, or go on,
We must accomplish: 'Tis the last Key-stone
That makes the Arch; the rest that there were put
Are nothing till that comes to bind and shut.
Then stands it a triumphal Mark! then Men
Observe the strength, the height, the why, and when,
It was erected; and still walking under,
Meet some new Matter to look up and wonder!
Such Notes are Vertuous Men! they live as fast
As they are high; are rooted, and will last.
They need no Stilts, nor rise upon their Toes,
As if they would belie their stature; those
Are Dwarfs of Honour, and have neither weight
Nor fashion, if they chance aspire to height,
'Tis like light Canes, that first rise big and brave,
Shoot forth in smooth and comely spaces; have
But few and fair Divisions: but being got
Aloft, grow less and streightned; full of Knot.
And last, go out in nothing: You that see
Their difference, cannot choose which you will be.
You know (without my flatt'ring you) too much
For me to be your Indice. Keep you such,
That I may love your Person (as I do)
Without your Gift, though I can rate that too,
By thanking thus the Courtesie to life,
Which you will bury, but therein, the strife
May grow so great to be Example, when
(As their true Rule or Lesson) either Men
Donnor's or Donnee's to their practice shall
Find you to reckon nothing, me owe all.

IKnow to whom I write here, I am sure,
Though I am short, I cannot be obscure:
Less shall I for the Art or Dressing care,
Truth, and the Graces best, when naked are.
Your Book, my Selden, I have read, and much
Was trusted, that you thought my Judgment such
To ask it: Though in most of Works it be
A Penance, where a Man may not be free.
Rather than Office, when it doth, or may
Chance that the Friends affection proves allay
Unto the Censure. Yours all need doth fly
Of this so Vitious Humanity.
Than which there is not unto Study, a more
Pernicious Enemy, we see before
A many of Books, even good Judgments wound
Themselves through favouring what is there not found:
But I on yours far otherwise shall do,
Not fly the Crime, but the Suspicion too:
Though I confess (as every Muse hath err'd,
And mine not least) I have too oft preferr'd
Men past their terms, and prais'd some Names too much,
But 'twas with purpose to have made them such,
Since being deceiv'd, I turn a sharper Eye
Upon my self, and ask to whom? and why?
And what I write? and vex it many days
Before Men get a Verse; much less a Praise:

So that my Reader is assur'd, I now
Mean what I speak, and still will keep that Vow,
Stand forth my Object, then, you that have been
Ever at home; yet have all Countries seen:
And like a Compass, keeping one Foot still
Upon your Center, do your Circle fill
Of general Knowledge; watch'd Men, Manners too,
Heard what times past have said, seen what ours do:
Which Grace shall I make love to first? your Skill,
Or Faith in things? or is't your Wealth and Will
T' instruct and teach? or your unweary'd pain
Of Gathering? Bounty in pouring out again?
What Fables have you vext! what Truth redeem'd!
Antiquities search'd! Opinions dis-esteem'd!
Impostures branded, and Authorities urg'd,
What Blots and Errors have you watch'd and purg'd
Records and Authors of! how rectified,
Times, Manners, Customs! Innovations spied!
Sought out the Fountains, Sources, Creeks, Paths, Ways,
And noted the Beginnings and Decays!
Where is that Nominal Mark, or Real Rite,
Form, Act or Ensign, that hath scap'd your sight?
How are Traditions there examin'd! how
Conjectures retreiv'd! and a Story now
And then of Times (besides the bare Conduct
Of what it tells us) weav'd in to instruct.
I wonder'd at the Richness, but am lost,
To see the Workmanship so 'xceed the Cost!
To mark the excellent seas'ning of your Stile!
And Manly Elocution, not one while
With Horror rough, then rioting with Wit!
But to the Subject still the Colours fit,
In sharpness of all Search, wisdom of Choice,
Newness of Sense, Antiquity of Voice!
I yeild, I yeild, the matter of your Praise
Flows in upon me, and I cannot raise
A bank against it. Nothing but the round
Large clasp of Nature, such a Wit can bound
Monarch in Letters! 'Mongst thy Titles shown
Of others Honours, thus, enjoy their own,
I first salute thee so; and gratulate
With that thy Stile, thy keeping of thy State;
In offering this thy work to no great Name,
That would, perhaps, have prais'd, and thank'd the same,
But nought beyond. He thou hast given it to,
Thy Learned Chamber-fellow, knows to do
It true respects. He will not only love
Embrace and cherish; but he can approve
And estimate thy Pains; as having wrought
In the same Mines of Knowledge; and thence brought
Humanity enough to be a Friend,
And strength to be a Champion, and defend
Thy Gift 'gainst envy. O how I do count
Among my comings in, and see it mount
The Grain of your Two Friendships! Hayward and
Selden! Two Names that so much understand!
On whom I could take up, and ne'er abuse
The Credit, what would furnish a tenth Muse!
But here's no time, nor place, my Wealth to tell,
You both are modest. So am I. Farewel.

To gain upon his belly; and at last
Crush'd in the Snaky Brakes, that he had past!
See the grave, sower, and supercilious Sir,
In outward Face, but inward, light as Fur,
Or Feathers: lay his Fortune out to show,
Till Envy wound, or maim it at a blow!
See him that's call'd, and thought the happiest Man,
Honour'd at once, and envy'd (if it can
Be, Honour is so mixt) by such as would
For all their spight, be like him, if they could:
No part or corner Man can look upon,
But there are Objects bid him to be gone
As far as he can fly, or follow Day,
Rather than here so bogg'd in Vices stay,
The whole World here leaven'd with Madness swells?
And being a thing blown out of nought, rebels
Against his Maker; high alone with Weeds,
And impious Rankness of all Sects and Seeds:
Nor to be check'd, or frighted now with Fate,
But more licentious made, and desperate!
Our Delicacies are grown capital,
And even our Sports are Dangers! what we call
Friendship is now mask'd Hatred! Justice fled,
And Shamefac'dness together! All Laws dead
That kept Man living! Pleasures only sought!
Honour and Honesty, as poor things thought
As they are made! Pride and stiff Clownage mixt
To make up Greatness! and Mans whole good fix'd
In Bravery, or Gluttony, or Coyn,
All which he makes the Servants of the Groin,
Thither it flaws,flows how much did Stallion spend
To have his Court-bred-filly there commend
His Lace and Starch: And fall upon her back
In admiration, stretch'd upon the Rack
Of Lust, to his rich Suit and Title, Lord?
I, that's a Charm and half! She must afford
That all Respect; She must lie down: Nay, more,
'Tis there Civility to be a Whore;
He's one of Blood and Fashion! and with these
The Bravery makes, she can no Honour leese
To do't with Cloth, or Stuffs, Lusts Name might merit
With Velvet, Plush, and Tissues, it is Spirit.
O, these so ignorant Monsters! light, as proud,
Who can behold their Manners, and not Clowd-
Like upon them lighten? If Nature could
Not make a Verse, Anger or Laughter would,
To see 'em aye discoursing with their Glass,
How they may make some one that day an Ass,
Planting their Purls, and Curls, spread forth like Net,
And every Dressing for a Pitfall set
To catch the Flesh in, and to pound a Prick
Be at their Visits, see 'em squeamish, sick,
Ready to cast at one, whose Band sits ill,
And then leap mad on a neat Pickardill;
As if a Brize were gotten i' their Tail,
And firk, and jerk, and for the Coach-man rail,
And jealous each of other, yet think long
To be abroad, chanting some bawdy Song,
And laugh, and measure Thighs, then squeak, spring, itch,
Do all the Tricks of a salt Lady Bitch;
For t'other Pound of Sweet-meats, he shall feel
That pays, or what he will. The Dame is Steel;
For these with her young Company she'll enter,
Where Pittes, or Wright, or Modet would not venter,
And comes by these Degrees the Stile t' inherit,
Of Woman of Fashion, and a Lady of Spirit:

RHYME a a *

Nor is the Title question'd with our proud,
Great, brave, and fashion'd folk, these are allow'd
Adulteries now, are not so hid, or strange,
They're grown Commodity upon Exchange;
He that will follow but another's Wife,
Is lov'd, though he let out his own for life:
The Husband now's call'd churlish, or a poor
Nature, that will not let his Wife be a Whore;
Or use all Arts, or haunt all Companies
That may corrupt her, even in his Eyes.
The Brother trades a Sister; and the Friend
Lives to the Lord, but to the Ladies End.
Less must not be thought on than Mistris: or
If it be thought, kill'd like her Embrions; for
Whom no great Mistris, hath as yet infam'd
A Fellow of course Letchery, is nam'd
The Servant of the Serving-Woman in scorn,
Ne'er came to taste the plenteous Marriage-Horn.
Thus they do talk. And are these Objects fit
For Man to spend his Money on? his Wit?
His Time? Health? Soul? Will he for these go throw
Those Thousands on his Back, shall after blow
His Body to the Counters, or the Fleet?
Is it for these that fine Man meets the Street
Coach'd, or on Foot-cloth, thrice chang'd every day,
To teach each Suit, he has the ready way
From Hide-Park to the Stage, where at the last
His dear and borrow'd Bravery he must cast?
When not his Combs, his Curling-Irons, his Glass,
Sweet Bags, sweet Powders, nor sweet Words will pass
For less Security? O god for these
Is it that Man pulls on himself Disease?
Surfeit? and Quarrel? Drinks the tother Health?
Or by Damnation voids it? or by stealth?
What Fury of late is crept into our Feasts?
What Honour given to the Drunkennest Guests?
What Reputation to bear one Glass more?
When oft the Bearer is borne out of Door?
This hath our ill-us'd Freedom, and soft Peace
Brought on us, and will every Hour increase
Our Vices, do not tarry in a place,
But being in Motion still (or rather in Race)
Tilt one upon another, and now bear
This way, now that, as if their number were
More than themselves, or than our Lives could take,
But both fell prest under the load they make.
I'll bid thee look no more, but flee, flee Friend,
This Pr��cipice, and Rocks that have no end,
Or side, but threatens Ruin. The whole Day
Is not enough now, but the Nights to play:
And whilst our States, Strength, Body, and Mind we waste;
Go make our selves the Usurers at a cast.
He that no more for Age, Cramps, Palsies, can
Now use the Bones, we see doth hire a Man
To take the Box up for him; and pursues
The Dice with glassen Eyes, to the glad Viewers views
Of what he throws: Like Letchers grown content
To be beholders, when their Powers are spent.
Can we not leave this Worm? or will we not?
Is that the truer Excuse? or have we got
In this, and like, an itch of Vanity,
That scratching now's our best Felicity?
Well, let it go. Yet this is better than
To lose the Forms, and Dignities of Men,Man
To flatter my good Lord, and cry his Bowl
Runs sweetly, as it had his Lordship's Soul:
Although, perhaps it has, what's that to me,
That may stand by, and hold my peace? will he
When I am hoarse, with praising his each Cast,
Give me but that again, that I must waste
In Sugar Candid, or in butter'd Beer,
For the recovery of my Voice? No, there
Pardon his Lordship. Flatt'ry's grown so cheap
With him, for he is followed with that heap,

RHYME a a *

That watch, and catch, at what they may applaud
As a poor single Flatterer, without Bawd
Is nothing, such scarce Meat and Drink he'll give,
But he that's both, and slave to both, shall live,
And be belov'd, while the Whores last. O Times,
Friend fly from hence, and let these kindled Rhymes,
Light thee from Hell on Earth; where Flatterers, Spies,
Informers, Masters both of Arts and Lies;
Lewd Slanderers, soft Whisperers, that let blood
The life, and Fame-Veins (yet not understood
Of the poor Sufferers) where the envious, proud,
Ambitious, factious, superstitious, loud
Boasters, and perjur'd, with the infinite more
Pr��varicators swarm: Of which the Store,
(Because th'are every where amongst Mankind
Spread through the World) is easier far to find,
Than once to number, or bring forth to hand,
Though thou wert Muster-Master of the Land.
Go quit 'em all. And take along with thee,
Thy true Friends Wishes, Colby which shall be,
That thine be just, and honest, that thy Deeds
Not wound thy Conscience, when thy Body bleeds;
That thou dost all things more for Truth than Glory,
And never but for doing Wrong be sorry;
That by commanding first thy self, thou mak'st
Thy Person fit for any Charge thou tak'st,
That Fortune never make thee to complain,
But what she gives, thou dar'st give her again:
That whatsoever Face thy Fate puts on,
Thou shrink, or start not; but be always one,
That thou think nothing great, but what is good;
And from that thought strive to be understood.
So, 'live or dead, thou wilt preserve a Fame
Still precious, with the Odour of thy Name.
And last, blaspheme not, we did never hear
Man thought the valianter, 'cause he durst swear;
No more, than we should think a Lord had had
More Honour in him, 'cause we'ave known him mad:
These take, and now go seek thy peace in War,
Who falls for love of God, shall rise a Star.

THey are not, Sir, worst Owers, that do pay
Debts when they can: good men may break their day;
And yet the noble Nature never grudge,
'Tis then a Crime, when the Usurer is Judge,
And he is not in Friendship. Nothing there
Is done for Gain: If't be, 'tis not sincere.
Nor should I at this time protested be,
But that some greater Names have broke with me,
And their Words too; where I but break my Band,
I add that (but) because I understand
That as the lesser breach: for he that takes
Simply my Band, his trust in me forsakes,
And looks unto the Forfeit. If you be
Now so much Friend, as you would trust in me,
Venture a longer time, and willingly:
All is not barren Land doth fallow lie:
Some Grounds are made the richer for the Rest;
And I will bring a Crop, if not the best.

CAn Beauty that did prompt me first to write,
Now threaten, with those means she did invite:
Did her perfections call me on to gaze!
Then like, then love; and now would they amaze!
Or was she gracious a-far off? but near
A terror? or is all this but my fear?
That as the Water makes things, put in't, streight,
Crooked appear; so that doth my conceit:
I can help that with boldness; and Love swear,
And Fortune once, t' assist the Spirits that dare.
But which shall lead me on? both these are blind:
Such Guides men use not, who their way would find.
Except the way be error to those ends:
And then the best are still, the blindest Friends!
Oh how a Lover may mistake! to think,
Or love, or fortune blind, when they but wink
To see men fear: or else for truth, and state,
Because they would free Justice imitate,
Vail their own Eyes, and would impartially
Be brought by us to meet our Destiny.
If it be thus; Come Love, and Fortune go,
I'll lead you on; or if my fate will so,
That I must send one first, my Choice assigns,
Love to my Heart, and Fortune to my Lines.

RHYME a a *

BY those bright Eyes, at whose immortal fires
Love lights his Torches to inflame desires;
By that fair stand, your Forehead, whence he bends
His double Bow, and round his Arrows sends;
By that tall Grove, your Hair, whose globy rings
He flying curles and crispeth with his Wings.
By those pure Bathes your either Cheek discloses,
Where he doth steep himself in Milk and Roses;
And lastly by your Lips, the bank of kisses,
Where men at once may plant and gather blisses:
Tell me (my lov'd Friend) do you love or no?
So well as I may tell in Verse, 'tis so?
You blush, but do not: Friends are either none,
(Though they may number bodies) or but one.
I'll therefore ask no more, but bid you love,
And so that either may example prove
Unto the other; and live Patterns, how
Others, in time may love, as we do now.
Slip no occasion; as time stands not still,
I know no Beauty, nor no Youth that will.
To use the present, then, is not abuse,
You have a Husband is the just excuse
Of all that can be done him; such a one
As would make shift, to make himself alone,
That which we can, who both in you, his Wife,
His Issue, and all Circumstance of life,
As in his place, because he would not vary,
Is constant to be extraordinary.

Think but the Sin of all her Sex, 'tis she!

Perjur'd! and painted! if she were no more
But she is such, as she might yet forestall
The Devil, and be the damning of us all.

Of all Vice hurld together, there he was,
Proud, false, and treacherous, vindictive, all

When those good few, that her Defenders be,
Are there for Charity, and not for Fee.
Such shall you hear to Day, and find great Foes
Both arm'd with Wealth, and slander to oppose,
Who thus long safe, would gain upon the times
A right by the prosperity of their Crimes;
Who, though their Guilt, and Perjury they know,
Think, yea and boast, that they have done it so,
As though the Court pursues them on the scent,
They will come of,off and scape the Punishment;
When this appears, just Lord, to your sharp sight,
He do's you wrong, that craves you to do right.

THat I hereafter, do not think the Bar,
The Seat made of a more than Civil War;
Or the great Hall at Westminster, the Field
Where mutual frauds are fought, and no side yield,
That henceforth, I believe nor Books, nor Men,
Who 'gainst the Law, weave Calumnies my Benn
But when I read or hear the names so rife,
Of Hirelings, Wranglers, Stitchers-to of strife,
Hook-handed Harpies, gowned Vultures, put
Upon the reverend Pleaders; do now shut
All Mouthes, that dare entitle them (from hence)
To the Wolves study, or Dogs eloquence;
Thou art my Cause: whose manners since I knew,
Have made me to conceive a Lawyer new.
So dost thou study Matter, Men, and Times,
Mak'st it Religion to grow rich by Crimes!
Dar'st not abuse thy Wisdom, in the Laws,
Or Skill to carry out an evil Cause!
But first doth vex, and search it! If nor sound,
Thou prov'st the gentler ways, to cleanse the wound,
And make the Scar fair; If that will not be,
Thou hast the brave scorn, to put back the fee!
But in a business, that will bide the touch,
What use, what strength of reason! and how much
Of Books, of Precedents hast thou at hand?
As if the general store thou didst command
Of Argument, still drawing forth the best,
And not being borrowed by thee, but possest.
So com'st thou like a Chief into the Court
Arm'd at all Pieces, as to keep a Fort
Against a multitude; and (with thy Stile
So brightly brandish'd) wound'st, defend'st! the while
Thy Adversaries fall, as not a word
They had, but were a Reed unto thy Sword.
Then com'st thou off with Victory and Palm,
Thy Hearers Nectar, and thy Clients Balm,
The Courts just Honour, and thy Judges Love.
And (which doth all Atchievements get above)
Thy sincere practise, breeds not thee a Fame
Alone, but all thy rank a reverend Name.

Her own Blood gave her: She ne'er had, nor hath
Any belief, in Madam Baud-bees Bath,
Or Turners Oil of Talk. Nor ever got
Spanish Receipt, to make her Teeth to rot.
What was the cause then? Thought'st thou in disgrace,

On which with profit, I shall never look,
But must confess from whom what gift I took.

RHYME a a a

Not like your Country Neighbours, that commit
Their vice of loving for a Christmas fit;
Which is indeed but friendship of the Spit:

And which you (being the worthier) gave me leave
In Letters, that mix Spirits, thus to weave.

So may the fruitful Vine my Temples steep,
And Fame wake for me, when I yield to sleep.

Rigid, and harsh, which is a Drug austere

That friendship which no chance but love did choose,
Will unto License that fair leave abuse.

In practis'd friendship wholly to reprove,
As flatt'ry with Friends humours still to move.

Yet if with eithers Vice I tainted be,
Forgive it, as my frailty, and not me.

RHYME a a *

TIs true, I'am broke! Vows, and all I had
Of Credit lost. And I am now run mad;
Or do upon my self some desperate ill;
This sadness makes no approaches, but to kill.
It is a Darkness hath blockt up my sense,
And drives it in to eat on my offence,
Or there to starve it. Help O you that may
Alone lend succours, and this fury stay.
Offended Mistris, you are yet so fair,
As Light breaks from you, that affrights despair,
And fills my powers with perswading joy,
That you should be too noble to destroy.
There may some face or menace of a storm
Look forth, but cannot last in such a form.
If there be nothing worthy you can see
Of graces, or your mercy here in me,
Spare your own goodness yet; and be not great
In will and power, only to defeat.
God, and the good, know to forgive, and save.
The ignorant, and fools, no pity have.
I will not stand to justifie my fault,
Or lay the excuse upon the Vinter's Vault;
Or in confessing of the Crime be nice,
Or go about to countenance the vice,
By naming in what company 'twas in,
As I would urge Authority for sin.
No, I will stand arraign'd, and cast, to be
The subject of your Grace in pardoning me,
And (stil'd your mercies Creature) will live more
Your honour now, than your disgrace before,
Think it was frailty, Mistris, think me Man,
Think that your self like Heaven forgive me can,
Where Weakness doth offend, and Vertue grieve,
There Greatness takes a glory to relieve.
Think that I once was yours, or may be now;
Nothing is vile, that is a part of you.
Errour and Folly in me may have crost
Your just Commands; yet those, not I be lost.
I am regenerate now, become the Child
Of your Compassion; Parents should be mild:
There is no Father that for one demerit,
Or two, or three, a Son will disinherit;
That is the last of Punishments is meant;
No Man inflicts that Pain, till Hope be spent:
An ill-affected Limb (what e'er it ail)
We cut not off, till all Cures else do fail;

RHYME a a *

And then with pause; for sever'd once, that's gone,
Would live his Glory that could keep it on.
Do not despair my mending; to distrust
Before you prove a Med'cine, is unjust:
You may so place me, and in such an Air,
As not alone the Cure, but Scar be fair.
That is, if still your Favours you apply,
And not the Bounties you have done, deny.
Could you demand the Gifts you gave, again!
Why was't? Did e'er the Clouds ask back their Rain?
The Sun, his Heat and Light? the Air his Dew?
Or Winds the Spirit by which the Flower so grew?
That were to wither all, and make a Grave
Of that wise Nature would a Cradle have.
Her Order is to cherish, and preserve;
Consumption's, Nature to destroy and starve.
But to exact again what once is given,
Is Natures meer Obliquity; as Heaven
Should ask the Blood and Spirits he hath infus'd
In Man, because Man hath the Flesh abus'd.
O may your Wisdom take example hence,
God lightens not at Man's each frail Offence:
He pardons Slips, goes by a World of Ills,
And then his Thunder frights more than it kills.
He cannot angry be, but all must quake;
It shakes even him, that all things else doth shake.
And how more fair and lovely looks the World
In a calm Sky, than when the Heaven is hurl'd
About in Clouds, and wrapt in raging Weather,
As all with Storm and Tempest ran together?
O imitate that sweet Serenity
That makes us live, not that which calls to die
In dark and sullen Morns; do we not say,
This looketh like an Execution day?
And with the Vulgar doth it not obtain
The name of Cruel Weather, Storm, and Rain?
Be not affected with these Marks too much
Of Cruelty, lest they do make you such.
But view the mildness of your Makers State,
As I the Penitents here emulate.
He, when he sees a Sorrow, such as this,
Streight puts off all his Anger, and doth kiss
The contrite Soul, who hath no thought to win
Upon the hope to have another Sin
Forgiven him: And in that Line stand I,
Rather than once displease you more, to die,
To suffer Tortures, Scorn, and Infamy,
What Fools, and all their Parasites can apply;
The Wit of Ale, and Genius of the Malt
Can pump for, or a Libel without Salt
Produce; though threatning with a Coal, or Chalk,
On every Wall, and sung where-e'er I walk.
I number these, as being of the Chore
Of Contumely, and urge a good Man more
Than Sword, or Fire, or what is of the Race
To carry noble Danger in the Face:
There is not any punishment, or pain,
A Man should fly from, as he would disdain.
Then Masters here, here let your Rigour end,
And let your Mercy make me asham'd t' offend.
I will no more abuse my Vows to you,
Than I will study Falshood, to be true.
O, that you could but by dissection see
How much you are the better part of me;
How all my Fibres by your Spirit do move,
And that there is no Life in me, but Love.
You would be then most confident, that tho
Publick Affairs command me now to go
Out of your Eyes, and be a while away;
Absence, or Distance, shall not breed decay.
Your Form shines here, here fixed in my Heart:
I may dilate my self, but not depart.
Others by common Stars their Courses run,
When I see you, then I do see my Sun:

RHYME a a *

Till then 'tis all but Darkness, that I have;
Rather than want your Light, I wish a Grave.

TO make the Doubt clear, that no Woman's true,
Was it my Fate to prove it full in you.
Thought I but one had breath'd the purer Air,
And must she needs be false, because she's fair?
It is your Beauties Mark, or of your Youth,
Or your Perfection, not to study Truth;
Or think you Heaven is deaf, or hath no Eyes?
Or those it has, wink at your Perjuries?
Are Vows so cheap with Women? or the matter
Whereof they are made, that they are writ in Water,
And blown away with Wind? or doth their Breath
Both hot and cold at once, threat Life and Death?
Who could have thought so many Accents sweet
Tun'd to our Words, so many Sighs should meet
Blown from our Hearts, so many Oaths and Tears
Sprinkled among? all sweeter by our Fears,
And the divine Impression of stoln Kisses,
That seal'd the rest, could now prove empty Blisses?
Did you draw Bonds to forfeit? sign to break?
Or must we read you quite from what you speak,
And find the Truth out the wrong way? or must
He first desire you false, would wish you just?
O, I profane! Though most of Women be,
The common Monster, Love, shall except thee,
My dearest Love, however Jealousie
With Circumstance might urge the contrary,
Sooner I'll think the Sun would cease to chear
The teeming Earth, and that forget to bear;
Sooner that Rivers would run back, or Thames
With Ribs of Ice in June would bind his Streams:
Or Nature, by whose strength the World endures,
Would change her Course, before you alter yours.
But, O that treacherous Breast, to whom weak you
Did trust our Counsels, and we both may rue,
Having his Falshood found too late! 'twas he
That made me cast you Guilty, and you me.
Whilst he, black Wretch, betray'd each simple VVord
VVe spake unto the coming of a third!
Curst may he be that so our Love hath slain,
And wander wretched on the Earth, as Cain:
VVretched as he, and not deserve least pity:
In plaguing him, let Misery be witty.
Let all Eyes shun him, and he shun each Eye,
Till he be noisom as his Infamy:
May he without remorse deny God thrice,
And not be trusted more on his Soul's price:
And after all self-torment, when he dies,
May Wolves tear out his Heart, Vultures his Eyes,
Swine eat his Bowels, and his falser Tongue,
That utter'd all, be to some Raven flung:
And let his Carrion Coarse be a longer Feast
To the King's Dogs, than any other Beast.
Now I have curst, let us our Love receive;
In me the Flame was never more alive.
I could begin again to court and praise,
And in that Pleasure lengthen the short days
Of my Lifes Lease; like Painters that do take
Delight, not in made Works, but whilst they make.
I could renew those Times, when first I saw
Love in your Eyes, that gave my Tongue the Law
To like what you lik'd, and at Masques, or Plays,
Commend the self-same Actors, the same Ways,
Ask how you did, and often with intent
Of being officious, grow impertinent;
All which were such lost Pastimes, as in these
Love was as subtly catch'd as a Disease.
But, being got, it is a Treasure, sweet,
Which to defend, is harder than to get;

RHYME a a *

And ought not be profan'd on either part,
For though 'tis got by Chance, 'tis kept by Art.

THat Love's a bitter-sweet, I ne'er conceive,
Till the sowr Minute comes of taking leave,
And then I taste it. But as Men drink up
In haste the bottom of a med'cin'd Cup,
And take some Sirrup after; so do I,
To put all rellish from my memory
Of parting, drown it, in the hope to meet
Shortly again, and make our absence sweet.
This makes me, Mistris, that sometimes by stealth,
Under another Name, I take your Health,
And turn the Ceremonies of those Nights
I give, or owe my Friends, into your Rites;
But ever without Blazon, or least Shade
Of Vows so sacred, and in silence made:
For though Love thrive, and may grow up with chear,
And free Society, he's born elsewhere,
And must be bred, so to conceal his Birth,
As neither Wine do rack it out, or Mirth.
Yet should the Lover still be airy and light
In all his Actions, rarified to Sprite;
Not, like a Midas, shut up in himself,
And turning all he toucheth into Pelf,
Keep in reserv'd in his Dark-lantern Face,
As if that exc'lent Dulness were Loves Grace:
No, Masters, no, the open merry Man
Moves like a spritely River, and yet can
Keep secret in his Channels what he breeds,
'Bove all your standing Waters, choak'd with Weeds.
They look at best like Cream-bowls, and you soon
Shall find their depth, they're sounded with a Spoon.
They may say Grace, and for Loves Chaplains pass;
But the grave Lover ever was an Ass,
Is fix'd upon one Leg, and dares not come
Out with the other, for he's still at home:
Like the dull wearied Crane, that (come on Land)
Doth while he keeps his Watch, betray his Stand;
Where he that knows, will like a Lapwing fly
Far from the Nest, and so himself belie
To others, as he will deserve the Trust
Due to that one that doth believe him just.
And such your Servant is, who vows to keep
The Jewel of your Name, as close as Sleep
Can lock the Sense up, or the Heart a Thought,
And never be by Time or Folly brought,
Weakness of Brain, or any Charm of Wine,
The Sin of Boast, or other Countermine,
(Made to blow up Loves Secrets) to discover
That Article may not become our Lover:
Which in assurance to your Breast I tell,
If I had writ no word, but Dear, farewel.

SInce you must go, and I must bid Farewell,
Hear, 'Mistress' your departing Servant tell
What it is like: And do not think they can
Be idle Words, though of a parting Man;
It is as if a Night should shade Noon-day,
Or that the Sun was here, but forc't away;
And we were left under that Hemisphere,
Where we must feel it dark for half a Year.
What Fate is this, to change Mens Days and Hours,
To shift their Seasons, and destroy their Powers!
Alas! I ha' lost my Heat, my Blood, my Prime,
Winter is come a Quarter e'er his time,
My Health will leave me; and when you depart,
How shall I do, sweet Mistris, for my Heart?

RHYME a a *

You would restore it? No, that's worth a fear,
As if it were not worthy to be there:
O, keep it still; for it had rather be
Your Sacrifice, than here remain with me.
And so I spare it, Come what can become
Of me, I'll softly tread unto my Tomb;
Or like a Ghost walk silent amongst Men,
Till I may see both it and you agen.

LEt me be what I am; as Virgil, cold;
As Horace, fat; or as Anacreon, old;
No Poets Verses yet did ever move,
Whose Readers did not think he was in love.
Who shall forbid me then in Rhyme to be
As light and active as the youngest he
That from the Muses Fountains doth indorse
His Lines, and hourly sits the Poets Horse.
Put on my Ivy Garland, let me see
Who frowns, who jealous is, who taxeth me,
Fathers and Husbands, I do claim a Right
In all that is call'd lovely: take my sight
Sooner than my affection from the Fair.
No Face, no Hand, Proportion, Line, or Air
Of Beauty, but the Muse hath interest in:
There is not worn that Lace, Purl, Knot, or Pin,
But is the Poets Matter; and he must
When he is furious, love, although not lust.
But then content, your Daughters and your Wives
(If they be fair and worth it) have their Lives
Made longer by our Praises: or, if not,
Wish, you had foul ones, and deformed got,
Curst in their Cradles, or there chang'd by Elves,
So to be sure you do enjoy your selves.
Yet keep those up in Sackcloth too, or Leather,
For Silk will draw some sneaking Songster thither.
It is a Rhyming Age, and Verses swarm
At every Stall; the City Cap's a Charm.
But I who live, and have liv'd twenty Year
Where I may handle Silk, as free, and near,
As any Mercer, or the Whalebone-man
That quilts those Bodies I have leave to span;
Have eaten with the Beauties, and the Wits,
And Braveries of Court, and felt their Fits
Of Love and Hate; and came so nigh to know
Whether their Faces were their own, or no.
It is not likely I should now look down
Upon a Velvet Petticoat, or a Gown,
Whose like I have known the Taylor's Wife put on,
To do her Husband's Rites in, e'er 'twere gone
Home to the Customer: his Letchery
Being, the best Clothes still to preoccupy.
Put a Coach-mare in Tissue, must I horse
Her presently? or leap thy Wife of force,
When by thy sordid Bounty she hath on
A Gown of that was the Caparison?
So I might dote upon thy Chairs and Stools,
That are like cloth'd: Must I be of those Fools
Of race accounted, that no Passion have,
But when thy Wife (as thou conceiv'st) is brave?
Then ope thy Wardrobe, think me that poor Groom
That from the Foot-man, when he was become
An Officer there, did make most solemn Love
To ev'ry Petticoat he brush'd, and Glove
He did lay up, and would adore the Shooe
Or Slipper was left off, and kiss it too;
Court every hanging Gown, and after that
Lift up some one, and do, I tell not what.
Thou didst tell me, and wert o'er-joy'd to peep
In at a hole, and see these Actions creep
From the poor Wretch, which though he plaid in Prose,
He would have done in Verse, with any one of those

Wrung on the Withers, by Lord Loves despight,
Had he had the Faculty to read and write!
Such Songsters there are store of; witness he
That chanc'd the Lace, laid on a Smock, to see,
And streight-way spent a Sonnet; with that other
That (in pure Madrigal) unto his Mother
Commended the French-Hood, and Scarlet Gown
The Lady Mayress pass'd in through the Town,
Unto the Spittle Sermon. O, what strange
Variety of Silks were on th' Exchange!
Or in Moore-fields! this other night, sings one,
Another answers, Lass those Silks are none
In smiling L'envoye, as he wou'd deride
Any Comparison had with his Cheap-side.
And vouches both the Pageant, and the Day,
When not the Shops, but Windows do display
The Stuffs, the Velvets, Plushes, Fringes, Lace,
And all the original Riots of the Place:
Let the poor Fools enjoy their Follies, love
A Goat in Velvet; or some Block could move
Under that cover; an old Mid-wives Hat!
Or a Close-stool so cas'd; or any fat
Bawd, in a Velvet Scabber'd! I envy
None of their Pleasures! nor will ask thee, why
Thou art jealous of thy Wives, or Daughters Case:
More than of eithers Manners, Wit, or Face!

What had I done that might call on thine Ire?
Or urge thy greedy Flame, thus to devour
So many my Years-labours in an hour?
I ne're attempted Vulcan 'gainst thy Life;
Nor made least Line of Love to thy loose Wife;
Or in remembrance of thy afront, and scorn
With Clowns, and Tradesmen, kept thee clos'd in Horn.
'Twas Jupiter that hurl'd thee headlong down,
And Mars, that gave thee a Lanthorn for a Crown:
Was it because thou wert of old denied
By Jove to have Minerva for thy Bride.
That since thou tak'st all envious care and pain,
To ruine any Issue of the Brain?
Had I wrote Treason there, or Heresie,
Imposture, Whitchcraft, Charms, or Blasphemy?
I had deserv'd then, thy consuming Looks,
Perhaps, to have been burned with my Books.
But, on thy Malice, tell me, didst thou spy
Any, least loose, or surrilescurrile Paper, lye
Conceal'd, or kept there, that was fit to be,
By thy own Vote, a Sacrifice to thee?
Did I there wound the Honours of the Crown?
Or tax the Glories of the Church and Gown?
Itch to defame the State? or brand the Times?
And my self most, in some self-boasting Rhymes?
If none of these, then why this Fire? Or find
A Cause before; or leave me one behind.
Had I compil'd from Amadis de Gaule,
Th' Esplandians, Arthur's, Palmerins, and all
The learned Library of Don Quixote;
And so some goodlier Monster had begot,
Or spun out Riddles, and weav'd fittyfifty Tomes

Or pomp'd for those hard Trifles Anagrams,
Or Eteostichs, or those finer Flams
Of Eggs, and Halberds, Cradles, and a Hearse,
A pair of Scisars, and a Comb in Verse;
Acrostichs, and Telestichs, on jump Names,
Thou then hadst had some colour for thy Flames,
On such my serious Follies; But, thou'lt say,

And as false stamp there; parcels of a Play,

With some more thrift, and more variety:
Thou mightst have had me perish, piece by piece
To light Tobacco, or save roasted Geese.
Sindge Capons, or poor Piggs, droping their Eyes;
Condemn'd me to the Ovens with the Pies;
And so, have kept me dying a whole Age,
Not ravish'd all hence in a Minutes rage.
But that's a mark, whereof thy Rights do boast,
To make Consumption, ever where thou go'st;
Had I fore-known of this thy least desire
T' have held a Triumph, or a Feast of Fire,
Especially in Paper; that, that steam
Had tickled your large Nostril: many a Ream
To redeem mine, I had sent in enough,
Though should'st have cry'd, and all been proper Stuff.

With Pieces of the Legend; The whole sum
Of Errant Knight-hood, with the Dames, and Dwarfs;
The charmed Boats, and the inchanted Wharfs,
The Tristram's, Lanc'lots, Turpins, and the Peer's,
All the mad Rolands, and sweet Oliveer's;
To Merlins Marvails, and his Caballs loss,
With the Chim��ra of the Rosie-Cross,
Their Seals, their Characters, Hermetick Rings,
Their Jem of Riches, and bright Stone, that brings
Invisibility, and strength, and Tongues:
The Art of kindling the true Coal, by Lungs,
With Nicholas Pasquill's, Medle with your match,
And the strong Lines, that so the time do catch,
Or Captain Pamphlets Horse, and Foot; that sally
Upon th' Exchange, still out of Popes-head-Alley.
The weekly Corrants, with Poules Seal; and all
The admir'd discourses of the Prophet Ball:
These, had'st thou pleas'd either to dine or sup,
Had made a Meal for Vulcan to lick up.
But in my Desk, what was there to accite
So ravenous and vast an Appetite?
I dare not say a Body, but some Parts

Whom Faction had not drawn to study sides.
How in these Ruins Vulcan, thou dost lurk,
All Soot and Embers! odious, as thy work!
I now begin to doubt, if ever Grace,
Or Goddess, could be patient of thy Face.
Thou woo Minerva! or to wit aspire!
'Cause thou canst halt, with us in Arts and Fire!
Son of the Wind! for so thy Mother gone
With Lust conceiv'd thee; Father thou hadst none.
When thou wert born, and that thou look'st at best,
She durst not kiss, but flung thee from her Breast.
And so did Jove, who ne're meant thee his Cup:
No marl the Clowns of Lemnos took thee up.
For none but Smiths would have made thee a God.
Some Alchimist there may be yet, or odd

Squire of the Squibs, against the Pageant day,
May to thy name a Vulcanale say;
And for it lose his Eyes with Gun-powder,
As th' other may his Brains with Quick-silver.
Well-fare the Wise-man yet, on the Banck-side,
My Friends, the Water-men! They could provide
Against thy Fury, when to serve their needs,
They made a Vulcan of a Sheaf of Reeds,
Whom they durst handle in their Holy-day Coats,
And safely trust to dress, not burn their Boats.
But, O those Reeds! thy meer disdain of them,
Made thee beget that cruel Stratagem,
(Which, some are pleas'd to stile but thy mad Pranck)
Against the Globe, the Glory of the Bank.
Which, though it were the Fort of the whole Parish,
Flanck'd with a Ditch, and forc'd out of a Marish,
I saw with two poor Chambers taken in
And raz'd; e're thought could urge, this might have been!
See the World's Ruines! nothing but the Piles
Left! and wit since to cover it with Tiles.
The Brethren, they streight nois'd it out for News,
'Twas verily some Relick of the Stews.
And this a Sparkle of that Fire let loose,
That was lock'd up in the Winchestrian Goose,
Bred on the Banck, in time of Popery,
When Venus there maintain'd in Mystery.
But, others fell, with that conceit by the Ears,
And cry'd, it was a threatning to the Bears,
And that accursed Ground, the Parish Garden:
Nay, sigh'd, ah Sister 'twas the Nun, Kate Arden
Kindled the Fire! But, then did one return,
No Fool would his own harvest spoil, or burn!
If that were so, thou rather would'st advance
The Place, that was thy Wives Inheritance.
O no, cry'd all. Fortune, for being a Whore,
Scap'd not his Justice and Jot the more:
He burnt that Idol of the Revels too:
Nay, let White-Hall with Revels have to do,
Though but in Dances, it shall know his Power;
There was a Judgment shew'n too in an Hour.
He is true Vulcan still! He did not spare
Troy, though it were so much his Venus care.
Fool, wilt thou let that in Example come?
Did not she save from thence, to build a Rome?
And what hast thou done in these petty Spights,
More then advanc'd the Houses, and their Rights?
I will not argue thee, from those of guilt,
For they were burnt, but to be better built.
'Tis true, that in thy wish they were destroy'd,
Which thou hast only vented, not enjoy'd.
So would'st th' have run upon the Rolls by stealth,
And didst invade part of the Common-wealth,
In those Records, which were all Chronicles gone,
Will be remembred by Six Clerks, to one.
But, say all Six, Good Men, what answer ye?
Lyes there no Writ, out of the Chancery,
Against this Vulcan? No Injunction?
No Order? no Decree? Though we be gone
At Common-Law, Methinks in his despight
A Court of Equity should do us right.
But to confine him to the Brew-houses,
The Glass-house, Dye-fats, and their Furnaces;
To live in Sea-coal, and go forth in Smoke;
Or lest that Vapour might the City choak,
Condemn him to the Brick-kills, or some Hill-
Foot (out in Sussex) to an Iron Mill;
Or in small Fagots have him blaze about
Vile Taverns, and the Drunkards piss him out;
Or in the Bell-Mans Lanthorn like a Spy,
Burn to a Snuff, and then stink out and dye:
I could invent a Sentence, yet were worse;
But I'll conclude all in a civil Curse.
Pox on your Flameship, Vulcan; if it be
To all as fatal as't hath been to me,

RHYME a a *

And to Pauls-Steeple; which was unto us
'Bove all your Fire-works, had at Ephesus,
Or Alexandria; and though a Divine
Loss remains yet, as unrepair'd as mine.
Would you had kept your Forge, at ��tna still,
And there made Swords, Bills, Glaves, and Arms your fill.
Maintain'd the Trade at Bilbo; or else-where;
Struck in at Millan with the Cutlers there;
Or stay'd but where the Fryar, and you first met,
Who from the Divels-Arse did Guns beget,
Or fixt in the Low-Country's, where you might
On both sides do your mischiefs with delight;
Blow up, and ruine, mine, and countermine,
Make your Petards, and Granats, all your fine
Engines of Murder, and receive the Praise
Of massacring Man-kind so many ways.
We ask your absence here, we all love Peace,
And pray the Fruits thereof, and the Increase;
So doth the King, and most of the Kings-men
That have good Places: therefore once agen,
Pox on thee Vulcan, thy Pandora's Pox,
And all the Evils that flew out of her Box
Light on thee: Or if those Plagues will not do,
Thy Wives Pox on thee, and Bess Broughton's too.

Would think no more of Vlushing,Flushing or the Brill:

For that unnecessary Charge they were.

Supplant bold Panton; and brought there to view
Translated ��lian Tacticks to be read,
And the Greek Discipline (with the modern) shed
So, in that ground, as soon it grew to be

Were now the greater Captain? for they saw
The Berghen Siege, and taking in Breda,
So acted to the Life, as Maurice might,

Come to their Schools,) show 'em the use of Guns.
And there instruct the noble English Heirs
In Politick, and Militar Affairs;

For Education of our Lordings; Soon
Should he hear of Billow, Wind, and Storm,
From the Tempestuous Grandlings, who'll inform
Us, in our bearing, that are thus, and thus,
Born, bred, allied? what's he dare tutor us?
Are we by Book-worms to be aw'd? must we
Live by their Scale, that dare do nothing free?
Why are we Rich, or Great, except to show
All licence in our Lives? What need we know?
More then to praise a Dog? or Horse? or speak
The Hawking Language? or our Day to break
With Citizens? let Clowns, and Tradesmen breed
Their Sons to study Arts, the Laws, the Creed:
We will believe like Men of our own Rank,
In so much Land a year, or such a Bank,
That turns us so much Monies, at which rate
Our Ancestors impos'd on Prince and State.
Let poor Nobility be vertuous: We,
Descended in a Rope of Titles, be
From Guy, or Bevis, Arthur, or from whom
The Herald will. Our Blood is now become,
Past any need of Vertue. Let them care,
That in the Cradle of their Gentry are;
To serve the State by Councels, and by Arms:
We neither love the Troubles, nor the harms.
What love you then? your Whore? what study? Gate,
Carriage, and Dressing. There is up of late
The Academy, where the Gallants meet
What to make Legs? yes, and to smell most sweet,
All that they do at Plays. O, but first here
They learn and study; and then practise there.
But why are all these Irons i' the Fire
Of several makings? helps, helps, t' attire

This, and that Box his Beauty to repair;
This other for his Eye-brows; hence, away,

These Carkasses of Honour; Taylors blocks,
Cover'd with Tissue, whose prosperity mocks
The fate of things: whilst totter'd Vertue holds
Her broken Arms up, to their empty Moulds.

They cannot last. No Lye grew ever old.
Turn him, and see his Threds: look, if he be
Friend to himself, that would be friend to thee.

With endless Labours, whilst thy Learning draws
No less of Praise, then Readers in all kinds
Of worthiest knowledge, that can take Mens minds.

Then these can ever be; or else wish none.
What is't to me whether the French Design
Be, or be not, to get the Vall-telline?
Or the States Ships sent forth belike to meet
Some hopes of Spain in their West-Indian Fleet?
Whether the Dispensation yet be sent,
Or that the Match from Spain was ever meant?
I wish all well, and pray high Heaven conspire
My Princes safety, and my Kings desire;
But if for Honour, we must draw the Sword,
And force back that, which will not be restor'd,
I have a Body, yet, that Spirit draws
To live, or fall, a Carkass in the Cause.
So far without inquiry what the States,
Brunsfield, and Mansfield do this year, my Fates
Shall carry me at Call; and I'll be well,
Though I do neither hear these news, nor tell
Of Spain or France; or were not prick'd down one
Of the late Mystery of Reception,
Although my Fame, to his, not under-hears,
That guides the Motions, and directs the Bears.
But that's a blow, by which in time I may
Lose all my Credit with my Christmas Clay,
And animated Porc'lane of the Court,
I, and for this neglect, the courser sort
Of earthen Jars, there may molest me too:
Well, with mine own frail Pitcher, what to do
I have decreed; keep it from waves and press;
Lest it be justled, crack'd made nought, or less:
Live to that Point I will, for which I am Man,
And dwell as in my Center, as I can,
Still looking too, and ever loving Heaven;
With reverence using all the Gifts then given.
'Mongst which, if I have any friendships sent
Such as are square, well-tag'd, and permanent,
Not built with Canvass, Paper, and false lights,
As are the Glorious Scenes, at the great sights;
And that there be no fev'ry heats, nor colds,
Oily Expansions, or shrunk dirty Folds,
But all so clear, and led by Reasons Flame,
As but to stumble in her sight were shame.
These I will honour, love, embrace, and serve;
And free it from all question to preserve.
So short you read my Character, and theirs
I would call mine, to which not many Stairs
Are asked to climb. First give me faith, who know
My self a little. I will take you so,
As you have writ your self. Now stand, and then

And the right ways you take unto the right,
To conquer Rumour, and triumph on Spight;
Not only shunning by your act, to do
Ought that is ill, but the suspicion too,

No Friend to Vertue, could be silent here.
The rather when the Vices of the Time
Are grown so Fruitful, and false Pleasures climb
By all oblique Degrees, that killing height
From whence they fall, cast down with their own weight.
And though all Praise bring nothing to your Name,
Who (herein studying Conscience, and not Fame)
Are in your self rewarded; yet 'twill be
A chearful Work to all good Eyes, to see
Among the daily Ruins that fall foul,
Of State, of Fame, of Body, and of Soul,
So great a Vertue stand upright to view,
As makes Penelope's old Fable true,
Whilst your Ulisses hath ta'ne leave to go,
Countries, and climescomma omitted Manners and Men to know.
Only your time you better entertain,
Than the great Homer's Wit, for her, could fain;
For you admit no Company, but good,
And when you want those Friends, or near in Blood,
Or your Allies, you make your Books your Friends,
And study them unto the noblest Ends,
Searching for Knowledge, and to keep your Mind
The same it was inspir'd, rich, and refin'd.
These Graces, when the rest of Ladies view
Not boasted in your Life, but practis'd true,
As they are hard, for them to make their own,
So are they profitable to be known:
For when they find so many meet in one,
It will be shame for them, if they have none.

What, by that Name, we each to other owe,
Freedom and Truth; with love from those begot.
Wise-crafts, on which the Flatterer ventures not.
His is more safe Commodity, or none:
Nor dares he come in the comparison.
But as the wretched Painter, who so ill
Painted a Dog, that now his subtler Skill
Was, t' have a Boy stand with a Club, and fright
All live Dogs from the Lane, and his Shop's sight,
Till he had sold his Piece, drawn so unlike:
So doth the Flatt'rer with fair Cunning strike
At a Friend's Freedom, proves all circling means
To keep him off; and howsoe'er he gleans
Some of his Forms, he lets him not come near
Where he would fix, for the Distinctions fear,
For as at distance, few have Faculty
To judge: So all Men coming near, can spy,
Though now of Flattery, as of Picture are
More subtle Works, and finer Pieces far,
Than knew the former Ages: yet to Life
All is but Web, and Painting; be the strife
Never so great to get them: and the ends,
Rather to boast rich Hangings, than rare Friends.

Ere thou wert half got out,

And mad'st thy Mothers Womb thine Urn.
How summ'd a Circle didst thou leave Mankind
Of deepest Lore, could we the Center find!

RHYME a a *

Did wiser Nature draw thee back,
From out the Horror of that Sack;
Where Shame, Faith, Honour, and regard of Right
Lay trampled on; the Deeds of Death, and Night,
Urg'd, hurried forth, and horl'd
Upon th' affrighted World:
Sword, Fire, and Famine, with fell Fury met;
And all on utmost Ruin set:
As, could they but Lifes Miseries fore-see,
No doubt all Infants would return like thee?

And told forth fourscore years:
He vexed time, and busied the whole State;
Troubled both Foes and Friends;
But ever to no ends:
What did this Stirrer, but die late?
How well at Twenty had he faln, or stood!
For three of his fourscore, he did no good.

He entred well by Vertuous Parts,
Got up and thriv'd with Honest Arts:
He purchas'd Friends, and Fame, and Honours then,
And had his noble Name advanc'd with Men:
But weary of that flight,
He stoop'd in all Mens sight
To sordid flatteries, acts of Strife,
And sunk in that dead Sea of Life
So deep, as he did then Death's Waters sup:
But that the Cork of Title buoy'd him up.

In weight, in measure, number, sound,

Go now, and tell our Days summ'd up with Fears,
And make them Years:

To shew thou hast been long
Not liv'd; for Life doth her great actions spell,
By what was done and wrought
In season, and so brought
To light: her measures are, how well
Each Syllable answer'd, and was form'd; how fair
These make the Lines of Life, and that's her air.

Although it fall, and die that Night;

And there he lives with Memory; and Ben.

No Pleasures vain did chime,
Of Rhymes, or Riots, at your Feasts,
Orgies of Drink, or feign'd Protests:
But simple love of Greatness, and of Good;
That knits brave Minds, and Manners, more than Blood.

Where they might read, and find
Friendship, indeed, was written, not in words:
And with the Heart, not Pen,
Of Two so early Men,
Whose Lines her Rolls were, and Records.
Who, ere the first down-bloomed on the Chin,
Had sow'd these Fruits, and got the Harvest in.

And set the Mark upon,
To give a greater Name, and Title to! their own!

Weston, their Treasure, as their Treasurer,
That Mine of Wisdom, and of Counsels deep,
Great Say-Master of State, who cannot err,
But doth his Carract, and just Standard keep
In all the prov'd assays,
And legal ways
Of Tryals, to work down
Mens Loves unto the Laws, and Laws to love the Crown.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

And this well mov'd the Judgment of the King
To pay with Honours, to his noble Son
To day, the Father's Service; who could bring
Him up, to do the same himself had done:
That far-all-seeing Eye
Could soon espy
What kind of waking Man
He had so highly set; and in what Barbican.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Stand there; for when a noble Nature's rais'd,
It brings Friends Joy, Foes Grief, Posterity Fame;
In him the times, no less than Prince, are prais'd,
And by his Rise, in active Men, his Name
Doth Emulation stir;
To th' dull, a Spur
It is: to th' envious meant,
A meer upbraiding Grief, and tort'ring punishment.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

See now the Chapel opens; where the King
And Bishop stay, to consummate the Rites:
The holy Prelate prays, then takes the Ring,
Asks first, Who gives her (I Charles); then he plights
One in the others Hand,
Whilst they both stand
Hearing their Charge, and then
The solemn Quire cries, Joy; and they return, Amen.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

O happy Bands! and thou more happy place,
Which to this use, wer't built and consecrate!
To have thy God to bless, thy King to grace,
And this their chosen Bishop celebrate;
And knit the Nuptial Knot,
Which Time shall not,
Or canker'd Jealousie,
With all corroding arts, be able to untie!

The Chapel empties, and thou may'st be gone
Now, Sun, and post away the rest of day:
These two, now Holy Church hath made them one,
Do long to make themselves so, another way:
There is a Feast behind,
To them of kind,
Which their glad Parents taught
One to the other, long ere these to light were brought.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Haste, haste, officious Sun, and send them Night
Some Hours before it should, that these may know
All that their Fathers, and their Mothers might
Of Nuptial Sweets, at such a Season, owe,
To propagate their Names,
And keep their Fames
Alive, which else would die;
For Fame keeps Vertue up, and it Posterity.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Th' Ignoble never liv'd, they were a-while
Like Swine, or other Cattel here on Earth:
Their Names are not recorded on the File
Of Life, that fall so; Christians know their Birth
Alone, and such a Race,
We pray may grace,
Your fruitful spreading Vine,
But dare not ask our Wish in Language fescennine:

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Yet, as we may, we will, with chaste desires,
(The Holy Perfumes of the Marriage-Bed)
Be kept alive, those Sweet and Sacred Fires
Of Love between you, and your Lovely-head:
That when you both are old,
You find no cold
There; but renewed, say,
(After the last Child born:) This is our Wedding-day.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

Till you behold a Race to fill your Hall,
A Richard, and a Hierome, by their Names
Upon a Thomas, or a Francis call;
A Kate, a Frank, to honor their Grand-dames,
And 'tween their Grandsires thighs,
Like pretty Spies,
Peep forth a Gem; to see
How each one plays his part, of the large Pedigree.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

And never may there want one of the Stem,
To be a watchful Servant for this State;
But like an Arm of Eminence 'mongst them,
Extend a reaching Vertue, early and late:
Whilst the main Tree still found
Upright and sound,
By this Sun's Noonsted's made
So great; his Body now alone projects the shade.

RHYME a b a b c c d d

They both are slipp'd to Bed; shut fast the Door,
And let him freely gather Loves First-Fruits,
He's Master of the Office; yet no more
Exacts than she is pleas'd to pay: no Suits,
Strifes, Murmurs, or Delay,
Will last till Day:
Night, and the Sheets will show,
The longing Couple, all that Elder Lovers know.

Of his special Grace to Letters,
To make all the M U S E S Debtors
To his Bounty, by Extension
Of a free Poetick Pension,
A large Hundred Marks Annuity,
To be given me in Gratuity
For done Service, and to come:
And that this so accepted Sum,
Or dispens'd in Books, or Bread,
(For with both the M U S E was fed)
Hath drawn on me, from the times,
All the Envy of the Rhymes,
And the ratling Pit-pat-noise
Of the less Poetick Boys,
When their Pot-Guns aim to hit,
With their Pellets of small Wit,
Parts of me (they judg'd) decay'd,
But we last out, still unlay'd.
Please your Majesty to make
Of your Grace, for Goodness sake,
Those your Fathers Marks, your Pounds;

IF to my Mind, great Lord, I had a State,
I would present you now with curious Plate
Of Noremberg, or Turky: Hang your Rooms
Not with the Arras, but the Persian Looms:
I would, if Price, or Prayer could them get,
Send in, what or Romano, Tintaret,
Titian, or Raphael, Michael Angelo
Have left in Fame to equal, or out-go
The Old Greek Hands in Picture, or in Stone.
This I would do, could I know Weston, one
Catch'd with these Arts, wherein the Judge is wise,
As far as Sense, and only by the Eyes.
But you, I know, my Lord; and know you can
Discern between a Statue and a Man:
Can do the things that Statues do deserve,
And act the business, which they paint, or carve.
What you have studied, are the arts of Life;
To compose Men, and Manners; stint the strife
Of murmuring Subjects; make the Nations know
What Worlds of Blessings to good Kings they owe:
And mightiest Monarchs feel what large increase
Of Sweets, and Safeties, they possess by Peace.
These I look up at with a reverend Eye,
And strike Religion in the standers-by:
Which though I cannot, as an Architect,
In glorious Piles, or Pyramids erect
Unto your Honour: I can tune in Song
Aloud: and (happ'ly) it may last as long.

THo', happy Muse, thou know my Digby well,
Yet read him in these lines: He doth excel
In Honour, Courtesie, and all the parts
Court can call hers, or Man could call his Arts.
He's Prudent, Valiant, Just, and Temperate
In him all Vertue is beheld in State:
And he is built like some Imperial Room
For that to dwell in, and be still at home.
His Breast is a brave Palace, a broad Street,
Where all Heroick ample Thoughts do meet:
Where Nature such a large Survey hath ta'en,
As other Souls, to his, dwelt in a Lane:
Witness his Action done at Scanderone;
Upon my Birth-day, the Eleventh of June;
When the Apostle Barnaby the Bright
Unto our year doth give the longest light,
In sign the Subject, and the Song will live,
Which I have vow'd Posterity to give.
Go, Muse, in, and salute him. Say he be
Busie, or frown at first; when he sees thee,
He will clear up his Forehead: think thou bringst
Good Omen to him, in the Note thou sing'st:
For he doth love my Verses, and will look
Upon them, (next to Spencer's noble Book)
And praise them too. O! what a Fame 't will be?
What Reputation to my Lines, and me,
When he shall read them at the Treasurer's Board?
The knowing Weston, and that Learned Lord
Allows them? Then, what Copies shall be had,
What Transcripts begg'd? how cry'd up, and how glad,
Wilt thou be, Muse, when this shall them befall?
Being sent to one, they will be read of all.

Grow up, sweet Babe, as blessed, in thy Name,

WHat gentle Ghost, besprent with April Dew,
Hails me, so solemnly, to yonder Yew?
And beck'ning wooes me, from the fatal Tree
To pluck a Garland, for her self or me?
I do obey you, Beauty! for in death,
You seem a fair one! O that you had breath,
To give your shade a name! Stay, stay, I feel
A horror in me! all my Blood is Steel!
Stiff! stark! my Joints 'gainst one another knock!
Whose Daughter? ha? Great Savage of the Rock?
He's good, as great. I am almost a Stone!
And e'er I can ask more of her she's gone!
Alas, I am all Marble! write the rest
Thou wouldst have written, Fame, upon my Breast:
It is a large fair Table, and a true,
And the disposure will be something new,
When I, who would the Poet have become,
At least may bear th' Inscription to her Tomb.
She was the Lady Jane, and Marchioness
Of Winchester; the Heralds can tell this.
Earl River's Grand-Child serve not forms, good Fame,
Sound thou her Vertues, give her Soul a Name,
Had I a thousand Mouths, as many Tongues,
And Voice to raise them from my brazen Lungs,
I durst not aim at that: The dotes were such
Thereof, no notion can express how much
Their Carract was! I, or my Trump must break,
But rather I, should I of that part speak!
It is too near of kin to Heaven, the Soul,
To be describ'd! Fames Fingers are too foul
To touch these Mysteries! We may admire
The blaze, and splendor, but not handle fire!
What she did here, by great example, well,
T' inlive Posterity, her Fame may tell!
And, calling truth to witness, make that good
From the inherent Graces in her Blood!
Else, who doth praise a Person by a new,
But a fain'd way, doth rob it of the true.
Her Sweetness, Softness, her fair Courtesie,
Her wary Guards, her wise Simplicity,
Were like a Ring of Vertues, 'bout her set,
And Piety the Center, where all met.
A reverend State she had, an awful Eye;
A dazling, yet inviting Majesty:

RHYME a a *

What Nature, Fortune, Institution, Fact
Could summ to a perfection, was her Act!
How did she leave the World? with what contempt?
Just as she in it liv'd! and so exempt
From all affection! when they urg'd the Cure
Of her Disease, how did her Soul assure
Her suff'rings, as the Body had been away!
And to the Torturers (her Doctors) say,
Stick on your Cupping-glasses, fear not, put
Your hottest Causticks to, burn, lance, or cut:
'Tis but a Body which you can torment,
And I, into the World, all Soul was sent!
Then comforted her Lord! and blest her Son!
Chear'd her fair Sisters in her Race to run!
With gladness temper'd her sad Parents Tears!
Made her Friends Joys, to get above their Fears!
And, in her last act, taught the Standers-by,
With admiration, and applause to die!
Let Angels sing her glories, who did call
Her Spirit home, to her Original!
Who saw the way was made it! and were sent
To carry, and conduct the Complement
'Twixt death and life! Where her Mortality
Became her Birth-day to Eternity!
And now, through circumfused light, she looks
On Natures Secrets, there, as her own Books:
Speaks Heavens Language! and discovereth free
To every Order, ev'ry Hierarchy!
Beholds her Maker! and, in him, doth see
What the beginnings of all Beauties be;
And all Beatitudes, that thence do flow:
Which they that have the Crown are sure to know!
Go now, her happy Parents, and be sad,
If you not understand, what Child you had.
If you dare grudge at Heaven, and repent
T' have paid again a Blessing was but lent,
And trusted so, as it deposited lay
At pleasure, to be call'd for, every day!
If you can envy your own Daughters bliss,
And wish her state less happy than it is!
If you can cast about your either Eye,
And see all dead here, or about to die!
The Stars, that are the Jewels of the Night,
And Day, deceasing! with the Prince of Light,
The Sun! great Kings! and mightiest Kingdoms fall!
Whole Nations! nay Mankind! the World, with all
That ever had beginning there, to 'ave end!
With what injustice should one Soul pretend
T' escape this common known necessity,
When we were all born, we began to die;
And, but for that contention, and brave strife,
The Christian hath t' enjoy the future life,
He were the wretched'st of the Race of Men:
But as he soars at that, he bruiseth then
The Serpents Head: Gets above Death, and Sin,
And, sure of Heaven, rides triumphing in.

BOast not these Titles of your Ancestors;
(Brave Youths) th' are their possessions, none of yours:
When your own Vertues, equall'd have their Names,
'Twill be but fair, to lean upon their Fames;
For they are strong Supporters: But, till then,
The greatest are but growing Gentlemen.
It is a wretched thing to trust to Reeds;
Which all Men do, that urge not their own deeds
Up to their Ancestors; the Rivers side,
By which yo' are planted, shew's your Fruit shall bide:
Hang all your Rooms, with one large Pedigree:
'Tis Vertue alone, is true Nobility.
Which Vertue from your Father, ripe, will fall;
Study illustrious Him, and you have all.

TWere time that I dy'd too, now she is dead,
Who was my Muse, and life of all I did.
The Spirit that I wrote with, and conceiv'd,
All that was good, or great in me she weav'd,
And set it forth; the rest were Cobwebs fine,
Spun out in name of some of the old Nine!
To hang a Window, or make dark the Room,
Till swept away, th' were cancell'd with a Broom!
Nothing, that could remain, or yet can stir
A sorrow in me, fit to wait to her!
O! had I seen her laid out a fair Course,
By Death, on Earth, I should have had remorse
On Nature, for her: who did let her lie,
And saw that portion of her self to die.
Sleepy, or stupid Nature, couldst thou part
With such a Rarity, and not rouse Art
With all her aids, to save her from the seize
Of Vulture Death, and those relentless Cleys?
Thou wouldst have lost the Ph���nix, had the kind
Been trusted to thee: not to 't self assign'd.

Look on thy sloth, and give thy self undone,
(For so thou art with me) now she is gone,
My wounded mind cannot sustain this stroke,
It rages, runs, flies, stands, and would provoke
The World to ruine with it; in her Fall,
I summ up mine own breaking, and wish all.
Thou hast no more blows, Fate, to drive at one,
What's left a Poet, when his Muse is gone?
Sure, I am dead, and know it not! I feel
Nothing I do; but, like a heavy Wheel,
Am turned with anothers powers. My Passion
Whirls me about, and to blaspheme in fashion!
I murmur against God, for having ta'en
Her blessed Soul, hence, forth this Valley vane
Of Tears, and Dungeon of Calamity!
I envy it the Angels amity!
The joy of Saints! the Crown for which it lives,
The glory, and gain of rest, which the place gives!
Dare I prophane, so irreligious be
To 'greet, or grieve her soft Euthanasee!
So sweetly taken to the Court of bliss,
As Spirits had stol'n her Spirit, in a kiss,
From off her Pillow, and deluded Bed;
And left her lovely Body unthought dead!
Indeed, she is not dead! but laid to sleep
In Earth, till the last Trump awake the Sheep
And Goats together, whither they must come
To hear their Judge, and his eternal doom.
To have that final retribution,
Expected with the Fleshes restitution.
For, as there are three Natures, Schoolmen call
One Corporal, only; th' other Spiritual,
Like single; so, there is a third, commixt,
Of Body and Spirit together, plac'd betwixt
Those other two; which must be judg'd, or crown'd:
This as it guilty is, or guiltless found,
Must come to take a sentence, by the sense
Of that great Evidence, the Conscience!
Who will be there, against that day prepar'd,
T' accuse, or quit all Parties to be heard!
O Day of joy, and surety to the just!
Who in that Feast of Resurrection trust!
That great eternal Holy-day of rest,
To Body, and Soul! where Love is all the guest!
And the whole Banquet is full fight'sight' of God!
Of joy the Circle, and sole Period!
All other gladness, with the thought is barr'd;
Hope, hath her end! and Faith hath her reward!
This being thus: why should my Tongue, or Pen
Presume to interpel that fulness, when
Nothing can more adorn it, than the Seat
That she is in, or, make it more compleat?
Better be dumb, than superstitious!
Who violates the God-head, is most vicious
Against the Nature he would worship. He
Will honour'd be in all simplicity!
Have all his actions, wondred at, and view'd
With silence, and amazement! not with rude,
Dull, and prophane, weak, and imperfect Eyes,
Have busie search made in his mysteries!
He knows, what work h' hath done, to call this Guest,
Out of her noble Body, to this Feast:
And give her place, according to her Blood
Amongst her Peers, those Princes of all good!
Saints, Martyrs, Prophets, with those Hierarchies,
Angels, Arch-angels, Principalities,
The Dominations, Vertues, and the Powers,
The Thrones, the Cherub, and Seraphick Bowers,
That, planted round, there sing before the Lamb,
A new Song to his praise, and great I Am:
And she doth know, out of the shade of Death,
What 't is t' enjoy, an everlasting Breath!
To have her captiv'd Spirit freed from Flesh,
And on her Innocence, a Garment fresh

RHYME a a *

And white, as that: put on and in her hand
With Boughs of Palm, a crowned Victrice stand!
And will you, worthy Son, Sir, knowing this,
Put Black, and Mourning on? and say you miss
A Wife, a Friend, a Lady, or a Love;
Whom her Redeemer, honour'd hath above
Her Fellows, with the Oyl of Gladness, bright
In HeavenHeaven's Empire, and with a Robe of Light?
Thither, you hope to come; and there to find
That pure, that pretious, and exalted Mind
You once enjoy'd: A short space severs yee,
Compar'd unto that long Eternity,
That shall re-joyn ye. Was she, then, so dear,
When she departed? you will meet her there,
Much more desir'd, and dearer then before,
By all the Wealth of Blessings, and the store
Accumulated on her, by the Lord
Of Life, and Light, the Son of God, the Word!
There, all the happy Souls, that ever were,
Shall meet with gladness in one Theatre;
And each shall know, there, one anothers Face:
By beatifick Vertue of the Place.
There shall the Brother, with the Sister walk,
And Sons, and Daughters, with their Parents talk;
But all of God; They still shall have to say,
But make him All in All, their Theme, that Day:
That happy Day, that never shall see night!
Where He will be, all Beauty to the Sight;
Wine, or delicious Fruits, unto the Taste;
A Musick in the Ears, will ever last;
Unto the Scent, a Spicery, or Balm;
And to the Touch, a Flower, like soft as Palm.
He will all Glory, all Perfection be,
God, in the Union, and the Trinity!
That Holy, Great, and Glorious Mystery,
Will there revealed be in Majesty!
By light, and comfort of Spiritual Grace;
The Vision of our Saviour, Face to Face
In his Humanity! To hear him preach
The price of our Redemption, and to teach
Through his inherent Righteousness, in death,
The safety of our Souls, and forfeit Breath!
What fulness of Beatitude is here?
What Love with Mercy mixed doth appear?
To stile us Friends, who were, by Nature, Foes?
Adopt us Heirs, by Grace, who were of those
Had lost our selves? and prodigally spent
Our native Portions, and possessed Rent;
Yet have all Debts forgiven us, and advance
B' imputed right to an Inheritance
In his Eternal Kingdom, where we sit
Equal with Angels, and Co-heirs of it.
Nor dare we under Blasphemy conceive
He that shall be our Supreme Judge, should leave
Himself so un-inform'd of his Elect,
Who knows the Hearts of all, and can dissect
The smallest Fibre of our Flesh; he can
Find all our Atoms from a Point t' a Span!
Our closest Creeks, and Corners, and can trace
Each Line, as it were graphick, in the Face.
And best he knew her noble Character,
For 'twas himself who form'd, and gave it her.
And to that Form, lent two such Veins of Blood
As Nature could not more increase the Flood
Of Title in her! All Nobility
(But Pride, that Schism of incivility)
She had, and it became her! she was fit
T' have known no Envy, but by fuffring'suffring' it!
She had a Mind as calm, as she was fair;
Not tost or troubled with light Lady-air;
But, kept an even Gate, as some streight Tree
Mov'd by the Wind, so comely moved she.
And by the awful manage of her Eye
She swaid all Bus'ness in the Family!

RHYME a a *

To one she said, Do this, he did it; So
To another, Move; he went; To a third, Go,
He run; and all did strive with diligence
T' obey, and serve her sweet Commandments.
She was in one, a many parts of Life;
A tender Mother, a discreeter Wife,
A solemn Mistress, and so good a Friend,
So Charitable, to religious End
In all her petite Actions, so devote,
As her whole Life was now become one Note
Of Piety, and private Holiness.
She spent more time in Tears her self to dress
For her Devotions, and those sad Essays
Of Sorrow, then all pomp of gaudy days:
And came forth ever cheered, with the Rod
Of divine Comfort, when sh' had talk'd with God.
Her broken Sighs did never miss whole Sense:
Nor can the bruised Heart want Eloquence:
For, Prayer is the Incense most perfumes
The Holy Altars, when it least presumes.
And hers were all Humility! they beat
The Door of Grace, and found the Mercy-Seat.
In frequent speaking by the pious Psalms
Her solemn hours she spent, or giving Alms,
Or doing other Deeds of Charity,
To clothe the Naked, feed the Hungry. She
Would sit in an Infirmer,'Infirmary' whole days
Poring, as on a Map, to find the Ways
To that eternal Rest, where now sh' hath Place
By sure Election, and predestin'd Grace!
She saw her Saviour, by an early light,
Incarnate in the Manger, shining bright
On all the World! She saw him on the Cross
Suffring, and dying to redeem our loss:
She saw him rise, triumphing over Death
To justifie, and quicken us in Breath!
She saw him too, in Glory to ascend
For his designed work the perfect end
Of raising, judging, and rewarding all
The kind of Man, on whom his Doom should fall!
All this by Faith she saw, and fram'd a Plea,
In manner of a daily Apostrophe,
To him should be her Judge, true God, true Man,
Jesus, the only gotten Christ! who can
As being Redeemer, and Repairer too
(Of lapsed Nature) best know what to do,
In that great Act of Judgment: Which the Father
Hath given wholly to the Son (the rather
As being the Son of Man) to shew his Power,
His Wisdom, and his Justice, in that hour,
The last of hours, and shutter up of all;
Where first his Power will appear, by call
Of all are dead to Life! His Wisdom show
In the discerning of each Conscience, so!
And most his Justice, in the fitting Parts,
And giving dues to all Mankinds Deserts!
In this sweet Extasie, she was rapt hence.
Who reads, will pardon my Intelligence,
That thus have ventur'd these true Strains upon;
To publish her a Saint. My Muse is gone.

HAppy is he, that from all Business clear,
As the old Race of Mankind were,
With his own Oxen tills his Sires left Lands,
And is not in the Usurers Bands:
Nor Soldier-like started with rough Alarms,
Nor dreads the Seas inraged harms:
But flees the Bar and Courts, with the proud bords,
And waiting Chambers of great Lords.
The Poplar tall, he then doth marrying twine
With the grown issue of the Vine;
And with his Hook lops off the fruitless Race,
And sets more happy in the Place:
Or in the bending Vale beholds a-far
The lowing Herds there grazing are:
Or the prest Honey in pure Pots doth keep
Of Earth, and shears the tender Sheep:
Or when that Autumn, through the Fields lifts round
His Head, with mellow Apples crown'd,
How plucking Pears, his own hand grafted had,
And Purple-matching Grapes, he's glad!
With which, Priapus, he may thank thy Hands,
And, Sylvane, thine that keptst his Lands!
Then now beneath some ancient Oak he may
Now in the rooted Grass him lay,
Whilst from the higher Banks do slide the Floods?
The soft Birds quarrel in the Woods,
The Fountains murmur as the Streams do creep,
And all invite to easie sleep.
Then when the thundring Jove, his Snow and Showers
Are gathering by the Wintry hours;
Or hence, or thence, he drives with many a Hound
Wild Boars into his Toils pitch'd round:
Or strains on his small Fork his subtil Nets
For th' eating Thrush, or Pit-falls sets:
And snares the fearful Hare, and new-come Crane,
And 'counts them sweet Rewards so ta'en.
Who (amongst these delights) would not forget
Loves cares so Evil, and so great?
But if, to boot with these, a chaste Wife meet
For Houshold aid, and Children sweet;
Such as the Sabines, or a Sun-burnt-blowse,
Some lusty quick Apulians Spouse,
To deck the hallow'd Harth with old Wood fir'd
Against the Husband comes home tir'd;
That penning the glad flock in Hurdles by
Their swelling Udders doth draw dry:
And from the sweet Tub Wine of this year takes,
And unbought Viands ready makes:
Not Lucrine Oysters I could then more prize,
Nor Turbot, nor bright Golden Eyes:
If with bright Floods, the Winter troubled much,
Into our Seas send any such:
Th' Ionian God-wit, nor the Ginny-hen
Could not go down my Belly then
More sweet than Olives, that new gather'd be
From fattest Branches of the Tree:
Or the Herb Sorrel, that loves Meadows still,
Or Mallows loosing Bodies ill:
Or at the Feast of Bounds, the Lamb then slain,
Or Kid forc't from the Wolf again.
Among these Cates how glad the sight doth come
Of the fed Flocks approaching home!
To view the weary Oxen draw, with bare
And fainting Necks, the turned Share!
The wealthy Houshold swarm of Bondmen met,
And 'bout the steeming Chimney set!
These thoughts when Usurer Alphius, now about
To turn more Farmer, had spoke out
'Gainst th' Ides, his Moneys he gets in with pain,
At th' Calends puts all out again.

Too stubborn for Commands, so slack:

And for the troubled Client fill's'files' his Tongue,

Will he display the Ensigns of thy War.
And when he smiling finds his Grace
With thee 'bove all his Rivals Gifts take place,
He will thee a Marble Statue make
Beneath a Sweet, wood Roof, neer Alba Lake:
There shall thy dainty Nostril take
In many a Gum, and for thy soft Ears sake
Shall Verse be set to Harp and Lute,
And Phrygian Hau'boy, not without the Flute.
There twice a day in sacred Lays,
The Youths and tender Maids shall sing thy praise:
And in the Salian manner meet
Thrice 'bout thy Altar with their Ivory Feet,

Delights, nor credulous hope of mutual Joy,
Nor care I now Healths to propound;
Or with fresh Flowers to girt my Temple round.

Flow my thin Tears, down these pale Cheeks of mine?
Or why, my well-grac'd words among,
With an uncomely silence fails my Tongue?

For Lust will languish, and that Heat decay,
But thus, thus, keeping endless Holy-day,
Let us together closely lie, and kiss,

And heat, with softest Love, thy softer Bed.

  The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,
The Burman give us Irriwaddy chills,
  An' a Zulu ~impi~ dished us up in style:
But all we ever got from such as they
  Was pop to what the Fuzzy made us swaller;
We held our bloomin' own, the papers say,
  But man for man the Fuzzy knocked us holler.
    Then here's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' the missis and the kid;
    Our orders was to break you, an' of course we went an' did.
    We sloshed you with Martinis, an' it wasn't hardly fair;
    But for all the odds agin' you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square.

HE hasn't got no papers of his own,
  HE hasn't got no medals nor rewards,
So we must certify the skill he's shown
  In usin' of his long two-handed swords:
When he's hoppin' in an' out among the bush
  With his coffin-headed shield an' shovel-spear,
An happy day with Fuzzy on the rush
  Will last an healthy Tommy for a year.
    So here's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, an' your friends which are no more,
    If we hadn't lost some messmates we would help you to deplore;
    But give an' take's the gospel, an' we'll call the bargain fair,
    For if you have lost more than us, you crumpled up the square!
 
RHYME a b a b c d c d e e f f  
 
HE rushes at the smoke when we let drive,
  An', before we know, he's hackin' at our head;
HE's all hot sand an' ginger when alive,
  An' he's generally shammin' when he's dead.
HE's a daisy, he's a ducky, he's a lamb!
  HE's a injia-rubber idiot on the spree,
HE's the on'y thing that doesn't give a damn
  For a Regiment o' British Infantree!
    So here's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, at your home in the Soudan;
    You're a pore benighted heathen but a first-class fightin' man;
    An' here's ~to~ you, Fuzzy-Wuzzy, with your hayrick head of hair --
    You big black boundin' beggar -- for you broke a British square!

You may talk o' gin and beer
When you're quartered safe out here,
An' you're sent to penny-fights an' Aldershot it;
But when it comes to slaughter
You will do your work on water,
An' you'll lick the bloomin' boots of him that's got it.
Now in Injia's sunny clime,
Where I used to spend my time
A-servin' of HEr Majesty the Queen,
Of all them blackfaced crew
The finest man I knew
Was our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din.

Wot makes the soldier's heart to penk, wot makes him to perspire?
It isn't standin' up to charge nor lyin' down to fire;
But it's everlastin' waitin' on a everlastin' road
For the commissariat camel an' his commissariat load.
    O the oont*, O the oont, O the commissariat oont!
     With his silly neck a-bobbin' like a basket full o' snakes;
    We packs him like an idol, an' you ought to hear him grunt,
     An' when we gets him loaded up his blessed girth-rope breaks.
 
RHYME a a b b c d c d  
 
Wot makes the rear-guard swear so hard when night is drorin' in,
An' every native follower is shiverin' for his skin?
It ain't the chanst o' being rushed by Paythans from the hills,
It's the commissariat camel puttin' on his bloomin' frills!
    O the oont, O the oont, O the hairy scary oont!
     A-trippin' over tent-ropes when we've got the night alarm!
    We socks him with a stretcher-pole an' heads him off in front,
     An' when we've saved his bloomin' life he chaws our bloomin' arm.
 
RHYME a a b b c d c d  
 
The horse he knows above a bit, the bullock's but a fool,
The elephant's a gentleman, the battery-mule's a mule;
But the commissariat cam-u-el, when all is said an' done,
HE's a devil an' a ostrich an' a orphan-child in one.
    O the oont, O the oont, O the Gawd-forsaken oont!
     The lumpy-humpy hummin'-bird a-singin' where he lies,
    HE's blocked the whole division from the rear-guard to the front,
     An' when we get him up again -- the beggar goes an' dies!
 
RHYME a a b b c d c d  
 
HE'll gall an' chafe an' lame an' fight -- he smells most awful vile;
HE'll lose hisself for ever if you let him stray a mile;
HE's game to graze the hole day long an' howl the hole night through,
An' when he comes to greasy ground he splits hisself in two.
    O the oont, O the oont, O the floppin', droppin' oont!
     When his long legs give from under an' his meltin' eye is dim,
    The tribes is up behind us, and the tribes is out in front --
     It ain't no jam for Tommy, but it's kites an' crows for him.
 
RHYME a a b b c d c d  
 
So when the cruel march is done, an' when the roads is blind,
An' when we sees the camp in front an' hears the shots behind,
Ho! then we strips his saddle off, and all his woes is past:
HE thinks on us that used him so, and gets revenge at last.
    O the oont, O the oont, O the floatin', bloatin' oont!
     The late lamented camel in the water-cut he lies;
    We keeps a mile behind him an' we keeps a mile in front,
     But he gets into the drinkin'-casks, and then o' course we dies.

This happened in a battle to a batt'ry of the corps
Which is first among the women an' amazin' first in war;
An' what the bloomin' battle was I don't remember now,
But Two's off-lead he answered to the name o' ~Snarleyow~.

They was movin' into action, they was needed very sore,
To learn a little schoolin' to a native army corps,
They had nipped against an uphill, they was tuckin' down the brow,
When a tricky, trundlin' roundshot give the knock to ~Snarleyow~.
 
RHYME a a *

They cut him loose an' left him -- he was almost tore in two --
But he tried to follow after as a well-trained horse should do;
HE went an' fouled the limber, an' the Driver's Brother squeals:
"Pull up, pull up for ~Snarleyow~ -- his head's between his heels!"
 
RHYME a a *

The Driver humped his shoulder, for the wheels was goin' round,
An' there ain't no "Stop, conductor!" when a batt'ry's changin' ground;
Sez he:  "I broke the beggar in, an' very sad I feels,
But I couldn't pull up, not for ~you~ -- your head between your heels!"

HE hadn't hardly spoke the word, before a droppin' shell
A little right the batt'ry an' between the sections fell;
An' when the smoke had cleared away, before the limber wheels,
There lay the Driver's Brother with his head between his heels.
 
RHYME a a *

Then sez the Driver's Brother, an' his words was very plain,
"For Gawd's own sake get over me, an' put me out o' pain."
They saw his wounds was mortial, an' they judged that it was best,
So they took an' drove the limber straight across his back an' chest.
 
RHYME a a *

The Driver he give nothin' 'cept a little coughin' grunt,
But he swung his horses handsome when it came to "Action Front!"
An' if one wheel was juicy, you may lay your Monday head
'Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread.

The moril of this story, it is plainly to be seen:
You havn't got no families when servin' of the Queen --
You havn't got no brothers, fathers, sisters, wives, or sons --
If you want to win your battles take an' work your bloomin' guns!
    Down in the Infantry, nobody cares;

There was a row in Silver Street that's near to Dublin Quay,
Between an Irish regiment an' English cavalree;

The first man dropped at Harrison's, the last forninst the Park.

There was a row in Silver Street -- the regiments was out,
They called us "Delhi Rebels", an' we answered "Threes about!"

There was a row in Silver Street -- they sent the Polis there,

There was a row in Silver Street -- it might ha' raged till now,
But some one drew his side-arm clear, an' nobody knew how;
'Twas Hogan took the point an' dropped; we saw the red blood run:
An' so we all was murderers that started out in fun.

There was a row in Silver Street -- but that put down the shine,
Wid each man whisperin' to his next:  "'Twas never work o' mine!"
We went away like beaten dogs, an' down the street we bore him,
The poor dumb corpse that couldn't tell the bhoys were sorry for him.

There was a row in Silver Street -- it isn't over yet,

To the legion of the lost ones, to the cohort of the damned,
 To my brethren in their sorrow overseas,
Sings a gentleman of England cleanly bred, machinely crammed,
 And a trooper of the Empress, if you please.
Yea, a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses,
 And faith he went the pace and went it blind,
And the world was more than kin while he held the ready tin,
 But to-day the Sergeant's something less than kind.
   
RHYME a b a b c d e d 
 
Oh, it's sweet to sweat through stables, sweet to empty kitchen slops,
 And it's sweet to hear the tales the troopers tell,
To dance with blowzy housemaids at the regimental hops
 And thrash the cad who says you waltz too well.
Yes, it makes you cock-a-hoop to be "Rider" to your troop,
 And branded with a blasted worsted spur,
When you envy, O how keenly, one poor Tommy being cleanly
 Who blacks your boots and sometimes calls you "Sir".
 
RHYME a b a b c d e d 
 
If the home we never write to, and the oaths we never keep,
 And all we know most distant and most dear,
Across the snoring barrack-room return to break our sleep,
 Can you blame us if we soak ourselves in beer?
When the drunken comrade mutters and the great guard-lantern gutters
 And the horror of our fall is written plain,
Every secret, self-revealing on the aching white-washed ceiling,
 Do you wonder that we drug ourselves from pain?
 
RHYME a b a b c d e d 
 
We have done with Hope and Honour, we are lost to Love and Truth,
 We are dropping down the ladder rung by rung,
And the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth.
 God help us, for we knew the worst too young!
Our shame is clean repentance for the crime that brought the sentence,
 Our pride it is to know no spur of pride,
And the Curse of Reuben holds us till an alien turf enfolds us
 And we die, and none can tell Them where we died.

TITLE The Ballad of East and West

RHYME a a *
 
OH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,	
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God�s great Judgment Seat;	
But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,	
When two strong men stand face to face, tho� they come from the ends of the earth!	

RHYME a a *
 
Kamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border-side,
And he has lifted the Colonel's mare that is the Colonel's pride:
He has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,
And turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.
Then up and spoke the Colonel's son that led a troop of the Guides:
"Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?"
Then up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar:
"If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.
At dusk he harries the Abazai -- at dawn he is into Bonair,
But he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,
So if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,
By the favour of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai.
But if he be past the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,
For the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal's men.
There is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
And ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen."
The Colonel's son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,
With the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell  and the head of the gallows-tree.

RHYME a a *
 
The Colonel's son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat --
Who rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.
He's up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,
Till he was aware of his father's mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,
Till he was aware of his father's mare with Kamal upon her back,
And when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.
He has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.
"Ye shoot like a soldier," Kamal said.  "Show now if ye can ride."
It's up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dustdevils go,
The dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.
The dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,
But the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a glove.
There was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn between,
And thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho' never a man was seen.
They have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,
The dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.
The dun he fell at a water-course -- in a woful heap fell he,
And Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.

RHYME a a *
 
He has knocked the pistol out of his hand -- small room was there to strive,
"'Twas only by favour of mine," quoth he, "ye rode so long alive:
There was not a rock for twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,
But covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.
If I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,
The little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row:
If I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,
The kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly."
Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  "Do good to bird and beast,
But count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.
If there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,
Belike the price of a jackal's meal were more than a thief could pay.
They will feed their horse on the standing crop,  their men on the garnered grain,
The thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain.
But if thou thinkest the price be fair, -- thy brethren wait to sup,
The hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, -- howl, dog, and call them up!
And if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,
Give me my father's mare again, and I'll fight my own way back!"
Kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.
"No talk shall be of dogs," said he, "when wolf and gray wolf meet.
May I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;
What dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?"
Lightly answered the Colonel's son:  "I hold by the blood of my clan:
Take up the mare for my father's gift -- by God, she has carried a man!"
The red mare ran to the Colonel's son, and nuzzled against his breast;
"We be two strong men," said Kamal then, "but she loveth the younger best.
So she shall go with a lifter's dower, my turquoise-studded rein,
My broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain."

RHYME a a *
 
The Colonel's son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,
"Ye have taken the one from a foe," said he;  "will ye take the mate from a friend?"
"A gift for a gift," said Kamal straight; "a limb for the risk of a limb.
Thy father has sent his son to me, I'll send my son to him!"
With that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest --
He trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.
"Now here is thy master," Kamal said, "who leads a troop of the Guides,
And thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.
Till Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,
Thy life is his -- thy fate it is to guard him with thy head.
So, thou must eat the White Queen's meat, and all her foes are thine,
And thou must harry thy father's hold for the peace of the Border-line,
And thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power --
Belike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur."
 
RHYME a a *
 
They have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no fault,
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and salt:
They have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on fire and fresh-cut sod,
On the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the Wondrous Names of God.
The Colonel's son he rides the mare and Kamal's boy the dun,
And two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.
And when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear --
There was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.
"Ha' done! ha' done!" said the Colonel's son. "Put up the steel at your sides!
Last night ye had struck at a Border thief -- to-night 'tis a man of the Guides!"
 
RHYME a a *

Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,
Till Earth and Sky stand presently at God's great Judgment Seat;
But there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,

Udai Chand lay sick to death
    In his hold by Gungra hill.
All night we heard the death-gongs ring
For the soul of the dying Rajpoot King,
All night beat up from the women's wing
    A cry that we could not still.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

All night the barons came and went,
    The lords of the outer guard:
All night the cressets glimmered pale
On Ulwar sabre and Tonk jezail,
Mewar headstall and Marwar mail,
    That clinked in the palace yard.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

In the Golden room on the palace roof
    All night he fought for air:
And there was sobbing behind the screen,
Rustle and whisper of women unseen,
And the hungry eyes of the Boondi Queen
    On the death she might not share.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

He passed at dawn -- the death-fire leaped
    From ridge to river-head,
From the Malwa plains to the Abu scars:
And wail upon wail went up to the stars
Behind the grim zenana-bars,
    When they knew that the King was dead.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

The dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth
    And robe him for the pyre.
The Boondi Queen beneath us cried:
"See, now, that we die as our mothers died
In the bridal-bed by our master's side!
    Out, women! -- to the fire!"
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

We drove the great gates home apace:
    White hands were on the sill:
But ere the rush of the unseen feet
Had reached the turn to the open street,
The bars shot down, the guard-drum beat --
    We held the dovecot still.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

A face looked down in the gathering day,
    And laughing spoke from the wall:
"Oh]/e, they mourn here:  let me by --
Azizun, the  Lucknow nautch-girl, I!
When the house is rotten, the rats must fly,
    And I seek another thrall.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

"For I ruled the King as ne'er did Queen, --
    To-night the Queens rule me!
Guard them safely, but let me go,
Or ever they pay the debt they owe
In scourge and torture!"  She leaped below,
    And the grim guard watched her flee.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

They knew that the King had spent his soul
    On a North-bred dancing-girl:
That he prayed to a flat-nosed Lucknow god,
And kissed the ground where her feet had trod,
And doomed to death at her drunken nod,
    And swore by her lightest curl.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

We bore the King to his fathers' place,
    Where the tombs of the Sun-born stand:
Where the gray apes swing, and the peacocks preen
On fretted pillar and jewelled screen,
And the wild boar couch in the house of the Queen
    On the drift of the desert sand.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

The herald read his titles forth,
    We set the logs aglow:
"Friend of the English, free from fear,
Baron of Luni to Jeysulmeer,
Lord of the Desert of Bikaneer,
    King of the Jungle, -- go!"
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

All night the red flame stabbed the sky
    With wavering wind-tossed spears:
And out of a shattered temple crept
A woman who veiled her head and wept,
And called on the King -- but the great King slept,
    And turned not for her tears.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

Small thought had he to mark the strife --
    Cold fear with hot desire --
When thrice she leaped from the leaping flame,
And thrice she beat her breast for shame,
And thrice like a wounded dove she came
    And moaned about the fire.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

One watched, a bow-shot from the blaze,
    The silent streets between,
Who had stood by the King in sport and fray,
To blade in ambush or boar at bay,

He said:  "O shameless, put aside
    The veil upon thy brow!
Who held the King and all his land
To the wanton will of a harlot's hand!
Will the white ash rise from the blistered brand?
    Stoop down, and call him now!"
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

Then she:  "By the faith of my tarnished soul,
    All things I did not well,
I had hoped to clear ere the fire died,
And lay me down by my master's side
To rule in Heaven his only bride,
    While the others howl in Hell.
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

"But I have felt the fire's breath,
    And hard it is to die!
Yet if I may pray a Rajpoot lord
To sully the steel of a Thakur's sword
With base-born blood of a trade abhorred," --
    And the Thakur answered, "Ay."
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

He drew and struck:  the straight blade drank
    The life beneath the breast.
"I had looked for the Queen to face the flame,
But the harlot dies for the Rajpoot dame --
Sister of mine, pass, free from shame,
    Pass with thy King to rest!"
 
RHYME a b c c c b 

The black log crashed above the white:
    The little flames and lean,
Red as slaughter and blue as steel,
That whistled and fluttered from head to heel,
Leaped up anew, for they found their meal
    On the heart of -- the Boondi Queen!

Before the old Peshawur Gate, where Kurd and Kaffir meet,
The Governor of Kabul dealt the Justice of the Street,
And that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife,
Tho' he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life.
 
RHYME a a *
 
There was a hound of Hindustan had struck a Euzufzai,
Wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die.
It chanced the King went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife;
The Kaffir grovelled under-hoof and clamoured for his life.
 
RHYME a a *
 
Then said the King:  "Have hope, O friend!  Yea, Death disgraced is hard;
Much honour shall be thine"; and called the Captain of the Guard,
Yar Khan, a bastard of the Blood, so city-babble saith,
And he was honoured of the King -- the which is salt to Death;
And he was son of Daoud Shah, the Reiver of the Plains,
And blood of old Durani Lords ran fire in his veins;
And 'twas to tame an Afghan pride nor Hell nor Heaven could bind,
The King would make him butcher to a yelping cur of Hind.
 
RHYME a a *
 
"Strike!" said the King.  "King's blood art thou --  his death shall be his pride!"
Then louder, that the crowd might catch:  "Fear not -- his arms are tied!"
Yar Khan drew clear the Khyber knife, and struck, and sheathed again.
"O man, thy will is done," quoth he; "a King this dog hath slain."

          Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief, to the North and the South is sold.

That night before the watch was set, when all the streets were clear,
The Governor of Kabul spoke:  "My King, hast thou no fear?
Thou knowest -- thou hast heard," -- his speech died at his master's face.
And grimly said the Afghan King:  "I rule the Afghan race.
My path is mine -- see thou to thine -- to-night upon thy bed
Think who there be in Kabul now that clamour for thy head."
 
RHYME a a *
 
That night when all the gates were shut to City and to throne,
Within a little garden-house the King lay down alone.
Before the sinking of the moon, which is the Night of Night,
Yar Khan came softly to the King to make his honour white.
The children of the town had mocked beneath his horse's hoofs,
The harlots of the town had hailed him "butcher!" from their roofs.
But as he groped against the wall, two hands upon him fell,
The King behind his shoulder spake:  "Dead man, thou dost not well!
'Tis ill to jest with Kings by day and seek a boon by night;
And that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write.
But three days hence, if God be good, and if thy strength remain,
Thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain.
For I am merciful to all, and most of all to thee.
My butcher of the shambles, rest -- no knife hast thou for me!"

RHYME a a *
 
Abdhur Rahman, the Durani Chief, holds hard by the South and the North;
But the Ghilzai knows, ere the melting snows, when the swollen banks break forth,
When the red-coats crawl to the sungar wall, and his Usbeg lances fail:
Ye have heard the song -- How long?  How long? Wolves of the Zuka Kheyl!

They stoned him in the rubbish-field when dawn was in the sky,
According to the written word, "See that he do not die."

They stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain,
And those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again.
 
RHYME a a 

One watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing,
And him the King with laughter called the Herald of the King.
 
RHYME a a 

It was upon the second night, the night of Ramazan,
The watcher leaning earthward heard the message of Yar Khan.

RHYME a a 

From shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath,
"Creature of God, deliver me from agony of Death."
 
RHYME a a 

They sought the King among his girls, and risked their lives thereby:
"Protector of the Pitiful, give orders that he die!"
 
RHYME a a 

"Bid him endure until the day," a lagging answer came;
"The night is short, and he can pray and learn to bless my name."

Before the dawn three times he spoke, and on the day once more:
"Creature of God, deliver me, and bless the King therefor!"

They shot him at the morning prayer, to ease him of his pain,
And when he heard the matchlocks clink, he blessed the King again.

When spring-time flushes the desert grass,
Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass.
Lean are the camels but fat the frails,
Light are the purses but heavy the bales,
As the snowbound trade of the North comes down
To the market-square of Peshawur town.
 
RHYME a a *
 
In a turquoise twilight, crisp and chill,
A kafila camped at the foot of the hill.
Then blue smoke-haze of the cooking rose,
And tent-peg answered to  hammer-nose;
And the picketed ponies, shag and wild,
Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled;
And the bubbling camels beside the load
Sprawled for a furlong adown the road;
And the Persian pussy-cats, brought for sale,
Spat at the dogs from the camel-bale;
And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food;
And the camp-fires twinkled by Fort Jumrood;
And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
A savour of camels and carpets and musk,
A murmur of voices, a reek of smoke,
To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke.
 
RHYME a a *
 
The lid of the flesh-pot chattered high,
The knives were whetted and -- then came I

RHYME a a a 

To Mahbub Ali the muleteer,
Patching his bridles and counting his gear,
Crammed with the gossip of half a year.

RHYME a a *

But Mahbub Ali the kindly said,
"Better is speech when the belly is fed."
So we plunged the hand to the mid-wrist deep
In a cinnamon stew of the fat-tailed sheep,
And he who never hath tasted the food,
By Allah! he knoweth not bad from good.
 
RHYME a a *
 
We cleansed our beards of the mutton-grease,
We lay on the mats and were filled with peace,
And the talk slid north, and the talk slid south,
With the sliding puffs from the hookah-mouth.
Four things greater than all things are, --
Women and Horses and Power and War.
We spake of them all, but the last the most,
For I sought a word of a Russian post,
Of a shifty promise, an unsheathed sword
And a gray-coat guard on the Helmund ford.
Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes
In the fashion of one who is weaving lies.
Quoth he:  "Of the Russians who can say?
When the night is gathering all is gray.
But we look that the gloom of the night shall die
In the morning flush of a blood-red sky.
Friend of my heart, is it meet or wise
To warn a King of his enemies?
We know what Heaven or Hell may bring,
But no man knoweth the mind of the King.
That unsought counsel is cursed of God
Attesteth the story of Wali Dad.
 
RHYME a a *
 
"His sire was leaky of tongue and pen,
His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen;
And the colt bred close to the vice of each,
For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech.
Therewith madness -- so that he sought
The favour of kings at the Kabul court;
And travelled, in hope of honour, far
To the line where the gray-coat squadrons are.
There have I journeyed too -- but I
Saw naught, said naught, and -- did not die!
He harked to rumour, and snatched at a breath
Of `this one knoweth' and `that one saith', --
Legends that ran from mouth to mouth
Of a gray-coat coming, and sack of the South.
These have I also heard -- they pass
With each new spring and the winter grass.
 
RHYME a a *
 
"Hot-foot southward, forgotten of God,
Back to the city ran Wali Dad,
Even to Kabul -- in full durbar
The King held talk with his Chief in War.
Into the press of the crowd he broke,
And what he had heard of the coming spoke.
 
RHYME a a *
 
"Then Gholam Hyder, the Red Chief, smiled,
As a mother might on a babbling child;
But those who would laugh restrained their breath,
When the face of the King showed dark as death.
Evil it is in full durbar
To cry to a ruler of gathering war!
Slowly he led to a peach-tree small,
That grew by a cleft of the city wall.
And he said to the boy:  `They shall praise thy zeal
So long as the red spurt follows the steel.
And the Russ is upon us even now?
Great is thy prudence -- await them, thou.
Watch from the tree.  Thou art young and strong,
Surely thy vigil is not for long.
The Russ is upon us, thy clamour ran?
Surely an hour shall bring their van.
Wait and watch.  When the host is near,
Shout aloud that my men may hear.'
 
RHYME a a *
 
"Friend of my heart, is it meet or wise
To warn a King of his enemies?
A guard was set that he might not flee --
A score of bayonets ringed the tree.
The peach-bloom fell in showers of snow,
When he shook at his death as he looked below.
By the power of God, who alone is great,
Till the seventh day he fought with his fate.
Then madness took him, and men declare
He mowed in the branches as ape and bear,
And last as a sloth, ere his body failed,
And he hung as a bat in the forks, and wailed,
And sleep the cord of his hands untied,
And he fell, and was caught on the points and died.
 
RHYME a a *
 
"Heart of my heart, is it meet or wise
To warn a King of his enemies?
We know what Heaven or Hell may bring,
But no man knoweth the mind of the King.
Of the gray-coat coming who can say?
When the night is gathering all is gray.
Two things greater than all things are,
The first is Love, and the second War.
And since we know not how War may prove,
Heart of my heart, let us talk of Love!"

The wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck,
 Our hands and scarfs were saffron-dyed for signal of despair,
When we went forth to Paniput to battle with the ~Mlech~, --
 Ere we came back from Paniput and left a kingdom there.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Thrice thirty thousand men were we to force the Jumna fords --
 The hawk-winged horse of Damajee, mailed squadrons of the Bhao,
Stark levies of the southern hills, the Deccan's sharpest swords,
 And he the harlot's traitor son the goatherd Mulhar Rao!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Thrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared,
 The low white mists of morning heard the war-conch scream and bray;
We called upon Bhowani and we gripped them by the beard,
 We rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
The children of the hills of Khost before our lances ran,
 We drove the black Rohillas back as cattle to the pen;
'Twas then we needed Mulhar Rao to end what we began,
 A thousand men had saved the charge; he fled the field with ten!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
There was no room to clear a sword -- no power to strike a blow,
 For foot to foot, ay, breast to breast, the battle held us fast --
Save where the naked hill-men ran, and stabbing from below
 Brought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
To left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood --
 To right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade --
Above the dark ~Upsaras~* flew, beneath us plashed the blood,
 And, bellying black against the dust, the Bhagwa Jhanda swayed.
  
RHYME a b a b 
 
I saw it fall in smoke and fire, the banner of the Bhao;
 I heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain: --
"Ho! Anand Rao Nimbalkhur, ride!  Get aid of Mulhar Rao!
 Go shame his squadrons into fight -- the Bhao -- the Bhao is slain!"
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Thereat, as when a sand-bar breaks in clotted spume and spray --
 When rain of later autumn sweeps the Jumna water-head,
Before their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way;
 But of the waters of that flood the Jumna fords ran red.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
I held by Scindia, my lord, as close as man might hold;
 A Soobah of the Deccan asks no aid to guard his life;
But Holkar's Horse were flying, and our chiefest chiefs were cold,
 And like a flame among us leapt the long lean Northern knife.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
I held by Scindia -- my lance from butt to tuft was dyed,
 The froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridle-chain --
What time beneath our horses' feet a maiden rose and cried,
 And clung to Scindia, and I turned a sword-cut from the twain.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
(He set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago,
 A hunter by the Tapti banks she gave him water there:
He turned her heart to water, and she followed to her woe.
 What need had he of Lalun who had twenty maids as fair?)
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Now in that hour strength left my lord; he wrenched his mare aside;
 He bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free.
Across the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride
 From Paniput to Delhi town, but not alone were we.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
'Twas Lutuf-Ullah Populzai laid horse upon our track,
 A swine-fed reiver of the North that lusted for the maid;
I might have barred his path awhile, but Scindia called me back,
 And  I -- O woe for Scindia! -- I listened and obeyed.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
League after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by --
 League after league the white road swirled behind the white mare's feet --
League after league, when leagues were done, we heard the Populzai,
 Where sure as Time and swift as Death the tireless footfall beat.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Noon's eye beheld that shame of flight, the shadows fell, we fled
 Where steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train;
The black wolf warred where we had warred, the jackal mocked our dead,
 And terror born of twilight-tide made mad the labouring brain.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
I gasped: -- "A kingdom waits my lord; her love is but her own.
 A day shall mar, a day shall cure for her, but what for thee?
Cut loose the girl:  he follows fast.  Cut loose and ride alone!"
 Then Scindia 'twixt his blistered lips: -- "My Queens' Queen shall she be!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
"Of all who ate my bread last night 'twas she alone that came
 To seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein!
One shame is mine to-day, what need the weight of double shame?
 If once we reach the Delhi gate, though all be lost, I win!"
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
We rode -- the white mare failed -- her trot a staggering stumble grew, --
 The cooking-smoke of even rose and weltered and hung low;
And still we heard the Populzai and still we strained anew,
 And Delhi town was very near, but nearer was the foe.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Yea, Delhi town was very near when Lalun whispered: -- "Slay!
 Lord of my life, the mare sinks fast -- stab deep and let me die!"
But Scindia would not, and the maid tore free and flung away,
 And turning as she fell we heard the clattering Populzai.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Then Scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath,
 And wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a hand's-breadth in her side --
The hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death --
 The blood had chilled about her heart, she reared and fell and died.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Our Gods were kind.  Before he heard the maiden's piteous scream
 A log upon the Delhi road, beneath the mare he lay --
Lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream;
 The darkness closed about his eyes -- I bore my King away.

RHYME a a 
 
Boh Da Thone was a warrior bold:
His sword and his Snider were bossed with gold,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And the Peacock Banner his henchmen bore
Was stiff with bullion, but stiffer with gore.
 
RHYME a a 
 
He shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak
From the Salween scrub to the Chindwin teak:
 
RHYME a a 
 
He crucified noble, he sacrificed mean,
He filled old ladies with kerosene:
 
RHYME a a 
 
While over the water the papers cried,
"The patriot fights for his countryside!"
 
RHYME a a 
 
But little they cared for the Native Press,
The worn white soldiers in Khaki dress,
 
RHYME a a 
 
Who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre,
Who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire,
 
RHYME a a 
 
Who gave up their lives, at the Queen's Command,
For the Pride of their Race and the Peace of the Land.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Now, first of the foemen of Boh Da Thone
Was Captain O'Neil of the "Black Tyrone",
 
RHYME a a 
 
And his was a Company, seventy strong,
Who hustled that dissolute Chief along.
 
RHYME a a 
 
There were lads from Galway and Louth and Meath
Who went to their death with a joke in their teeth,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And worshipped with fluency, fervour, and zeal
The mud on the boot-heels of "Crook" O'Neil.
 
RHYME a a 
 
But ever a blight on their labours lay,
And ever their quarry would vanish away,
 
RHYME a a 
 
Till the sun-dried boys of the Black Tyrone
Took a brotherly interest in Boh Da Thone:
 
RHYME a a 
 
And, sooth, if pursuit in possession ends,
The Boh and his trackers were best of friends.
 
RHYME a a 
 
The word of a scout -- a march by night --
A rush through the mist -- a scattering fight --
 
RHYME a a 
 
A volley from cover -- a corpse in the clearing --
The glimpse of a loin-cloth and heavy jade earring --
 
RHYME a a 
 
The flare of a village -- the tally of slain --
And. . .the Boh was abroad "on the raid" again!
 
RHYME a a 
 
They cursed their luck, as the Irish will,
They gave him credit for cunning and skill,
 
RHYME a a 
 
They buried their dead, they bolted their beef,
And started anew on the track of the thief
 
RHYME a a 
 
Till, in place of the "Kalends of Greece", men said,
"When Crook and his darlings come back with the head."
 
RHYME a a 
 
They had hunted the Boh from the hills to the plain --
He doubled and broke for the hills again:
 
RHYME a a 
 
They had crippled his power for rapine and raid,
They had routed him out of his pet stockade,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And at last, they came, when the Day Star tired,
To a camp deserted -- a village fired.
 
RHYME a a 
 
A black cross blistered the Morning-gold,
And the body upon it was stark and cold.
 
RHYME a a 
 
The wind of the dawn went merrily past,
The high grass bowed her plumes to the blast.
 
RHYME a a 
 
And out of the grass, on a sudden, broke
A spirtle of fire, a whorl of smoke --
 
RHYME a a a 

And Captain O'Neil of the Black Tyrone
Was blessed with a slug in the ulnar-bone --
The gift of his enemy Boh Da Thone.
 
RHYME a a 

(Now a slug that is hammered from telegraph-wire
Is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire.)
 
RHYME a a 
 
The shot-wound festered -- as shot-wounds may
In a steaming barrack at Mandalay.
 
RHYME a a 
 
The left arm throbbed, and the Captain swore,
"I'd like to be after the Boh once more!"
 
RHYME a a 
 
The fever held him -- the Captain said,
"I'd give a hundred to look at his head!"
 
RHYME a a 
 
The Hospital punkahs creaked and whirred,
But Babu Harendra (Gomashta) heard.
 
RHYME a a 
 
He thought of the cane-brake, green and dank,
That girdled his home by the Dacca tank.
 
RHYME a a 
 
He thought of his wife and his High School son,
He thought -- but abandoned the thought -- of a gun.
 
RHYME a a 
 
His sleep was broken by visions dread
Of a shining Boh with a silver head.
 
RHYME a a 
 
He kept his counsel and went his way,
And swindled the cartmen of half their pay.
  
RHYME a a 
 
And the months went on, as the worst must do,
And the Boh returned to the raid anew.
 
RHYME a a 
 
But the Captain had quitted the long-drawn strife,
And in far Simoorie had taken a wife.
 
RHYME a a 
 
And she was a damsel of delicate mould,
With hair like the sunshine and heart of gold,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And little she knew the arms that embraced
Had cloven a man from the brow to the waist:
 
RHYME a a 
 
And little she knew that the loving lips
Had ordered a quivering life's eclipse,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And the eye that lit at her lightest breath
Had glared unawed in the Gates of Death.
 
RHYME a a 
 
(For these be matters a man would hide,
As a general rule, from an innocent Bride.)
 
RHYME a a 
 
And little the Captain thought of the past,
And, of all men, Babu Harendra last.
  
RHYME a a 
 
But slow, in the sludge of the Kathun road,
The Government Bullock Train toted its load.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Speckless and spotless and shining with ~ghee~,
In the rearmost cart sat the Babu-jee.
 
RHYME a a 
 
And ever a phantom before him fled
Of a scowling Boh with a silver head.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Then the lead-cart stuck, though the coolies slaved,
And the cartmen flogged and the escort raved;
 
RHYME a a 
 
And out of the jungle, with yells and squeals,
Pranced Boh Da Thone, and his gang at his heels!
 
RHYME a a 
 
Then belching blunderbuss answered back
The Snider's snarl and the carbine's crack,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And the blithe revolver began to sing
To the blade that twanged on the locking-ring,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And the brown flesh blued where the bay'net kissed,
As the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And the great white bullocks with onyx eyes
Watched the souls of the dead arise,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And over the smoke of the fusillade
The Peacock Banner staggered and swayed.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Oh, gayest of scrimmages man may see
Is a well-worked rush on the G.B.T.!
 
RHYME a a 
 
The Babu shook at the horrible sight,
And girded his ponderous loins for flight,
 
RHYME a a 
 
But Fate had ordained that the Boh should start
On a lone-hand raid of the rearmost cart,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And out of that cart, with a bellow of woe,
The Babu fell -- flat on the top of the Boh!
 
RHYME a a 
 
For years had Harendra served the State,
To the growth of his purse and the girth of his ~p]^et~.
 
RHYME a a 
 
There were twenty stone, as the tally-man knows,
On the broad of the chest of this best of Bohs.
 
RHYME a a 
 
And twenty stone from a height discharged
Are bad for a Boh with a spleen enlarged.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Oh, short was the struggle -- severe was the shock --
He dropped like a bullock -- he lay like a block;
 
RHYME a a 
 
And the Babu above him, convulsed with fear,
Heard the labouring life-breath hissed out in his ear.
 
RHYME a a 
 
And thus in a fashion undignified
The princely pest of the Chindwin died.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Turn now to Simoorie where, lapped in his ease,
The Captain is petting the Bride on his knees,
 
RHYME a a 
 
Where the ~whit~ of the bullet, the wounded man's scream
Are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream --
 
RHYME a a 
 
Forgotten, forgotten the sweat of the shambles
Where the hill-daisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols,
 
RHYME a a 
 
From the sword-belt set free and released from the steel,
The Peace of the Lord is with Captain O'Neil.
 
RHYME a a 
 
Up the hill to Simoorie -- most patient of drudges --
The bags on his shoulder, the mail-runner trudges.
 
RHYME a a 
 
"For Captain O'Neil, ~Sahib~.  One hundred and ten
Rupees to collect on delivery."     Then
 
RHYME a a 
 
(Their breakfast was stopped while the screw-jack and hammer
Tore waxcloth, split teak-wood, and chipped out the dammer;)
 
RHYME a a 
 
Open-eyed, open-mouthed, on the napery's snow,
With a crash and a thud, rolled -- the Head of the Boh!

And gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran: --
   "IN FIELDING FORCE SERVICe    ~Encampment~, 10th Jan.

As a horse reaches up to the manger above,

From the arms of the Bride, iron-visaged and slow,

And e'en as he looked on the Thing where It lay
'Twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins' array,
 
RHYME a a 
 
The freed mind fled back to the long-ago days --
The hand-to-hand scuffle -- the smoke and the blaze --
 
RHYME a a 
 
The forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn --
The banjo at twilight, the burial ere morn --
 
RHYME a a 
 
The stench of the marshes -- the raw, piercing smell
When the overhand stabbing-cut silenced the yell --

The oaths of his Irish that surged when they stood
Where the black crosses hung o'er the Kuttamow flood.
 
RHYME a a 
 
As a derelict ship drifts away with the tide
The Captain went out on the Past from his Bride,

Back, back, through the springs to the chill of the year,
When he hunted the Boh from Maloon to Tsaleer.
 
RHYME a a 
 
As the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water,
In his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter,
 
RHYME a a 
 
And men who had fought with O'Neil for the life
Had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife.
 
RHYME a a 
 
For she who had held him so long could not hold him --
Though a four-month Eternity should have controlled him --
 
RHYME a a 
 
But watched the twin Terror -- the head turned to head --
The scowling, scarred Black, and the flushed savage Red --
 
RHYME a a 
 
The spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to
Some grim hidden Past she had never a clue to.
 
RHYME a a 
 
But It knew as It grinned, for he touched it unfearing,
And muttered aloud, "So you kept that jade earring!"
 
RHYME a a 
 
Then nodded, and kindly, as friend nods to friend,
"Old man, you fought well, but you lost in the end."

The visions departed, and Shame followed Passion: --
"He took what I said in this horrible fashion,

The Captain came back to the Bride. . .who had fainted.

 That weeps at Shalimar.

They have taken away my long jezail,
 My shield and sabre fine,

And if I fall to your hand afresh
 I give you leave for the sin,
That you cram my throat with the foul pig's flesh,
 And swing me in the skin!
 
TITLE
 
RHYME a a * 
 
   . . . At the close of a winter day,
Their anchors down, by London town, the Three Great Captains lay;
And one was Admiral of the North from Solway Firth to Skye,
And one was Lord of the Wessex coast and all the lands thereby,
And one was Master of the Thames from Limehouse to Blackwall,
And he was Captain of the Fleet -- the bravest of them all.
Their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the sheer,
When there came a certain trading-brig with news of a privateer.
Her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a Northern breeze,
Her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the Eastern seas.
Light she rode in the rude tide-rip, to left and right she rolled,
And the skipper sat on the scuttle-butt and stared at an empty hold.
"I ha' paid Port dues for your Law," quoth he, "and where is the Law ye boast
If I sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a Christian coast?
Ye have smoked the hives of the Laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk,
We tack not now to a Gallang prow or a plunging Pei-ho junk;
I had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
Till I met with a lime-washed Yankee brig that rode off Finisterre.
There were canvas blinds to his bow-gun ports to screen the weight he bore,
And the signals ran for a merchantman from Sandy Hook to the Nore.
He would not fly the Rovers' flag -- the bloody or the black,
But now he floated the Gridiron and now he flaunted the Jack.

RHYME a a * 
 
He spoke of the Law as he crimped my crew -- he swore it was only a loan;
But when I would ask for my own again, he swore it was none of my own.
He has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the Line,
He has stripped my rails of the shaddock-frails and the green unripened pine;
He has taken my bale of dammer and spice I won beyond the seas,
He has taken my grinning heathen gods -- and what should he want o' these?
My foremast would not mend his boom, my deckhouse patch his boats;
He has whittled the two, this Yank Yahoo, to peddle for shoe-peg oats.
I could not fight for the failing light and a rough beam-sea beside,
But I hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied.
Had I had guns (as I had goods) to work my Christian harm,
I had run him up from his quarter-deck to trade with his own yard-arm;

RHYME a a * 
 
I had nailed his ears to my capstan-head, and ripped them off with a saw,
And soused them in the bilgewater, and served them to him raw;
I had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark,
I had towed him aft of his own craft, a bait for his brother shark;
I had lapped him round with cocoa husk, and drenched him with the oil,
And lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil;
I had stripped his hide for my hammock-side, and tasselled his beard i' the mesh,
And spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened flesh;
I had hove him down by the mangroves brown, where the mud-reef sucks and draws,
Moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the land-crab's claws!
He is lazar within and lime without, ye can nose him far enow,
For he carries the taint of a musky ship -- the reek of the slaver's dhow!"

RHYME a a * 
 
The skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold,
And the Captains Three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold,
And the Captains Three called courteously from deck to scuttle-butt: --
"Good Sir, we ha' dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut.
Your words be words of a lawless race, and the Law it standeth thus:
He comes of a race that have never a Law, and he never has boarded us.
We ha' sold him canvas and rope and spar -- we know that his price is fair,
And we know that he weeps for the lack of a Law as he rides off Finisterre.
And since he is damned for a gallows-thief by you and better than you,
We hold it meet that the English fleet should know that we hold him true."
The skipper called to the tall taffrail: -- "And what is that to me?
Did ever you hear of a Yankee brig that rifled a Seventy-three?

RHYME a a * 
 
Do I loom so large from your quarter-deck that I lift like a ship o' the Line?
He has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine.
There is never a Law on the Cocos Keys to hold a white man in,
But we do not steal the niggers' meal, for that is a nigger's sin.
Must he have his Law as a quid to chaw, or laid in brass on his wheel?
Does he steal with tears when he buccaneers? 'Fore Gad, then, why does he steal?"
The skipper bit on a deep-sea word, and the word it was not sweet,
For he could see the Captains Three had signalled to the Fleet.

RHYME a a * 
 
But three and two, in white and blue, the whimpering flags began: --
"We have heard a tale of a -- foreign sail, but he is a merchantman."
The skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the Great Horn Spoon: --
"'Fore Gad, the Chaplain of the Fleet would bless my picaroon!"
By two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air: --
"We have sold our spars to the merchantman -- we know that his price is fair."
The skipper winked his Western eye, and swore by a China storm: --
"They ha' rigged him a Joseph's jury-coat to keep his honour warm."
The halliards twanged against the tops, the bunting bellied broad,
The skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord.

RHYME a a * 
 
Masthead -- masthead, the signal sped by the line o' the British craft;
The skipper called to his Lascar crew, and put her about and laughed: --
"It's mainsail haul, my bully boys all -- we'll out to the seas again --
Ere they set us to paint their pirate saint, or scrub at his grapnel-chain.
It's fore-sheet free, with her head to the sea, and the swing of the unbought brine
We'll make no sport in an English court till we come as a ship o' the Line:

RHYME a a * 
 
Till we come as a ship o' the Line, my lads, of thirty foot in the sheer,
Lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer;
Flying his pluck at our mizzen-truck for weft of Admiralty,
Heaving his head for our dipsey-lead in sign that we keep the sea.
Then fore-sheet home as she lifts to the foam -- we stand on the outward tack,
We are paid in the coin of the white man's trade the bezant is hard, ay, and black.
The frigate-bird shall carry my word to the Kling and the Orang-Laut
How a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a Christian port;
How a man may be robbed in Christian port while Three Great Captains there
Shall dip their flag to a slaver's rag -- to show that his trade is fair!"

 It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 Would sweep the Channel clean,
Wherefore she kept her hatches close
When the merry Channel chops arose,
 To save the bleached marine.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

She had one bow-gun of a hundred ton,
 And a great stern-gun beside;
They dipped their noses deep in the sea,
They racked their stays and stanchions free
 In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 Fell in with a cruiser light
That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
And a pair o' heels wherewith to run
 From the grip of a close-fought fight.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

She opened fire at seven miles --
 As ye shoot at a bobbing cork --
And once she fired and twice she fired,
Till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired
 That lolls upon the stalk.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

"Captain, the bow-gun melts apace,
 The deck-beams break below,
'Twere well to rest for an hour or twain,
And botch the shattered plates again."
 And he answered, "Make it so."
 
RHYME a b c c b 

She opened fire within the mile --
 As ye shoot at the flying duck --
And the great stern-gun shot fair and true,
With the heave of the ship, to the stainless blue,
 And the great stern-turret stuck.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

"Captain, the turret fills with steam,
 The feed-pipes burst below --
You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram,
You can hear the twisted runners jam."
 And he answered, "Turn and go!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 And grimly did she roll;
Swung round to take the cruiser's fire
As the White Whale faces the Thresher's ire
 When they war by the frozen Pole.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

"Captain, the shells are falling fast,
 And faster still fall we;
And it is not meet for English stock
To bide in the heart of an eight-day clock
 The death they cannot see."
 
RHYME a b c c b 

"Lie down, lie down, my bold A.B.,
 We drift upon her beam;
We dare not ram, for she can run;
And dare ye fire another gun,
 And die in the peeling steam?"
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 That carried an armour-belt;
But fifty feet at stern and bow
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow,
 To the hail of the ~Nordenfeldt~.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

"Captain, they hack us through and through;
 The chilled steel bolts are swift!
We have emptied the bunkers in open sea,
Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be."
 And he answered, "Let her drift."
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~,
 Swung round upon the tide,
Her two dumb guns glared south and north,
And the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth,
 And she ground the cruiser's side.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

"Captain, they cry, the fight is done,
 They bid you send your sword."
And he answered, "Grapple her stern and bow.
They have asked for the steel.  They shall have it now;
 Out cutlasses and board!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was our war-ship ~Clampherdown~
 Spewed up four hundred men;
And the scalded stokers yelped delight,
As they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
 Stamp o'er their steel-walled pen.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

They cleared the cruiser end to end,
 From conning-tower to hold.
They fought as they fought in Nelson's fleet;
They were stripped to the waist, they were bare to the feet,
 As it was in the days of old.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was the sinking ~Clampherdown~
 Heaved up her battered side --
And carried a million pounds in steel,
To the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel,
 And the scour of the Channel tide.
 
RHYME a b c c b 

It was the crew of the ~Clampherdown~
 Stood out to sweep the sea,
On a cruiser won from an ancient foe,
As it was in the days of long ago,
 And as it still shall be.

     Seven men from all the world, back to Docks again,
     Rolling down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain:
     Give the girls another drink 'fore we sign away --
     We that took the ~Bolivar~ out across the Bay!
 
RHYME a b a b

We put out from Sunderland loaded down with rails;
 We put back to Sunderland 'cause our cargo shifted;
We put out from Sunderland -- met the winter gales --
 Seven days and seven nights to the Start we drifted.

RHYME a a b b 
 
    Racketing her rivets loose, smoke-stack white as snow,
    All the coals adrift adeck, half the rails below,
    Leaking like a lobster-pot, steering like a dray --
    Out we took the ~Bolivar~, out across the Bay!
 
RHYME a b a b

One by one the Lights came up, winked and let us by;
 Mile by mile we waddled on, coal and fo'c'sle short;
Met a blow that laid us down, heard a bulkhead fly;
 Left the ~Wolf~ behind us with a two-foot list to port.

RHYME a a b b 

    Trailing like a wounded duck, working out her soul;
    Clanging like a smithy-shop after every roll;
    Just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray --
    So we threshed the ~Bolivar~ out across the Bay!
 
RHYME a b a b

'Felt her hog and felt her sag, betted when she'd break;
 Wondered every time she raced if she'd stand the shock;
Heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake;
 Hoped the Lord hud keep his thumb on the plummer-block.

RHYME a a b b 

    Banged against the iron decks, bilges choked with coal;
    Flayed and frozen foot and hand, sick of heart and soul;
    Last we prayed she'd buck herself into judgment Day --
    Hi! we cursed the ~Bolivar~ knocking round the Bay!
 
RHYME a b a b

O her nose flung up to sky, groaning to be still --
 Up and down and back we went, never time for breath;
Then the money paid at Lloyd's caught her by the heel,
 And the stars ran round and round dancin' at our death.

RHYME a a b b 

    Aching for an hour's sleep, dozing off between;
    'Heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green;
    'Watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play --
    That was on the ~Bolivar~, south across the Bay.
 
RHYME a b a b

Once we saw between the squalls, lyin' head to swell --
 Mad with work and weariness, wishin' they was we --
Some damned Liner's lights go by like a long hotel;
 Cheered her from the ~Bolivar~ swampin' in the sea.

RHYME a a b b 

    Then a grayback cleared us out, then the skipper laughed;
    "Boys, the wheel has gone to Hell -- rig the winches aft!
    Yoke the kicking rudder-head -- get her under way!"
    So we steered her, pulley-haul, out across the Bay!
 
RHYME a a b b 

Just a pack o' rotten plates puttied up with tar,
In we came, an' time enough, 'cross Bilbao Bar.
    Overloaded, undermanned, meant to founder, we
    Euchred God Almighty's storm, bluffed the Eternal Sea!

RHYME a a b b 

     Seven men from all the world, back to town again,
     Rollin' down the Ratcliffe Road drunk and raising Cain:
     Seven men from out of Hell.  Ain't the owners gay,
     'Cause we took the "Bolivar" safe across the Bay?

Love and Death once ceased their strife
At the Tavern of Man's Life.
Called for wine, and threw -- alas! --
Each his quiver on the grass.
When the bout was o'er they found
Mingled arrows strewed the ground.
Hastily they gathered then
Each the loves and lives of men.
Ah, the fateful dawn deceived!
Mingled arrows each one sheaved;
Death's dread armoury was stored
With the shafts he most abhorred;
Love's light quiver groaned beneath
Venom-headed darts of Death.
 
RHYME a a a b b 

Thus it was they wrought our woe
At the Tavern long ago.
Tell me, do our masters know,
Loosing blindly as they fly,
Old men love while young men die?

The dead child lay in the shroud,
 And the widow watched beside;
And her mother slept, and the Channel swept
 The gale in the teeth of the tide.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
But the mother laughed at all.
 "I have lost my man in the sea,
And the child is dead.  Be still," she said,
 "What more can ye do to me?"
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
The widow watched the dead,
 And the candle guttered low,
And she tried to sing the Passing Song
 That bids the poor soul go.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
And "Mary take you now," she sang,
 "That lay against my heart."
And "Mary smooth your crib to-night,"
 But she could not say "Depart."
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Then came a cry from the sea,
 But the sea-rime blinded the glass,
And "Heard ye nothing, mother?" she said,
 "'Tis the child that waits to pass."
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
And the nodding mother sighed.
 "'Tis a lambing ewe in the whin,
For why should the christened soul cry out
 That never knew of sin?"
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
"O feet I have held in my hand,
 O hands at my heart to catch,
How should they know the road to go,
 And how should they lift the latch?"
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
They laid a sheet to the door,
 With the little quilt atop,
That it might not hurt from the cold or the dirt,
 But the crying would not stop.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
The widow lifted the latch
 And strained her eyes to see,
And opened the door on the bitter shore
 To let the soul go free.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
There was neither glimmer nor ghost,
 There was neither spirit nor spark,
And "Heard ye nothing, mother?" she said,
 "'Tis crying for me in the dark."
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
And the nodding mother sighed:
 "'Tis sorrow makes ye dull;
Have ye yet to learn the cry of the tern,
 Or the wail of the wind-blown gull?"
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
"The terns are blown inland,
 The gray gull follows the plough.
'Twas never a bird, the voice I heard,
 O mother, I hear it now!"
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
"Lie still, dear lamb, lie still;
 The child is passed from harm,
'Tis the ache in your breast that broke your rest,
 And the feel of an empty arm."
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
She put her mother aside,
 "In Mary's name let be!
For the peace of my soul I must go," she said,
 And she went to the calling sea.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
In the heel of the wind-bit pier,
 Where the twisted weed was piled,
She came to the life she had missed by an hour,
 For she came to a little child.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
She laid it into her breast,
 And back to her mother she came,
But it would not feed and it would not heed,
 Though she gave it her own child's name.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
And the dead child dripped on her breast,
 And her own in the shroud lay stark;
And "God forgive us, mother," she said,
 "We let it die in the dark!"

When the flush of a new-born sun fell first on Eden's green and gold,
Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mould;
And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart,
Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves, "It's pretty, but is it Art?"
 
RHYME a a *
 
Wherefore he called to his wife, and fled to fashion his work anew --
The first of his race who cared a fig for the first, most dread review;
And he left his lore to the use of his sons -- and that was a glorious gain
When the Devil chuckled "Is it Art?" in the ear of the branded Cain.
 
RHYME a a *
 
They fought and they talked in the North and the South,they talked and they fought in the West,
Till the waters rose on the pitiful land, and the poor Red Clay had rest --
Had rest till that dank blank-canvas dawn when the dove was preened to start,
And the Devil bubbled below the keel:  "It's human, but is it Art?"
 
RHYME a a *
 
They builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart,
Till the Devil grunted behind the bricks:  "It's striking, but is it Art?"
The stone was dropped at the quarry-side and the idle derrick swung,
While each man talked of the aims of Art, and each in an alien tongue.
 
RHYME a a *
 
The tale is as old as the Eden Tree -- and new as the new-cut tooth --
For each man knows ere his lip-thatch grows he is master of Art and Truth;
And each man hears as the twilight nears, to the beat of his dying heart,
The Devil drum on the darkened pane:  "You did it, but was it Art?"
 
RHYME a a *
 
We have learned to whittle the Eden Tree to the shape of a surplice-peg,
We have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg,
We know that the tail must wag the dog, for the horse is drawn by the cart;
But the Devil whoops, as he whooped of old:  "It's clever, but is it Art?"
 
RHYME a a *
 
When the flicker of London sun falls faint on the Club-room's green and gold,
The sons of Adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould --
They scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves, and the ink and the anguish start,
For the Devil mutters behind the leaves:  "It's pretty, but is it Art?"
 
RHYME a a *
 
Now, if we could win to the Eden Tree where the Four Great Rivers flow,
And the Wreath of Eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago,
And if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through,
By the favour of God we might know as much -- as our father Adam knew!

 Nothing of play they knew,

 With ploughs and sickles and flails,

 Sullen and bowed and old,
Stooping over the millet,

 Mending a muddy yoke,
Sleeping in mud-walled prisons,
 Steeping their food in smoke.

'Twas when the rain fell steady an' the Ark was pitched an' ready,
 That Noah got his orders for to take the bastes below;
He dragged them all together by the horn an' hide an' feather,
 An' all excipt the Donkey was agreeable to go.

Thin Noah spoke him fairly, thin talked to him sevarely,
 An' thin he cursed him squarely to the glory av the Lord: --

But the wind was always failin', an' 'twas most onaisy sailin',
 An' the ladies in the cabin couldn't stand the stable air;
An' the bastes betwuxt the hatches, they tuk an' died in batches,
 Till Noah said: -- "There's wan av us that hasn't paid his fare!"

Winds of the World, give answer!  They are whimpering to and fro --
And what should they know of England who only England know? --
The poor little street-bred people that vapour and fume and brag,
They are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the English Flag!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Must we borrow a clout from the Boer -- to plaster anew with dirt?
An Irish liar's bandage, or an English coward's shirt?
We may not speak of England; her Flag's to sell or share.
What is the Flag of England?  Winds of the World, declare!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
The North Wind blew: -- "From Bergen my steel-shod vanguards go;
I chase your lazy whalers home from the Disko floe;
By the great North Lights above me I work the will of God,
And the liner splits on the ice-field or the Dogger fills with cod.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"I barred my gates with iron, I shuttered my doors with flame,
Because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came;
I took the sun from their presence, I cut them down with my blast,
And they died, but the Flag of England blew free ere the spirit passed.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"The lean white bear hath seen it in the long, long Arctic night,
The musk-ox knows the standard that flouts the Northern Light:
What is the Flag of England?  Ye have but my bergs to dare,
Ye have but my drifts to conquer.  Go forth, for it is there!"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
The South Wind sighed: -- "From the Virgins my mid-sea course was ta'en
Over a thousand islands lost in an idle main,
Where the sea-egg flames on the coral and the long-backed breakers croon
Their endless ocean legends to the lazy, locked lagoon.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"Strayed amid lonely islets, mazed amid outer keys,
I waked the palms to laughter -- I tossed the scud in the breeze --
Never was isle so little, never was sea so lone,
But over the scud and the palm-trees an English flag was flown.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"I have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the Horn;
I have chased it north to the Lizard -- ribboned and rolled and torn;
I have spread its fold o'er the dying, adrift in a hopeless sea;
I have hurled it swift on the slaver, and seen the slave set free.

"My basking sunfish know it, and wheeling albatross,
Where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the Southern Cross.

The East Wind roared: -- "From the Kuriles, the Bitter Seas, I come,
And me men call the Home-Wind, for I bring the English home.
Look -- look well to your shipping!  By the breath of my mad typhoon
I swept your close-packed Praya and beached your best at Kowloon!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"The reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before,
I raped your richest roadstead -- I plundered Singapore!
I set my hand on the Hoogli; as a hooded snake she rose,
And I flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows.

"Never the lotus closes, never the wild-fowl wake,

Man or woman or suckling, mother or bride or maid --

The West Wind called: -- "In squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
That bear the wheat and cattle lest street-bred people die.
They make my might their porter, they make my house their path,
Till I loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"I draw the gliding fog-bank as a snake is drawn from the hole,
They bellow one to the other, the frighted ship-bells toll,
For day is a drifting terror till I raise the shroud with my breath,
And they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death.

"But whether in calm or wrack-wreath, whether by dark or day,
I heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away,
First of the scattered legions, under a shrieking sky,
Dipping between the rollers, the English Flag goes by.

"The dead dumb fog hath wrapped it -- the frozen dews have kissed --
The naked stars have seen it, a fellow-star in the mist.

Help for a patriot distressed, a spotless spirit hurt,
Help for an honourable clan sore trampled in the dirt!
From Queenstown Bay to Donegal, O listen to my song,
The honourable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Their noble names were mentioned -- O the burning black disgrace! --
By a brutal Saxon paper in an Irish shooting-case;
They sat upon it for a year, then steeled their heart to brave it,
And "coruscating innocence" the learned Judges gave it.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Bear witness, Heaven, of that grim crime beneath the surgeon's knife,
The honourable gentlemen deplored the loss of life!
Bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger,
No man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies,
Like ph]oenixes from Ph]oenix Park (and what lay there) they rise!
Go shout it to the emerald seas -- give word to Erin now,
Her honourable gentlemen are cleared -- and this is how: --
 
RHYME a a * 
 
They only paid the Moonlighter his cattle-hocking price,
They only helped the murderer with counsel's best advice,
But -- sure it keeps their honour white -- the learned Court believes
They never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
They never told the ramping crowd to card a woman's hide,
They never marked a man for death -- what fault of theirs he died? --
They only said "intimidate", and talked and went away --
By God, the boys that did the work were braver men than they!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Their sin it was that fed the fire -- small blame to them that heard --
The "bhoys" get drunk on rhetoric, and madden at a word --
They knew whom they were talking at, if they were Irish too,
The gentlemen that lied in Court, they knew, and well they knew.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
They only took the Judas-gold from Fenians out of jail,
They only fawned for dollars on the blood-dyed Clanna-Gael.
If black is black or white is white, in black and white it's down,
They're only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"Cleared", honourable gentlemen!  Be thankful it's no more: --
The widow's curse is on your house, the dead are at your door.
On you the shame of open shame, on you from North to South
The hand of every honest man flat-heeled across your mouth.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"Less black than we were painted"? -- Faith, no word of black was said;
The lightest touch was human blood, and that, you know, runs red.
It's sticking to your fist to-day for all your sneer and scoff,
And by the Judge's well-weighed word you cannot wipe it off.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Hold up those hands of innocence -- go, scare your sheep together,
The blundering, tripping tups that bleat behind the old bell-wether;
And if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen,
Tell them it's tar that glistens so, and daub them yours again!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"The charge is old"? -- As old as Cain -- as fresh as yesterday;
Old as the Ten Commandments -- have ye talked those laws away?
If words are words, or death is death, or powder sends the ball,
You spoke the words that sped the shot -- the curse be on you all.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"Our friends believe"? -- Of course they do -- as sheltered women may;
But have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay?
They! -- If their own front door is shut,  they'll swear the whole world's warm;
What do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm?
 
RHYME a a * 
 
The secret half a county keeps, the whisper in the lane,
The shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane,
The dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees,
And shows the "bhoys" have heard your talk -- what do they know of these?
 
RHYME a a * 
 
But you -- you know -- ay, ten times more; the secrets of the dead,
Black terror on the country-side by word and whisper bred,
The mangled stallion's scream at night, the tail-cropped heifer's low.
Who set the whisper going first?  You know, and well you know!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
My soul!  I'd sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight,
Pure crime I'd done with my own hand for money, lust, or hate,
Than take a seat in Parliament by fellow-felons cheered,
While one of those "not provens" proved me cleared as you are cleared.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Cleared -- you that "lost" the League accounts -- go, guard our honour still,
Go, help to make our country's laws that broke God's law at will --
One hand stuck out behind the back, to signal "strike again";
The other on your dress-shirt-front to show your heart is clane.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
If black is black or white is white, in black and white it's down,
You're only traitors to the Queen and rebels to the Crown.
If print is print or words are words, the learned Court perpends: --
We are not ruled by murderers, but only -- by their friends.

Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser decreed,
To ease the strong of their burden, to help the weak in their need,
He sent a word to the peoples, who struggle, and pant, and sweat,
That the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
The Lords of Their Hands assembled; from the East and the West they drew --
Baltimore, Lille, and Essen, Brummagem, Clyde, and Crewe.
And some were black from the furnace, and some were brown from the soil,
And some were blue from the dye-vat; but all were wearied of toil.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And the young King said: -- "I have found it, the road to the rest ye seek:
The strong shall wait for the weary, the hale shall halt for the weak;
With the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line,
Ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhood -- sign!"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
The paper lay on the table, the strong heads bowed thereby,
And a wail went up from the peoples: -- "Ay, sign -- give rest, for we die!"
A hand was stretched to the goose-quill, a fist was cramped to scrawl,
When -- the laugh of a blue-eyed maiden ran clear through the council-hall.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And each one heard Her laughing as each one saw Her plain --
Saidie, Mimi, or Olga, Gretchen, or Mary Jane.
And the Spirit of Man that is in Him to the light of the vision woke;
And the men drew back from the paper, as a Yankee delegate spoke: --
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"There's a girl in Jersey City who works on the telephone;
We're going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own,
With gas and water connections, and steam-heat through to the top;
And, W. Hohenzollern, I guess I shall work till I drop."
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And an English delegate thundered: -- "The weak an' the lame be blowed!
I've a berth in the Sou'-West workshops, a home in the Wandsworth Road;
And till the 'sociation has footed my buryin' bill,
I work for the kids an' the missus.  Pull up?  I be damned if I will!"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And over the German benches the bearded whisper ran: --
"Lager, der girls und der dollars, dey makes or dey breaks a man.
If Schmitt haf collared der dollars, he collars der girl deremit;
But if Schmitt bust in der pizness, we collars der girl from Schmitt."
 
RHYME a a * 
 
They passed one resolution: -- "Your sub-committee believe
You can lighten the curse of Adam when you've lightened the curse of Eve.
But till we are built like angels, with hammer and chisel and pen,
We will work for ourself and a woman, for ever and ever, amen."
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Now this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held --
The day that they razored the Grindstone, the day that the Cat was belled,
The day of the Figs from Thistles, the day of the Twisted Sands,
The day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands.

Now Tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in Berkeley Square,
And a Spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair --
A Spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away,
Till he heard as the roar of a rain-fed ford the roar of the Milky Way:
Till he heard the roar of the Milky Way die down and drone and cease,
And they came to the Gate within the Wall where Peter holds the keys.
"Stand up, stand up now, Tomlinson, and answer loud and high
The good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die --
The good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone!"
And the naked soul of Tomlinson grew white as a rain-washed bone.
"O I have a friend on earth," he said, "that was my priest and guide,
And well would he answer all for me if he were by my side."
-- "For that ye strove in neighbour-love it shall be written fair,
But now ye wait at Heaven's Gate and not in Berkeley Square:

RHYME a a * 
 
Though we called your friend from his bed this night,  he could not speak for you,
For the race is run by one and one and never by two and two."
Then Tomlinson looked up and down, and little gain was there,
For the naked stars grinned overhead, and he saw that his soul was bare:
The Wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,
And Tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life.
"This I have read in a book," he said, "and that was told to me,
And this I have thought that another man thought of a Prince in Muscovy."
The good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path,
And Peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath.

RHYME a a * 
 
"Ye have read, ye have heard, ye have thought," he said, "and the tale is yet to run
By the worth of the body that once ye had, give answer -- what ha' ye done?"
Then Tomlinson looked back and forth, and little good it bore,
For the Darkness stayed at his shoulder-blade and Heaven's Gate before: --
"O this I have felt, and this I have guessed, and this I have heard men say,
And this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in Norroway."

RHYME a a * 
 
-- "Ye have read, ye have felt, ye have guessed, good lack! Ye have hampered Heaven's Gate;
There's little room between the stars in idleness to prate!
O none may reach by hired speech of neighbour, priest, and kin
Through borrowed deed to God's good meed that lies so fair within;
Get hence, get hence to the Lord of Wrong, for doom has yet to run,
And. . .the faith that ye share with Berkeley Square uphold you, Tomlinson!"
 
 RHYME a a * 
 
The Spirit gripped him by the hair, and sun by sun they fell
Till they came to the belt of Naughty Stars that rim the mouth of Hell:
The first are red with pride and wrath, the next are white with pain,
But the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again:
They may hold their path, they may leave their path, with never a soul to mark,
They may burn or freeze, but they must not cease  in the Scorn of the Outer Dark.
The Wind that blows between the worlds, it nipped him to the bone,
And he yearned to the flare of Hell-Gate  there as the light of his own hearth-stone.

RHYME a a * 
 
The Devil he sat behind the bars, where the desperate legions drew,
But he caught the hasting Tomlinson and would not let him through.
"Wot ye the price of good pit-coal that I must pay?" said he,
"That ye rank yoursel' so fit for Hell and ask no leave of me?
I am all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that ye should give me scorn,
For I strove with God for your First Father the day that he was born.
Sit down, sit down upon the slag, and answer loud and high
The harm that ye did to the Sons of Men or ever you came to die."
And Tomlinson looked up and up, and saw against the night
The belly of a tortured star blood-red in Hell-Mouth light;
And Tomlinson looked down and down, and saw beneath his feet
The frontlet of a tortured star milk-white in Hell-Mouth heat.
"O I had a love on earth," said he, "that kissed me to my fall,
And if ye would call my love to me I know she would answer all."

RHYME a a * 
 
-- "All that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair,
But now ye wait at Hell-Mouth Gate and not in Berkeley Square:
Though we whistled your love from her bed to-night, I trow she would not run,
For the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one!"
The Wind that blows between the worlds, it cut him like a knife,
And Tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life: --
"Once I ha' laughed at the power of Love and twice at the grip of the Grave,
And thrice I ha' patted my God on the head that men might call me brave."
The Devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool: --
"Do ye think I would waste my good pit-coal on the hide of a brain-sick fool?

RHYME a a * 
 
I see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
That I should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid."
Then Tomlinson looked back and forth, and there was little grace,
For Hell-Gate filled the houseless Soul with the Fear of Naked Space.
"Nay, this I ha' heard," quo'  Tomlinson, "and this was noised abroad,
And this I ha' got from a Belgian book on the word of a dead French lord."
-- "Ye ha' heard, ye ha' read, ye ha' got, good lack! and the tale begins afresh --
Have ye sinned one sin for the pride o' the eye  or the sinful lust of the flesh?"
Then Tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered, "Let me in --
For I mind that I borrowed my neighbour's wife to sin the deadly sin."
The Devil he grinned behind the bars, and banked the fires high:
"Did ye read of that sin in a book?" said he; and Tomlinson said, "Ay!"
The Devil he blew upon his nails, and the little devils ran,
And he said:  "Go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man:
Winnow him out 'twixt star and star, and sieve his proper worth:
There's sore decline in Adam's line if this be spawn of earth."
Empusa's crew, so naked-new they may not face the fire,
But weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire,

RHYME a a * 
 
Over the coal they chased the Soul, and racked it all abroad,
As children rifle a caddis-case or the raven's foolish hoard.
And back they came with the tattered Thing, as children after play,
And they said:  "The soul that he got from God he has bartered clean away.
We have threshed a stook of print and book, and winnowed a chattering wind
And many a soul wherefrom he stole, but his we cannot find:
We have handled him, we have dandled him, we have seared him to the bone,
And sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own."
The Devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low: --
"I'm all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that I should bid him go.
Yet close we lie, and deep we lie, and if I gave him place,
My gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face;

RHYME a a * 
 
They'd call my house a common stews and me a careless host,
And -- I would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost."
The Devil he looked at the mangled Soul that prayed to feel the flame,
And he thought of Holy Charity, but he thought of his own good name: --
"Now ye could haste my coal to waste, and sit ye down to fry:
Did ye think of that theft for yourself?" said he; and Tomlinson said, "Ay!"
The Devil he blew an outward breath, for his heart was free from care: --
"Ye have scarce the soul of a louse," he said,  "but the roots of sin are there,

RHYME a a * 
 
And for that sin should ye come in were I the lord alone.
But sinful pride has rule inside -- and mightier than my own.
Honour and Wit, fore-damned they sit, to each his priest and whore:
Nay, scarce I dare myself go there, and you they'd torture sore.
Ye are neither spirit nor spirk," he said; "ye are neither book nor brute --
Go, get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of Man's repute.
I'm all o'er-sib to Adam's breed that I should mock your pain,
But look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again.

RHYME a a * 
 
Get hence, the hearse is at your door -- the grim black stallions wait --
They bear your clay to place to-day.  Speed, lest ye come too late!
Go back to Earth with a lip unsealed -- go back with an open eye,
And carry my word to the Sons of Men or ever ye come to die:
That the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one --
And. . .the God that you took from a printed book be with you, Tomlinson!"

There's a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield,
 And the ricks stand gray to the sun,
Singing: -- "Over then, come over, for the bee has quit the clover,
 And your English summer's done."

 In the heel of the North-East Trade.
    Can you hear the crash on her bows, dear lass,
    And the drum of the racing screw,
    As she ships it green on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,
    As she lifts and 'scends on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new?
 
RHYME a b c b *
 
See the shaking funnels roar, with the Peter at the fore,
 And the fenders grind and heave,
And the derricks clack and grate, as the tackle hooks the crate,
 And the fall-rope whines through the sheave;
    It's "Gang-plank up and in," dear lass,
    It's "Hawsers warp her through!"
    And it's "All clear aft" on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,
    We're backing down on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.
 
RHYME a b c b *
 
O the mutter overside, when the port-fog holds us tied,
 And the sirens hoot their dread!
When foot by foot we creep o'er the hueless viewless deep
 To the sob of the questing lead!
    It's down by the Lower Hope, dear lass,
    With the Gunfleet Sands in view,
    Till the Mouse swings green on the old trail,      our own trail, the out trail,
    And the Gull Light lifts on the Long Trail --     the trail that is always new.
 
RHYME a b c b *
 
O the blazing tropic night, when the wake's a welt of light
 That holds the hot sky tame,
And the steady fore-foot snores through the planet-powdered floors
 Where the scared whale flukes in flame!
    Her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass,
    And her ropes are taut with the dew,
    For we're booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,
    We're sagging south on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.
 
RHYME a b c b *
 
Then home, get her home, where the drunken rollers comb,
 And the shouting seas drive by,
And the engines stamp and ring, and the wet bows reel and swing,
 And the Southern Cross rides high!
    Yes, the old lost stars wheel back, dear lass,
    That blaze in the velvet blue.
    They're all old friends on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,
    They're God's own guides on the Long Trail --      the trail that is always new.
 
RHYME a b c b *
 
Fly forward, O my heart, from the Foreland to the Start --
 We're steaming all-too slow,
And it's twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
 Where the trumpet-orchids blow!
    You have heard the call of the off-shore wind,
    And the voice of the deep-sea rain;
    You have heard the song -- how long! how long?
    Pull out on the trail again!
 
RHYME a b c b *
 
   The Lord knows what we may find, dear lass,
   And The Deuce knows what we may do --
   But we're back once more on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail,
   We're down, hull down on the Long Trail -- the trail that is always new.

     They count their ships full tale --
      Their corn and oil and wine,

     City by City they hail:

     Deep in all dishonour though we stained our garments' hem.

     We were led by evil counsellors -- the Lord shall deal with them!

     Of your children in their bondage shall He ask them treble-tale!

Our brows are bound with spindrift and the weed is on our knees;
Our loins are battered 'neath us by the swinging, smoking seas.
From reef and rock and skerry -- over headland, ness, and voe --
The Coastwise Lights of England watch the ships of England go!
 
RHYME a a b b 
 
Through the endless summer evenings, on the lineless, level floors;
Through the yelling Channel tempest when the siren hoots and roars --
By day the dipping house-flag and by night the rocket's trail --
As the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail.
 
RHYME a a b b 
 
We bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care,
The flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer;
From our vexed eyries, head to gale, we bind in burning chains
The lover from the sea-rim drawn -- his love in English lanes.
 
RHYME a a b b 
 
We greet the clippers wing-and-wing that race the Southern wool;
We warn the crawling cargo-tanks of Bremen, Leith, and Hull;
To each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea --
The white wall-sided war-ships or the whalers of Dundee!
 
RHYME a a b b 
 
Come up, come in from Eastward, from the guardports of the Morn!
Beat up, beat in from Southerly, O gipsies of the Horn!
Swift shuttles of an Empire's loom that weave us, main to main,
The Coastwise Lights of England give you welcome back again!
 
RHYME a a b b 
 
Go, get you gone up-Channel with the sea-crust on your plates;

     Hear now the Song of the Dead -- in the North by the torn berg-edges --
     They that look still to the Pole, asleep by their hide-stripped sledges.
     Song of the Dead in the South -- in the sun by their skeleton horses,
     Where the warrigal whimpers and bays through the dust

RHYME a a *
 
We were dreamers, dreaming greatly, in the man-stifled town;
We yearned beyond the sky-line where the strange roads go down.
Came the Whisper, came the Vision, came the Power with the Need,
Till the Soul that is not man's soul was lent us to lead.
As the deer breaks -- as the steer breaks -- from the herd where they graze,
In the faith of little children we went on our ways.
Then the wood failed -- then the food failed -- then the last water dried --
In the faith of little children we lay down and died.
On the sand-drift -- on the veldt-side -- in the fern-scrub we lay,
That our sons might follow after by the bones on the way.
Follow after -- follow after!  We have watered the root,
And the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit!
Follow after -- we are waiting, by the trails that we lost,
For the sounds of many footsteps, for the tread of a host.
Follow after -- follow after -- for the harvest is sown:
By the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own!

The wrecks dissolve above us; their dust drops down from afar --
Down to the dark, to the utter dark, where the blind white sea-snakes are.
There is no sound, no echo of sound, in the deserts of the deep,
Or the great gray level plains of ooze where the shell-burred cables creep.
 
RHYME a b a b 

Here in the womb of the world -- here on the tie-ribs of earth
 Words, and the words of men, flicker and flutter and beat --
Warning, sorrow and gain, salutation and mirth --
 For a Power troubles the Still that has neither voice nor feet.

RHYME a b a b 

They have wakened the timeless Things; they have killed their father Time;
 Joining hands in the gloom, a league from the last of the sun.

 And a new Word runs between:  whispering, "Let us be one!"

Treason has much, but we, Mother, thy sons have more!
From the whine of a dying man, from the snarl of a wolf-pack freed,
Turn, and the world is thine.  Mother, be proud of thy seed!
Count, are we feeble or few?  Hear, is our speech so rude?
Look, are we poor in the land?  Judge, are we men of The Blood?
 
RHYME a a *
 
Those that have stayed at thy knees, Mother, go call them in --
We that were bred overseas wait and would speak with our kin.
Not in the dark do we fight -- haggle and flout and gibe;
Selling our love for a price, loaning our hearts for a bribe.
Gifts have we only to-day -- Love without promise or fee --
Hear, for thy children speak, from the uttermost parts of the sea!

 Wealth sought and Kings adventured life to hold.
Hail, England!  I am Asia -- Power on silt,
 Death in my hands, but Gold!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Clive kissed me on the mouth and eyes and brow,
 Wonderful kisses, so that I became
Crowned above Queens -- a withered beldame now,
 Brooding on ancient fame.
 
RHYME a b a b 
  
Hail, Mother!  Do they call me rich in trade?
 Little care I, but hear the shorn priest drone,
And watch my silk-clad lovers, man by maid,
 Laugh 'neath my Shwe Dagon.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Hail, Mother!  East and West must seek my aid
 Ere the spent gear may dare the ports afar.
The second doorway of the wide world's trade
 Is mine to loose or bar.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Hail, Mother!  Hold me fast; my Praya sleeps
  Under innumerable keels to-day.
Yet guard (and landward), or to-morrow sweeps
  Thy war-ships down the bay!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Into the mist my guardian prows put forth,
 Behind the mist my virgin ramparts lie,
The Warden of the Honour of the North,
 Sleepless and veiled am I!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Peace is our portion.  Yet a whisper rose,
 Foolish and causeless, half in jest, half hate.
Now wake we and remember mighty blows,
 And, fearing no man, wait!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
From East to West the circling word has passed,
 Till West is East beside our land-locked blue;
From East to West the tested chain holds fast,
 The well-forged link rings true!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Hail!  Snatched and bartered oft from hand to hand,
 I dream my dream, by rock and heath and pine,
Of Empire to the northward.  Ay, one land
 From Lion's Head to Line!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Greeting!  Nor fear nor favour won us place,
 Got between greed of gold and dread of drouth,
Loud-voiced and reckless as the wild tide-race
 That whips our harbour-mouth!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Greeting!  My birth-stain have I turned to good;
 Forcing strong wills perverse to steadfastness:
The first flush of the tropics in my blood,
 And at my feet Success!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
The northern stirp beneath the southern skies --
 I build a Nation for an Empire's need,
Suffer a little, and my land shall rise,
 Queen over lands indeed!
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
Man's love first found me; man's hate made me Hell;
 For my babes' sake I cleansed those infamies.
Earnest for leave to live and labour well,
 God flung me peace and ease.

Last, loneliest, loveliest, exquisite, apart --
 On us, on us the unswerving season smiles,
Who wonder 'mid our fern why men depart
 To seek the Happy Isles!

RHYME a a *
  
Truly ye come of The Blood; slower to bless than to ban;
Little used to lie down at the bidding of any man.
Flesh of the flesh that I bred, bone of the bone that I bare;
Stark as your sons shall be -- stern as your fathers were.
Deeper than speech our love, stronger than life our tether,
But we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together.
My arm is nothing weak, my strength is not gone by;
Sons, I have borne many sons, but my dugs are not dry.
Look, I have made ye a place and opened wide the doors,
That ye may talk together, your Barons and Councillors --
Wards of the Outer March, Lords of the Lower Seas,
Ay, talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees! --

RHYME a a *
  
That ye may talk together, brother to brother's face --
Thus for the good of your peoples -- thus for the Pride of the Race.
Also, we will make promise.  So long as The Blood endures,
I shall know that your good is mine:  ye shall feel that my strength is yours:
In the day of Armageddon, at the last great fight of all,
That Our House stand together and the pillars do not fall.
Draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands,
And the Law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands.
This for the waxen Heath, and that for the Wattle-bloom,
This for the Maple-leaf, and that for the southern Broom.

RHYME a a *
  
The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will,
Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still.
Now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you,
After the use of the English, in straight-flung words and few.
Go to your work and be strong, halting not in your ways,
Balking the end half-won for an instant dole of praise.
Stand to your work and be wise -- certain of sword and pen,
Who are neither children nor Gods, but men in a world of men!

Mine was the woman to me, darkling I found 
Haling her dumb from the camp, took her and bound 
Hot rose her tribe on our track ere I had proved 
Hearing her laugh in the gloom, greatly I loved 
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
Swift through the forest we ran; none stood to guard 
Few were my people and far; then the flood barred 
Him we call Son of the Sea, sullen and swollen.
Panting we waited the death, stealer and stolen.
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
Yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter,
Lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water;
Holding on high and apart skins that arrayed 
Called she the God of the Wind that He should aid 
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
Life had the tree at that word (Praise we the Giver!)
Otter-like left he the bank for the full river.
Far fell their axes behind, flashing and ringing,
Wonder was on me and fear -- yet she was singing!
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
Low lay the land we had left.  Now the blue bound us,
Even the Floor of the Gods level around us.
Whisper there was not, nor word, shadow nor showing,
Till the light stirred on the deep, glowing and growing.
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
Then did He leap to His place flaring from under,
He the Compeller, the Sun, bared to our wonder.
Nay, not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing,
Cleared He the gate of the world, huge and amazing!
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
This we beheld (and we live) -- the Pit of the Burning!
Then the God spoke to the tree for our returning;
Back to the beach of our flight, fearless and slowly,
Back to our slayers went he:  but we were holy.
 
RHYME a a b b  
 
Men that were hot in that hunt, women that followed,
Babes that were promised our bones, trembled and wallowed:
Over the necks of the Tribe crouching and fawning --
Prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning!
 
TITLE 
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Thus said The Lord in the Vault above the Cherubim
 Calling to the Angels and the Souls in their degree:
  "Lo!  Earth has passed away
  On the smoke of Judgment Day.
 That Our word may be established shall We gather up the sea?"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners:
 "Plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee!
  But the war is done between us,
  In the deep the Lord hath seen us --
 Our bones we'll leave the barracout', and God may sink the sea!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Then said the soul of Judas that betray]\ed Him:
 "Lord, hast Thou forgotten Thy covenant with me?
  How once a year I go
  To cool me on the floe?
 And Ye take my day of mercy if Ye take away the sea!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Then said the soul of the Angel of the Off-shore Wind:
 (He that bits the thunder when the bull-mouthed breakers flee):
  "I have watch and ward to keep
  O'er Thy wonders on the deep,
 And Ye take mine honour from me if Ye take away the sea!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners:
 "Nay, but we were angry, and a hasty folk are we!
  If we worked the ship together
  Till she foundered in foul weather,
 Are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea?"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard:
 "Kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we;
  But Thy arm was strong to save,
  And it touched us on the wave,
 And we drowsed the long tides idle till Thy Trumpets tore the sea."
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Then cried the soul of the stout Apostle Paul to God:
 "Once we frapped a ship, and she laboured woundily.
  There were fourteen score of these,
  And they blessed Thee on their knees,
 When they learned Thy Grace and Glory under Malta by the sea!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,
 Plucking at their harps, and they plucked unhandily:
  "Our thumbs are rough and tarred,
  And the tune is something hard --
 May we lift a Deep-sea Chantey such as seamen use at sea?"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Then said the souls of the gentlemen-adventurers --
 Fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity:
  "Ho, we revel in our chains
  O'er the sorrow that was Spain's;
 Heave or sink it, leave or drink it, we were masters of the sea!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Up spake the soul of a gray Gothavn 'speckshioner --
 (He that led the flinching in the fleets of fair Dundee):
  "Oh, the ice-blink white and near,
  And the bowhead breaching clear!
 Will Ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea?"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Loud sang the souls of the jolly, jolly mariners,
 Crying:  "Under Heaven, here is neither lead nor lee!
  Must we sing for evermore
  On the windless, glassy floor?
 Take back your golden fiddles and we'll beat to open sea!"
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Then stooped the Lord, and He called the good sea up to Him,
 And 'stablished his borders unto all eternity,
  That such as have no pleasure
  For to praise the Lord by measure,
 They may enter into galleons and serve Him on the sea.
 
RHYME a b c c b 
 
Sun, wind, and cloud shall fail not from the face of it,
      Stinging, ringing spindrift, nor the fulmar flying free;
       And the ships shall go abroad
       To the Glory of the Lord
      Who heard the silly sailor-folk and gave them back their sea!

King Solomon drew merchantmen,
 Because of his desire
For peacocks, apes, and ivory,
 From Tarshish unto Tyre:
With cedars out of Lebanon
 Which Hiram rafted down,
But we be only sailormen
 That use in London Town.

     Coastwise -- cross-seas -- round the world and back again --
      Where the flaw shall head us or the full Trade suits --
     Plain-sail -- storm-sail -- lay your board and tack again --
      And that's the way we'll pay Paddy Doyle for his boots!
 
RHYME a b c b *

We bring no store of ingots,
 Of spice or precious stones,
But that we have we gathered
 With sweat and aching bones:
In flame beneath the tropics,
 In frost upon the floe,
And jeopardy of every wind
 That does between them go.
 
RHYME a b c b *

And some we got by purchase,
 And some we had by trade,
And some we found by courtesy
 Of pike and carronade --
At midnight, 'mid-sea meetings,
 For charity to keep,
And light the rolling homeward-bound
 That rode a foot too deep.
 
RHYME a b c b *

By sport of bitter weather
 We're walty, strained, and scarred
From the kentledge on the kelson
 To the slings upon the yard.
Six oceans had their will of us
 To carry all away --
Our galley's in the Baltic,
 And our boom's in Mossel Bay!
 
RHYME a b c b *

We've floundered off the Texel,
 Awash with sodden deals,
We've slipped from Valparaiso
 With the Norther at our heels:
We've ratched beyond the Crossets
 That tusk the Southern Pole,
And dipped our gunnels under
 To the dread Agulhas roll.
 
RHYME a b c b *

Beyond all outer charting
 We sailed where none have sailed,
And saw the land-lights burning
 On islands none have hailed;
Our hair stood up for wonder,
 But, when the night was done,
There danced the deep to windward
 Blue-empty 'neath the sun!
 
RHYME a b c b *

Strange consorts rode beside us
 And brought us evil luck;
The witch-fire climbed our channels,
 And flared on vane and truck:
Till, through the red tornado,
 That lashed us nigh to blind,
We saw The Dutchman plunging,
 Full canvas, head to wind!
 
RHYME a b c b *

We've heard the Midnight Leadsman
 That calls the black deep down --
Ay, thrice we've heard The Swimmer,
 The Thing that may not drown.
On frozen bunt and gasket
 The sleet-cloud drave her hosts,
When, manned by more than signed with us,
 We passed the Isle o' Ghosts!
 
RHYME a b c b *

And north, amid the hummocks,
 A biscuit-toss below,
We met the silent shallop
 That frighted whalers know;
For, down a cruel ice-lane,
 That opened as he sped,
We saw dead Henry Hudson
 Steer, North by West, his dead.
 
RHYME a b c b *

So dealt God's waters with us
 Beneath the roaring skies,
So walked His signs and marvels
 All naked to our eyes:
But we were heading homeward
 With trade to lose or make --
Good Lord, they slipped behind us
 In the tailing of our wake!

Let go, let go the anchors;
 Now shamed at heart are we
To bring so poor a cargo home

 Ah, fools were we and blind --
The worst we stored with utter toil,
 The best we left behind!
 
RHYME a b a b 

     Coastwise -- cross-seas -- round the world and back again,
      Whither flaw shall fail us or the Trades drive down:
     Plain-sail -- storm-sail -- lay your board and tack again --
      And all to bring a cargo up to London Town!

I sent a message to my dear --
 A thousand leagues and more to Her --
The dumb sea-levels thrilled to hear,
 And Lost Atlantis bore to Her.

Behind my message hard I came,
 And nigh had found a grave for me;
But that I launched of steel and flame
 Did war against the wave for me.

Earth sold her chosen men of strength
 (They lived and strove and died for me)
To drive my road a nation's length,
 And toss the miles aside for me.

I snatched their toil to serve my needs --
 Too slow their fleetest flew for me --
I tired twenty smoking steeds,
 And bade them bait a new for me.

 Where hour by hour She waited me.
Among ten million one was She,

 Ah, day no tongue shall tell again!

RHYME a a *
 
Now this is the Law of the Muscovite, that he proves with shot and steel,
When ye come by his isles in the Smoky Sea ye must not take the seal,
Where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weed-hung shelves,
And the little blue fox he is bred for his skin and the seal they breed for themselves;
For when the ~matkas~ seek the shore to drop their pups aland,
The great man-seal haul out of the sea, a-roaring, band by band;
And when the first September gales have slaked their rutting-wrath,
The great man-seal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path.
Then dark they lie and stark they lie -- rookery, dune, and floe,
And the Northern Lights come down o' nights to dance with the houseless snow;
And God Who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe,
He hears the cry of the little kit-fox and the wind along the snow.
But since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear,
The sealing-boats they filch that way at hazard year by year.
English they be and Japanee that hang on the Brown Bear's flank,
And some be Scot, but the worst of the lot, and the boldest thieves, be Yank!
 
RHYME a a *

It was the sealer ~Northern Light~, to the Smoky Seas she bore,
With a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the Russian flag at her fore.
(~Baltic~, ~Stralsund~, and ~Northern Light~ -- oh! they were birds of a feather --
Slipping away to the Smoky Seas, three seal-thieves together!)
And at last she came to a sandy cove and the Baltic lay therein,
But her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin.
There were fifteen hundred skins abeach, cool pelt and proper fur,
When the ~Northern Light~ drove into the bight  and the sea-mist drove with her.
The ~Baltic~ called her men and weighed -- she could not choose but run --
For a stovepipe seen through the closing mist, it shows like a four-inch gun.

RHYME a a *
 
(And loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship
And lie for a rotting contraband on Vladivostock slip.)
She turned and dived in the sea-smother as a rabbit dives in the whins,
And the ~Northern Light~ sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins.
They had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear,
When they were aware of a sloop-of-war, ghost-white and very near.
Her flag she showed, and her guns she showed -- three of them, black, abeam,
And a funnel white with the crusted salt, but never a show of steam.
 
RHYME a a *
 
There was no time to man the brakes, they knocked the shackle free,
And the ~Northern Light~ stood out again, goose-winged to open sea.
(For life it is that is worse than death, by force of Russian law
To work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw.)
They had not run a mile from shore -- they heard no shots behind --
When the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind:
"Bluffed -- raised out on a bluff," said he, "for if my name's Tom Hall,
You must set a thief to catch a thief -- and a thief has caught us all!
By every butt in Oregon and every spar in Maine,
The hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of Reuben Paine!
He has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar,  and, faith, he has faked her well --
But I'd know the ~Stralsund~'s deckhouse yet from here to the booms o' Hell.

RHYME a a *
 
Oh, once we ha' met at Baltimore, and twice on Boston pier,
But the sickest day for you, Reuben Paine, was the day that you came here --
The day that you came here, my lad, to scare us from our seal
With your funnel made o' your painted cloth, and your guns o' rotten deal!
Ring and blow for the ~Baltic~ now, and head her back to the bay,
And we'll come into the game again -- with a double deck to play!"
 
RHYME a a *
 
They rang and blew the sealers' call -- the poaching cry of the sea --
And they raised the ~Baltic~ out of the mist, and an angry ship was she:
And blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again,
Till they heard the creak of the ~Stralsund~'s boom  and the clank of her mooring chain.
They laid them down by bitt and boat, their pistols in their belts,
And:  "Will you fight for it, Reuben Paine, or will you share the pelts?"
 
RHYME a a *
 
A dog-toothed laugh laughed Reuben Paine, and bared his flenching-knife.
"Yea, skin for skin, and all that he hath a man will give for his life;
But I've six thousand skins below, and Yeddo Port to see,
And there's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three:
So go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill,
And I'll be good to your seal this catch, as many as I shall kill!"
 
RHYME a a *
 
Answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gun-butt slid,
But the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did.
The weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak,
And the flame-spurts pale ran down the rail as the sealing-rifles spoke.
The bullets bit on bend and butt, the splinter slivered free
(Little they trust to sparrow-dust that stop the seal in his sea!),
The thick smoke hung and would not shift, leaden it lay and blue,
But three were down on the ~Baltic~'s deck and two of the ~Stralsund~'s crew.
An arm's-length out and overside the banked fog held them bound,
But, as they heard or groan or word, they fired at the sound.

RHYME a a *
 
For one cried out on the Name of God, and one to have him cease,
And the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace;
And one called out on a heathen joss and one on the Virgin's Name,
And the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came.
And in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath,
And each man drew his watchful breath slow taken 'tween the teeth --
Trigger and ear and eye acock, knit brow and hard-drawn lips --
Bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships.
Till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath,
Till they heard the torment of Reuben Paine that wailed upon his death:
 
RHYME a a *
 
"The tides they'll go through Fundy Race but I'll go nevermore
And see the hogs from ebb-tide mark turn scampering back to shore.
No more I'll see the trawlers drift below the Bass Rock ground,
Or watch the tall Fall steamer lights tear blazing up the Sound.
Sorrow is me, in a lonely sea and a sinful fight I fall,
But if there's law o' God or man you'll swing for it yet, Tom Hall!"
Tom Hall stood up by the quarter-rail.  "Your words in your teeth," said he.
"There's never a law of God or man runs north of Fifty-Three.
So go in grace with Him to face, and an ill-spent life behind,
And I'll be good to your widows, Rube, as many as I shall find."
 
RHYME a a *
 
A ~Stralsund~ man shot blind and large, and a war-lock Finn was he,
And he hit Tom Hall with a bursting ball a hand's-breadth over the knee.
Tom Hall caught hold by the topping-lift, and sat him down with an oath,
"You'll wait a little, Rube," he said, "the Devil has called for both.
The Devil is driving both this tide, and the killing-grounds are close,
And we'll go up to the Wrath of God as the holluschickie goes.
O men, put back your guns again and lay your rifles by,
We've fought our fight, and the best are down.  Let up and let us die!

RHYME a a *
 
Quit firing, by the bow there -- quit!  Call off the ~Baltic~'s crew!
You're sure of Hell as me or Rube -- but wait till we get through."
There went no word between the ships, but thick and quick and loud
The life-blood drummed on the dripping decks,  with the fog-dew from the shroud,
The sea-pull drew them side by side, gunnel to gunnel laid,
And they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear, but never a word was said.
 
RHYME a a *
 
Then Reuben Paine cried out again before his spirit passed:
"Have I followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last?
Curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind --
I have gotten my death where I got my bread, but I dare not face it blind.
Curse on the fog!  Is there never a wind of all the winds I knew
To clear the smother from off my chest, and let me look at the blue?"
The good fog heard -- like a splitten sail, to left and right she tore,
And they saw the sun-dogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore.

RHYME a a *
 
Silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steel-backed tide,
And pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside.
O rainbow-gay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread,
And gold, raw gold, the spent shell rolled between the careless dead --
The dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee,
And they saw the work their hands had done as God had bade them see.
 
RHYME a a *
 
And a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift,
But no man stood by wheel or sheet, and they let the schooners drift.
And the rattle rose in Reuben's throat and he cast his soul with a cry,
And "Gone already?" Tom Hall he said.  "Then it's time for me to die."
His eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land,
And he spoke as a man that talks in dreams, his wound beneath his hand.
"Oh, there comes no good o' the westering wind that backs against the sun;
Wash down the decks -- they're all too red -- and share the skins and run,
~Baltic~, ~Stralsund~, and ~Northern Light~ -- clean share and share for all,
You'll find the fleets off Tolstoi Mees, but you will not find Tom Hall.
Evil he did in shoal-water and blacker sin on the deep,
But now he's sick of watch and trick and now he'll turn and sleep.

RHYME a a *
 
He'll have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so,
But he'll lie down on the killing-grounds where the holluschickie go.
And west you'll sail and south again, beyond the sea-fog's rim,
And tell the Yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him.
And you'll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside,
But carry him up to the sand-hollows to die as Bering died,
And make a place for Reuben Paine that knows the fight was fair,
And leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there!"
 
RHYME a a *
 
     Half-steam ahead by guess and lead, for the sun is mostly veiled --
     Through fog to fog, by luck and log, sail ye as Bering sailed;
     And if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain,
     North and by west, from Zapne Crest, ye raise the Crosses Twain.
     Fair marks are they to the inner bay, the reckless poacher knows
     What time the scarred see-catchie lead their sleek seraglios.

RHYME a a *
 
     Ever they hear the floe-pack clear, and the blast of the old bull-whale,
     And the deep seal-roar that beats off-shore above the loudest gale.
     Ever they wait the winter's hate as the thundering ~boorga~ calls,
     Where northward look they to St. George, and westward to St. Paul's.
     Ever they greet the hunted fleet -- lone keels off headlands drear --
     When the sealing-schooners flit that way at hazard year by year.

RHYME a b b a 

     Ever in Yokohama port men tell the tale anew
      Of a hidden sea and a hidden fight,
      When the ~Baltic~ ran from the ~Northern Light~
     And the ~Stralsund~ fought the two.

A Rose, in tatters on the garden path,
Cried out to God and murmured 'gainst His Wrath,
Because a sudden wind at twilight's hush
Had snapped her stem alone of all the bush.
And God, Who hears both sun-dried dust and sun,
Had pity, whispering to that luckless one,
"Sister, in that thou sayest We did not well --
What voices heardst thou when thy petals fell?"
And the Rose answered, "In that evil hour
A voice said, `Father, wherefore falls the flower?
For lo, the very gossamers are still.'
And a voice answered, `Son, by Allah's will!'"
 
RHYME a a *  
 
Then softly as a rain-mist on the sward,
Came to the Rose the Answer of the Lord:
"Sister, before We smote the dark in twain,
Ere yet the stars saw one another plain,
Time, Tide, and Space, We bound unto the task
That thou shouldst fall, and such an one should ask."
Whereat the withered flower, all content,
Died as they die whose days are innocent;
While he who questioned why the flower fell
Caught hold of God and saved his soul from Hell.

     Till I bring my broken rankers home again.
 
RHYME a b a b *  
 
In desire of many marvels over sea,
 Where the new-raised tropic city sweats and roars,
I have sailed with Young Ulysses from the quay
 Till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores.
He is blooded to the open and the sky,
 He is taken in a snare that shall not fail,
He shall hear me singing strongly, till he die,
 Like the shouting of a backstay in a gale.
    With my "~Hya!  Heeya!  Heeya!  Hullah!  Haul!~"
     [O the green that thunders aft along the deck!]
    Are you sick o' towns and men?  You must sign and sail again,
     For it's "Johnny Bowlegs, pack your kit and trek!"
 
RHYME a b a b *  
 
Through the gorge that gives the stars at noon-day clear --
 Up the pass that packs the scud beneath our wheel --
Round the bluff that sinks her thousand fathom sheer --
 Down the valley with our guttering brakes asqueal:
Where the trestle groans and quivers in the snow,
 Where the many-shedded levels loop and twine,
So I lead my reckless children from below
 Till we sing the Song of Roland to the pine.
    With my "~Tinka-tinka-tinka-tinka-tink!~"
     [And the axe has cleared the mountain, croup and crest!]
    So we ride the iron stallions down to drink,
     Through the ca]~nons to the waters of the West!
 
RHYME a b a b *  
 
And the tunes that mean so much to you alone --
 Common tunes that make you choke and blow your nose,
Vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan --
 I can rip your very heartstrings out with those;
With the feasting, and the folly, and the fun --
 And the lying, and the lusting, and the drink,
And the merry play that drops you, when you're done,
 To the thoughts that burn like irons if you think.
    With my "~Plunka-lunka-lunka-lunka-lunk!~"
     Here's a trifle on account of pleasure past,
    Ere the wit that made you win gives you eyes to see your sin
     And the heavier repentance at the last!
 
RHYME a b a b *  
 
Let the organ moan her sorrow to the roof --
 I have told the naked stars the Grief of Man!
Let the trumpets snare the foeman to the proof --
 I have known Defeat, and mocked it as we ran!
My bray ye may not alter nor mistake
 When I stand to jeer the fatted Soul of Things,
But the Song of Lost Endeavour that I make,
 Is it hidden in the twanging of the strings?
    With my "~Ta-ra-rara-rara-ra-ra-rrrp!~"
     [Is it naught to you that hear and pass me by?]
    But the word -- the word is mine, when the order moves the line
     And the lean, locked ranks go roaring down to die.
 
RHYME a b a b *  
 
Of the driven dust of speech I make a flame
 And a scourge of broken withes that men let fall:
For the words that had no honour till I came --
 Lo! I raise them into honour over all!
By the wisdom of the centuries I speak --
 To the tune of yestermorn I set the truth --
I, the joy of life unquestioned -- I, the Greek --
 I, the everlasting Wonder Song of Youth!
    With my "~Tinka-tinka-tinka-tinka-tink!~"
     [What d'ye lack, my noble masters?  What d'ye lack?]
    So I draw the world together link by link:
     Yea, from Delos up to Limerick and back!

The Man-o'-War's her husband, and he's always handy by,
But, oh, the little cargo-boats! they've got to load or die.

RHYME a a a 
 
The fear was on the cattle, for the gale was on the sea,
An' the pens broke up on the lower deck an' let the creatures free --
An' the lights went out on the lower deck, an' no one near but me.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
I had been singin' to them to keep 'em quiet there,
For the lower deck is the dangerousest, requirin' constant care,
An' give to me as the strongest man, though used to drink and swear.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
I see my chance was certain of bein' horned or trod,
For the lower deck was packed with steers thicker'n peas in a pod,
An' more pens broke at every roll -- so I made a Contract with God.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
An' by the terms of the Contract, as I have read the same,
If He got me to port alive I would exalt His Name,
An' praise His Holy Majesty till further orders came.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
He saved me from the cattle an' He saved me from the sea,
For they found me 'tween two drownded ones where the roll had landed me --
An' a four-inch crack on top of my head, as crazy as could be.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
But that were done by a stanchion, an' not by a bullock at all,
An' I lay still for seven weeks convalessing of the fall,
An' readin' the shiny Scripture texts in the Seaman's Hospital.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
An' I spoke to God of our Contract, an' He says to my prayer:
"I never puts on My ministers no more than they can bear.
So back you go to the cattle-boats an' preach My Gospel there.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
"For human life is chancy at any kind of trade,
But most of all, as well you know, when the steers are mad-afraid;
So you go back to the cattle-boats an' preach 'em as I've said.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
"They must quit drinkin' an' swearin', they mustn't knife on a blow,
They must quit gamblin' their wages, and you must preach it so;
For now those boats are more like Hell than anything else I know."
 
RHYME a a a 
 
I didn't want to do it, for I knew what I should get,
An' I wanted to preach Religion, handsome an' out of the wet,
But the Word of the Lord were lain on me, an' I done what I was set.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
I have been smit an' bruised, as warned would be the case,
An' turned my cheek to the smiter exactly as Scripture says;
But following that, I knocked him down an' led him up to Grace.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
An' we have preaching on Sundays whenever the sea is calm,
An' I use no knife or pistol an' I never take no harm,
For the Lord abideth back of me to guide my fighting arm.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
An' I sign for four-pound-ten a month and save the money clear,
An' I am in charge of the lower deck, an' I never lose a steer;
An' I believe in Almighty God an' preach His Gospel here.
 
RHYME a a a 
 
The skippers say I'm crazy, but I can prove 'em wrong,
For I am in charge of the lower deck with all that doth belong --
~Which they would not give to a lunatic, and the competition so strong!~

RHYME a b c b 
 
There dwells a wife by the Northern Gate,
 And a wealthy wife is she;
She breeds a breed o' rovin' men
 And casts them over sea.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
And some are drowned in deep water,
 And some in sight o' shore,
And word goes back to the weary wife
 And ever she sends more.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
For since that wife had gate or gear,
 Or hearth or garth or bield,
She willed her sons to the white harvest,
 And that is a bitter yield.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
She wills her sons to the wet ploughing,
 To ride the horse of tree,
And syne her sons come back again
 Far-spent from out the sea.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
The good wife's sons come home again
 With little into their hands,
But the lore of men that ha' dealt with men
 In the new and naked lands;
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
But the faith of men that ha' brothered men
 By more than easy breath,
And the eyes o' men that ha' read wi' men
 In the open books of death.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
Rich are they, rich in wonders seen,
 But poor in the goods o' men;
So what they ha' got by the skin o' their teeth
 They sell for their teeth again.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
For whether they lose to the naked life
 Or win to their hearts' desire,
They tell it all to the weary wife
 That nods beside the fire.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
Her hearth is wide to every wind
 That makes the white ash spin;
And tide and tide and 'tween the tides
 Her sons go out and in;
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
(Out with great mirth that do desire
 Hazard of trackless ways,
In with content to wait their watch
 And warm before the blaze);
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
And some return by failing light,
 And some in waking dream,
For she hears the heels of the dripping ghosts
 That ride the rough roof-beam.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
Home, they come home from all the ports,
 The living and the dead;
The good wife's sons come home again
 For her blessing on their head!

RHYME a b c b *  
 
The earth is full of anger,
 The seas are dark with wrath,
The Nations in their harness
 Go up against our path:
Ere yet we loose the legions --
 Ere yet we draw the blade,
Jehovah of the Thunders,
 Lord God of Battles, aid!
 
RHYME a b c b *  
 
High lust and froward bearing,
 Proud heart, rebellious brow --
Deaf ear and soul uncaring,
 We seek Thy mercy now!
The sinner that forswore Thee,
 The fool that passed Thee by,
Our times are known before Thee --
 Lord, grant us strength to die!
 
RHYME a b c b *  
 
For those who kneel beside us
 At altars not Thine own,
Who lack the lights that guide us,
 Lord, let their faith atone.
If wrong we did to call them,
 By honour bound they came;
Let not Thy Wrath befall them,
 But deal to us the blame.
 
RHYME a b c b *  
 
From panic, pride, and terror,
 Revenge that knows no rein,
Light haste and lawless error,
 Protect us yet again.
Cloak Thou our undeserving,
 Make firm the shuddering breath,
In silence and unswerving
 To taste Thy lesser death!
 
RHYME a b c b *  
 
Ah, Mary pierced with sorrow,
 Remember, reach and save
The soul that comes to-morrow
 Before the God that gave!
Since each was born of woman,
 For each at utter need --
True comrade and true foeman --
 Madonna, intercede!
 
RHYME a b c b *  
 
E'en now their vanguard gathers,
 E'en now we face the fray --
As Thou didst help our fathers,
 Help Thou our host to-day!
Fulfilled of signs and wonders,
 In life, in death made clear --
Jehovah of the Thunders,
 Lord God of Battles, hear!
 
TITLE 
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
     Thy face is far from this our war,
      Our call and counter-cry,
     I shall not find Thee quick and kind,
      Nor know Thee till I die,
     Enough for me in dreams to see
      And touch Thy garments' hem:
     Thy feet have trod so near to God
      I may not follow them.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
Through wantonness if men profess
 They weary of Thy parts,
E'en let them die at blasphemy
 And perish with their arts;
But we that love, but we that prove
 Thine excellence august,
While we adore discover more
 Thee perfect, wise, and just.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
Since spoken word Man's Spirit stirred
 Beyond his belly-need,
What is is Thine of fair design
 In thought and craft and deed;
Each stroke aright of toil and fight,
 That was and that shall be,
And hope too high, wherefore we die,
 Has birth and worth in Thee.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
Who holds by Thee hath Heaven in fee
 To gild his dross thereby,
And knowledge sure that he endure
 A child until he die --
For to make plain that man's disdain
 Is but new Beauty's birth --
For to possess in loneliness
 The joy of all the earth.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
As Thou didst teach all lovers speech
 And Life all mystery,
So shalt Thou rule by every school
 Till love and longing die,
Who wast or yet the Lights were set,
 A whisper in the Void,
Who shalt be sung through planets young
 When this is clean destroyed.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
Beyond the bounds our staring rounds,
 Across the pressing dark,
The children wise of outer skies
 Look hitherward and mark
A light that shifts, a glare that drifts,
 Rekindling thus and thus,
Not all forlorn, for Thou hast borne
 Strange tales to them of us.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
Time hath no tide but must abide
 The servant of Thy will;
Tide hath no time, for to Thy rhyme
 The ranging stars stand still --
Regent of spheres that lock our fears,
 Our hopes invisible,
Oh 'twas certes at Thy decrees
 We fashioned Heaven and Hell!
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
Pure Wisdom hath no certain path
 That lacks thy morning-eyne,
And captains bold by Thee controlled
 Most like to Gods design;
Thou art the Voice to kingly boys
 To lift them through the fight,
And Comfortress of Unsuccess,
 To give the dead good-night --
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
A veil to draw 'twixt God His Law
 And Man's infirmity,
A shadow kind to dumb and blind
 The shambles where we die;
A rule to trick th' arithmetic
 Too base of leaguing odds --
The spur of trust, the curb of lust,
 Thou handmaid of the Gods!
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
O Charity, all patiently
 Abiding wrack and scaith!
O Faith, that meets ten thousand cheats
 Yet drops no jot of faith!
Devil and brute Thou dost transmute
 To higher, lordlier show,
Who art in sooth that lovely Truth
 The careless angels know!
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
     Thy face is far from this our war,
      Our call and counter-cry,
     I may not find Thee quick and kind,
      Nor know Thee till I die.
 
RHYME a b c b * 
 
     Yet may I look with heart unshook
      On blow brought home or missed --
     Yet may I hear with equal ear
      The clarions down the List;
     Yet set my lance above mischance
      And ride the barriere --
     Oh, hit or miss, how little 'tis,
      My Lady is not there!

RHYME a b c b 
 
The King has called for priest and cup,
 The King has taken spur and blade
To dub True Thomas a belted knight,
 And all for the sake o' the songs he made.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
They have sought him high, they have sought him low,
 They have sought him over down and lea;
They have found him by the milk-white thorn
 That guards the gates o' Faerie.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
     'Twas bent beneath and blue above,
      Their eyes were held that they might not see
     The kine that grazed beneath the knowes,
      Oh, they were the Queens o' Faerie!
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Now cease your song," the King he said,
 "Oh, cease your song and get you dight
To vow your vow and watch your arms,
 For I will dub you a belted knight.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"For I will give you a horse o' pride,
 Wi' blazon and spur and page and squire;
Wi' keep and tail and seizin and law,
 And land to hold at your desire."
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
True Thomas smiled above his harp,
 And turned his face to the naked sky,
Where, blown before the wastrel wind,
 The thistle-down she floated by.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"I ha' vowed my vow in another place,
 And bitter oath it was on me,
I ha' watched my arms the lee-long night,
 Where five-score fighting men would flee.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"My lance is tipped o' the hammered flame,
 My shield is beat o' the moonlight cold;
And I won my spurs in the Middle World,
 A thousand fathom beneath the mould.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"And what should I make wi' a horse o' pride,
 And what should I make wi' a sword so brown,
But spill the rings o' the Gentle Folk
 And flyte my kin in the Fairy Town?
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"And what should I make wi' blazon and belt,
 Wi' keep and tail and seizin and fee,
And what should I do wi' page and squire
 That am a king in my own countrie?
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"For I send east and I send west,
 And I send far as my will may flee,
By dawn and dusk and the drinking rain,
 And syne my Sendings return to me.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"They come wi' news of the groanin' earth,
 They come wi' news o' the roarin' sea,
Wi' word of Spirit and Ghost and Flesh,
 And man, that's mazed among the three."
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
The King he bit his nether lip,
 And smote his hand upon his knee:
"By the faith o' my soul, True Thomas," he said,
 "Ye waste no wit in courtesie!
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"As I desire, unto my pride,
 Can I make Earls by three and three,
To run before and ride behind
 And serve the sons o' my body."
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"And what care I for your row-foot earls,
 Or all the sons o' your body?
Before they win to the Pride o' Name,
 I trow they all ask leave o' me.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"For I make Honour wi' muckle mouth,
 As I make Shame wi' mincin' feet,
To sing wi' the priests at the market-cross,
 Or run wi' the dogs in the naked street.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"And some they give me the good red gold,
 And some they give me the white money,
And some they give me a clout o' meal,
 For they be people o' low degree.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"And the song I sing for the counted gold
 The same I sing for the white money,
But best I sing for the clout o' meal
 That simple people given me."
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
The King cast down a silver groat,
 A silver groat o' Scots money,
"If I come wi' a poor man's dole," he said,
 "True Thomas, will ye harp to me?"
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Whenas I harp to the children small,
 They press me close on either hand.
And who are you," True Thomas said,
 "That you should ride while they must stand?
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Light down, light down from your horse o' pride,
 I trow ye talk too loud and hie,
And I will make you a triple word,
 And syne, if ye dare, ye shall 'noble me."
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
He has lighted down from his horse o' pride,
 And set his back against the stone.
"Now guard you well," True Thomas said,
 "Ere I rax your heart from your breast-bone!"
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
True Thomas played upon his harp,
 The fairy harp that couldna lee,
And the first least word the proud King heard,
 It harpit the salt tear out o' his ee.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Oh, I see the love that I lost long syne,
 I touch the hope that I may not see,
And all that I did o' hidden shame,
 Like little snakes they hiss at me.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"The sun is lost at noon -- at noon!
 The dread o' doom has grippit me.
True Thomas, hide me under your cloak,
 God wot, I'm little fit to dee!"
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
     'Twas bent beneath and blue above --
      'Twas open field and running flood --
     Where, hot on heath and dike and wall,
      The high sun warmed the adder's brood.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Lie down, lie down," True Thomas said.
 "The God shall judge when all is done.
But I will bring you a better word
 And lift the cloud that I laid on."
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
True Thomas played upon his harp,
 That birled and brattled to his hand,
And the next least word True Thomas made,
 It garred the King take horse and brand.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Oh, I hear the tread o' the fighting men,
 I see the sun on splent and spear.
I mark the arrow outen the fern
 That flies so low and sings so clear!
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Advance my standards to that war,
 And bid my good knights prick and ride;
The gled shall watch as fierce a fight
 As e'er was fought on the Border side!"
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
     'Twas bent beneath and blue above,
      'Twas nodding grass and naked sky,
     Where, ringing up the wastrel wind,
      The eyas stooped upon the pie.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
True Thomas sighed above his harp,
 And turned the song on the midmost string;
And the last least word True Thomas made,
 He harpit his dead youth back to the King.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Now I am prince, and I do well
 To love my love withouten fear;
To walk wi' man in fellowship,
 And breathe my horse behind the deer.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"My hounds they bay unto the death,
 The buck has couched beyond the burn,
My love she waits at her window
 To wash my hands when I return.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"For that I live am I content
 (Oh! I have seen my true love's eyes)
To stand wi' Adam in Eden-glade,
 And run in the woods o' Paradise!"
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
     'Twas naked sky and nodding grass,
      'Twas running flood and wastrel wind,
     Where, checked against the open pass,
      The red deer belled to call the hind.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
True Thomas laid his harp away,
 And louted low at the saddle-side;
He has taken stirrup and hauden rein,
 And set the King on his horse o' pride.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"Sleep ye or wake," True Thomas said,
 "That sit so still, that muse so long;
Sleep ye or wake? -- till the latter sleep
 I trow ye'll not forget my song.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"I ha' harpit a shadow out o' the sun
 To stand before your face and cry;
I ha' armed the earth beneath your heel,
 And over your head I ha' dusked the sky.
 
RHYME a b c b 
 
"I ha' harpit ye up to the throne o' God,
 I ha' harpit your midmost soul in three;
I ha' harpit ye down to the Hinges o' Hell,
 And -- ye -- would -- make -- a Knight o' me!"

RHYME a b c b  
 
In the Neolithic Age savage warfare did I wage
 For food and fame and woolly horses' pelt;
I was singer to my clan in that dim, red Dawn of Man,
 And I sang of all we fought and feared and felt.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Yea, I sang as now I sing, when the Prehistoric spring
 Made the piled Biscayan ice-pack split and shove;
And the troll and gnome and dwerg, and the Gods of Cliff and Berg
 Were about me and beneath me and above.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
But a rival, of Solutr]/e, told the tribe my style was ~outr]/e~ --
 'Neath a tomahawk of diorite he fell.
And I left my views on Art, barbed and tanged, below the heart
 Of a mammothistic etcher at Grenelle.

Then I stripped them, scalp from skull, and my hunting dogs fed full,
 And their teeth I threaded neatly on a thong;
And I wiped my mouth and said, "It is well that they are dead,
 For I know my work is right and theirs was wrong."
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
But my Totem saw the shame; from his ridgepole shrine he came,
 And he told me in a vision of the night: --
"There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,
 And every single one of them is right!"
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Then the silence closed upon me till They put new clothing on me
 Of whiter, weaker flesh and bone more frail;
And I stepped beneath Time's finger, once again a tribal singer
 [And a minor poet certified by Tr--ll].
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Still they skirmish to and fro, men my messmates on the snow,
 When we headed off the aurochs turn for turn;
When the rich Allobrogenses never kept amanuenses,
 And our only plots were piled in lakes at Berne.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Still a cultured Christian age sees us scuffle, squeak, and rage,
 Still we pinch and slap and jabber, scratch and dirk;
Still we let our business slide -- as we dropped the half-dressed hide --
 To show a fellow-savage how to work.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Still the world is wondrous large, -- seven seas from marge to marge, --
 And it holds a vast of various kinds of man;
And the wildest dreams of Kew are the facts of Khatmandhu,
 And the crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.
 
RHYME a b c b  
 
Here's my wisdom for your use, as I learned it when the moose
 And the reindeer roared where Paris roars to-night: --
There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays,
 And -- every -- single -- one -- of -- them -- is -- right!

RHYME a a * 
 
Once, on a glittering ice-field, ages and ages ago,
Ung, a maker of pictures, fashioned an image of snow.
Fashioned the form of a tribesman -- gaily he whistled and sung,
Working the snow with his fingers.  ~Read ye the Story of Ung!~
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Pleased was his tribe with that image -- came in their hundreds to scan --
Handled it, smelt it, and grunted:  "Verily, this is a man!
Thus do we carry our lances -- thus is a war-belt slung.
Lo! it is even as we are.  Glory and honour to Ung!"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Later he pictured an aurochs -- later he pictured a bear --
Pictured the sabre-tooth tiger dragging a man to his lair --
Pictured the mountainous mammoth, hairy, abhorrent, alone --
Out of the love that he bore them, scribing them clearly on bone.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Swift came the tribe to behold them, peering and pushing and still --
Men of the berg-battered beaches, men of the boulder-hatched hill --
Hunters and fishers and trappers, presently whispering low:
"Yea, they are like -- and it may be --  But how does the Picture-man know?"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"Ung -- hath he slept with the Aurochs -- watched where the Mastodon roam?
Spoke on the ice with the Bow-head -- followed the Sabre-tooth home?
Nay!  These are toys of his fancy!  If he have cheated us so,
How is there truth in his image -- the man that he fashioned of snow?"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Wroth was that maker of pictures -- hotly he answered the call:
"Hunters and fishers and trappers, children and fools are ye all!
Look at the beasts when ye hunt them!"  Swift from the tumult he broke,
Ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And the father of Ung gave answer, that was old and wise in the craft,
Maker of pictures aforetime, he leaned on his lance and laughed:
"If they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done,
And each man would make him a picture, and -- what would become of my son?
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"There would be no pelts of the reindeer, flung down at thy cave for a gift,
Nor dole of the oily timber that comes on the Baltic drift;
No store of well-drilled needles, nor ouches of amber pale;
No new-cut tongues of the bison, nor meat of the stranded whale.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"~Thou~ hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze,
Nor worked the war-boats outward through the rush of the rock-staked seas,
Yet they bring thee fish and plunder -- full meal and an easy bed --
And all for the sake of thy pictures."  And Ung held down his head.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"~Thou~ hast not stood to the Aurochs when the red snow reeks of the fight;
Men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright.
And the heart of the hairy Mammoth, thou sayest, they do not see,
Yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
"And now do they press to thy pictures, with opened mouth and eye,
And a little gift in the doorway, and the praise no gift can buy:
But -- sure they have doubted thy pictures, and that is a grievous stain --
Son that can see so clearly, return them their gifts again!"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And Ung looked down at his deerskins -- their broad shell-tasselled bands --
And Ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands;
And he gloved himself and departed, and he heard his father, behind:
"Son that can see so clearly, rejoice that thy tribe is blind!"
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Straight on the glittering ice-field, by the caves of the lost Dordogne,
Ung, a maker of pictures, fell to his scribing on bone
Even to mammoth editions.  Gaily he whistled and sung,
Blessing his tribe for their blindness.  ~Heed ye the Story of Ung!~

Full thirty foot she towered from waterline to rail.
It cost a watch to steer her, and a week to shorten sail;
But, spite all modern notions, I found her first and best --
The only certain packet for the Islands of the Blest.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Fair held the breeze behind us -- 'twas warm with lovers' prayers.
We'd stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs.
They shipped as Able Bastards till the Wicked Nurse confessed,
And they worked the old three-decker to the Islands of the Blest.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
By ways no gaze could follow, a course unspoiled of Cook,
Per Fancy, fleetest in man, our titled berths we took
With maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed,
And a Church of England parson for the Islands of the Blest.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
We asked no social questions -- we pumped no hidden shame --
We never talked obstetrics when the Little Stranger came:
We left the Lord in Heaven, we left the fiends in Hell.
We weren't exactly Yussufs, but -- Zuleika didn't tell.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
No moral doubt assailed us, so when the port we neared,
The villain had his flogging at the gangway, and we cheered.
'Twas fiddle in the forc's'le -- 'twas garlands on the mast,
For every one got married, and I went ashore at last.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
I left 'em all in couples a-kissing on the decks.
I left the lovers loving and the parents signing cheques.
In endless English comfort by county-folk caressed,
I left the old three-decker at the Islands of the Blest!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
That route is barred to steamers:  you'll never lift again
Our purple-painted headlands or the lordly keeps of Spain.
They're just beyond your skyline, howe'er so far you cruise
In a ram-you-damn-you liner with a brace of bucking screws.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Swing round your aching search-light -- 'twill show no haven's peace.
Ay, blow your shrieking sirens to the deaf, gray-bearded seas!
Boom out the dripping oil-bags to skin the deep's unrest --
And you aren't one knot the nearer to the Islands of the Blest!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
But when you're threshing, crippled, with broken bridge and rail,
At a drogue of dead convictions to hold you head to gale,
Calm as the Flying Dutchman, from truck to taffrail dressed,
You'll see the old three-decker for the Islands of the Blest.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
You'll see her tiering canvas in sheeted silver spread;
You'll hear the long-drawn thunder 'neath her leaping figure-head;
While far, so far above you, her tall poop-lanterns shine
Unvexed by wind or weather like the candles round a shrine!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Hull down -- hull down and under -- she dwindles to a speck,
With noise of pleasant music and dancing on her deck.
All's well -- all's well aboard her -- she's left you far behind,
With a scent of old-world roses through the fog that ties you blind.
 
RHYME a a * 
 
Her crew are babes or madmen?  Her port is all to make?
You're manned by Truth and Science, and you steam for steaming's sake?
Well, tinker up your engines -- you know your business best --
~She~'s taking tired people to the Islands of the Blest!

I've paid for your sickest fancies; I've humoured your crackedest whim --
Dick, it's your daddy, dying; you've got to listen to him!
Good for a fortnight, am I?  The doctor told you?  He lied.
I shall go under by morning, and --  Put that nurse outside.
'Never seen death yet, Dickie?  Well, now is your time to learn,
And you'll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn.
Not counting the Line and the Foundry, the yards and the village, too,
I've made myself and a million; but I'm damned if I made you.
Master at two-and-twenty, and married at twenty-three --
Ten thousand men on the pay-roll, and forty freighters at sea!
Fifty years between 'em, and every year of it fight,
And now I'm Sir Anthony Gloster, dying, a baronite:
For I lunched with his Royal HIghness -- what was it the papers a-had?
"Not least of our merchant-princes."  Dickie, that's me, your dad!
~I~ didn't begin with askings.  ~I~ took my job and I stuck;
And I took the chances they wouldn't, an' now they're calling it luck.
Lord, what boats I've handled -- rotten and leaky and old!
Ran 'em, or -- opened the bilge-cock, precisely as I was told.

RHYME a a *
 
Grub that hud bind you crazy, and crews that hud turn you grey,
And a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way.
The others they dursn't do it; they said they valued their life
(They've served me since as skippers).  ~I~ went, and I took my wife.
Over the world I drove 'em, married at twenty-three,
And your mother saving the money and making a man of me.
~I~ was content to be master, but she said there was better behind;
She took the chances I wouldn't, and I followed your mother blind.
She egged me to borrow the money, an' she helped me to clear the loan,
When we bought half shares in a cheap hun and hoisted a flag of our own.
Patching and coaling on credit, and living the Lord knew how,
We started the Red Ox freighters -- we've eight-and-thirty now.

RHYME a a *
 
And those were the days of clippers, and the freights were clipper-freights,
And we knew we were making our fortune, but she died in Macassar Straits --
By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank --
And we dropped her in fourteen fathom; I pricked it off where she sank.
Owners we were, full owners, and the boat was christened for her,
And she died in the ~Mary Gloster~.  My heart, how young we were!
So I went on a spree round Java and well-nigh ran her ashore,
But your mother came and warned me and I wouldn't liquor no more:
Strict I stuck to my business, afraid to stop or I'd think,
Saving the money (she warned me), and letting the other men drink.
And I met M'Cullough in London (I'd turned five hundred then),
And 'tween us we started the Foundry -- three forges and twenty men:
Cheap repairs for the cheap huns.  It paid, and the business grew,
For I bought me a steam-lathe patent, and that was a gold mine too.
"Cheaper to build 'em than buy 'em," ~I~ said, but M'Cullough he shied,
And we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the Clyde.

RHYME a a *
 
And the Lines were all beginning, and we all of us started fair,
Building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square.
But M'Cullough he wanted cabins with marble and maple and all,
And Brussels an' Utrecht velvet, and baths and a Social Hall,
And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames too light,
But M'Cullough he died in the Sixties, and --  Well, I'm dying to-night. . . .
I knew -- ~I~ knew what was coming, when we bid on the ~Byfleet~'s keel --
They piddled and piffled with iron:  I'd given my orders for steel!
Steel and the first expansions.  It paid, I tell you, it paid,
When we came with our nine-knot freighters and collared the long-run trade!
And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture text,
"You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the next!"
They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't copy my mind,
And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind.

RHYME a a *
 
Then came the armour-contracts, but that was M'Cullough's side;
He was always best in the Foundry, but better, perhaps, he died.
I went through his private papers; the notes was plainer than print;
And I'm no fool to finish if a man'll give me a hint.
(I remember his widow was angry.)  So I saw what the drawings meant,
And I started the six-inch rollers, and it paid me sixty per cent --
Sixty per cent ~with~ failures, and more than twice we could do,
And a quarter-million to credit, and I saved it all for you!
I thought -- it doesn't matter -- you seemed to favour your ma,
But you're nearer forty than thirty, and I know the kind you are.

RHYME a a *
 
Harrer an' Trinity College!  I ought to ha' sent you to sea --
But I stood you an education, an' what have you done for me?
The things I knew was proper you wouldn't thank me to give,
And the things I knew was rotten you said was the way to live.
For you muddled with books and pictures, an' china an' etchin's an' fans,
And your rooms at college was beastly -- more like a whore's than a man's --
Till you married that thin-flanked woman, as white and as stale as a bone,
An' she gave you your social nonsense; but where's that kid o' your own?
I've seen your carriages blocking the half o' the Cromwell Road,
But never the doctor's brougham to help the missus unload.

RHYME a a *
 
(So there isn't even a grandchild, an' the Gloster family's done.)
Not like your mother, she isn't.  ~She~ carried her freight each run.
But they died, the pore little beggars!  At sea she had 'em -- they died.
Only you, an' you stood it; you haven't stood much beside.
Weak, a liar, and idle, and mean as a collier's whelp
Nosing for scraps in the galley.  No help -- my son was no help!
So he gets three hundred thousand, in trust and the interest paid.
I wouldn't give it you, Dickie -- you see, I made it in trade.
You're saved from soiling your fingers, and if you have no child,
It all comes back to the business.  Gad, won't your wife be wild!
'Calls and calls in her carriage, her handkerchief up to her eye:
"Daddy! dear daddy's dyin'!" and doing her best to cry.
Grateful?  Oh, yes, I'm grateful, but keep her away from here.
Your mother hud never ha' stood 'er, and, anyhow, women are queer. . . .

RHYME a a *
 
There's women will say I've married a second time.Not quite!  
But give pore Aggie a hundred, and tell her your lawyers'll fight.
She was the best o' the boiling -- you'll meet her before it ends;
I'm in for a row with the mother -- I'll leave you settle my friends:
For a man he must go with a woman, which women don't understand --
Or the sort that say they can see it they aren't the marrying brand.
But I wanted to speak o' your mother that's Lady Gloster still --
I'm going to up and see her, without it's hurting the will.
Here!  Take your hand off the bell-pull.  Five thousand's waiting for you,
If you'll only listen a minute, and do as I bid you do.
They'll try to prove me crazy, and, if you bungle, they can;
And I've only you to trust to!  (O God, why ain't he a man?)

RHYME a a *
 
There's some waste money on marbles, the same as M'Cullough tried --
Marbles and mausoleums -- but I call that sinful pride.
There's some ship bodies for burial -- we've carried 'em, soldered and packed;
Down in their wills they wrote it, and nobody called ~them~ cracked.
But me -- I've too much money, and people might. . . .  All my fault:
It come o' hoping for grandsons and buying that Wokin' vault.
I'm sick o' the whole dam' business; I'm going back where I came.
Dick, you're the son o' my body, and you'll take charge o' the same!
I want to lie by your mother, ten thousand mile away,
And they'll want to send me to Woking; and that's where you'll earn your pay.
I've thought it out on the quiet, the same as it ought to be done --
Quiet, and decent, and proper -- an' here's your orders, my son.

RHYME a a *
 
You know the Line?  You don't, though.  You write to the Board, and tell
Your father's death has upset you an' you're goin' to cruise for a spell,
An' you'd like the ~Mary Gloster~ -- I've held her ready for this --
They'll put her in working order and you'll take her out as she is.
Yes, it was money idle when I patched her and put her aside
(Thank God, I can pay for my fancies!) -- the boat where your mother died,
By the Little Paternosters, as you come to the Union Bank,
We dropped her -- I think I told you -- and I pricked it off where she sank --
['Tiny she looked on the grating -- that oily, treacly sea --]
'Hundred and eighteen East, remember, and South just three.

RHYME a a *
 
Easy bearings to carry -- three South -- three to the dot;
But I gave MHAndrew a copy in case of dying -- or not.
And so you'll write to MHAndrew, he's Chief of the Maori Line;
They'll give him leave, if you ask 'em and say it's business o' mine.
I built three boats for the Maoris, an' very well pleased they were,
An' I've known Mac since the Fifties, and Mac knew me -- and her.
After the first stroke warned me I sent him the money to keep
Against the time you'd claim it, committin' your dad to the deep;

RHYME a a *
 
For you are the son o' my body, and Mac was my oldest friend,
I've never asked him to dinner, but he'll see it out to the end.
Stiff-necked Glasgow beggar, I've heard he's prayed for my soul,
But he couldn't lie if you paid him, and he'd starve before he stole!
He'll take the ~Mary~ in ballast -- you'll find her a lively ship;
And you'll take Sir Anthony Gloster, that goes on his wedding-trip,
Lashed in our old deck-cabin with all three port-holes wide,
The kick o' the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside!
Sir Anthony Gloster's carriage -- our house-flag flyin' free --
Ten thousand men on the pay-roll and forty freighters at sea!

RHYME a a *
 
He made himself and a million, but this world is a fleetin' show,
And he'll go to the wife of his bosom the same as he ought to go --
By the heel of the Paternosters -- there isn't a chance to mistake --
And Mac'll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break!
Five thousand for six weeks' cruising, the staunchest freighter afloat,
And Mac he'll give you your bonus the minute I'm out o' the boat!
He'll take you round to Macassar, and you'll come back alone;
He knows what I want o' the ~Mary~. . . .  I'll do what I please with my own.
Your mother hud call it wasteful, but I've seven-and-thirty more;
I'll come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door. . . .
For my son he was never a credit:  he muddled with books and art,
And he lived on Sir Anthony's money and he broke Sir Anthony's heart.
There isn't even a grandchild, and the Gloster family's done --
The only one you left me, O mother, the only one!

RHYME a a *
 
Harrer and Trinity College -- me slavin' early an' late --
An' he thinks I'm dying crazy, and you're in Macassar Strait!
Flesh o' my flesh, my dearie, for ever an' ever amen,
That first stroke come for a warning; I ought to ha' gone to you then,
But -- cheap repairs for a cheap hun -- the doctors said I'd do:
Mary, why didn't ~you~ warn me?  I've allus heeded to you,
Excep' -- I know -- about women; but you are a spirit now;
An', wife, they was only women, and I was a man.  That's how.
An' a man he must go with a woman, as you could not understand;
But I never talked 'em secrets.  I paid 'em out o' hand.

RHYME a a *
 
Thank Gawd, I can pay for my fancies!  Now what's five thousand to me,
For a berth off the Paternosters in the haven where I would be?
~I~ believe in the Resurrection, if I read my Bible plain,
But I wouldn't trust 'em at Wokin'; we're safer at sea again.
For the heart it shall go with the treasure -- go down to the sea in ships.
I'm sick of the hired women -- I'll kiss my girl on her lips!
I'll be content with my fountain, I'll drink from my own well,
And the wife of my youth shall charm me -- an' the rest can go to Hell!
(Dickie, ~he~ will, that's certain.)  I'll lie in our standin'-bed,
An' Mac'll take her in ballast -- an' she trims best by the head. . . .
Down by the head an' sinkin', her fires are drawn and cold,
And the water's splashin' hollow on the skin of the empty hold --
Churning an' choking and chuckling, quiet and scummy and dark --
Full to her lower hatches and risin' steady.  Hark!
That was the after-bulkhead. . . .  She's flooded from stem to stern. . . .
Never seen death yet, Dickie? . . .  Well, now is your time to learn!

RHYME a a b b 

Since August, when it started, it's been stickin' to our tail,
Though they've had us out by marches an' they've had us back by rail;

An' the sick-list to the Colonel makes ten more to-day.
 
RHYME a a b b 

There ain't no fun in women nor there ain't no bite to drink;
It's much too wet for shootin', we can only march and think;

"Get up, you rotten beggars, you've ten more to-day!"

'Twould make a monkey cough to see our way o' doin' things --
Lieutenants takin' companies an' captains takin' wings,

RHYME a a b b 

Our Colonel's white an' twitterly -- he gets no sleep nor food,
But mucks about in 'orspital where nothing does no good.
HE sends us heaps o' comforts, all bought from his pay --
But there aren't much comfort handy on ten deaths a day.
 
RHYME a a b b 

Our Chaplain's got a banjo, an' a skinny mule he rides,
An' the stuff he says an' sings us, Lord, it makes us split our sides!
With his black coat-tails a-bobbin' to ~Ta-ra-ra Boomderay!~
he's the proper kind o' ~padre~ for ten deaths a day.
 
RHYME a a b b 

An' Father Victor helps him with our Roman Catholicks --
He knows an heap of Irish songs an' rummy conjurin' tricks;
An' the two they works together when it comes to play or pray;
So we keep the ball a-rollin' on ten deaths a day.
 
RHYME a a b b 

We've got the cholerer in camp -- we've got it hot an' sweet;
It ain't no Christmas dinner, but it's helped an' we must eat.
We've gone beyond the funkin', 'cause we've found it doesn't pay,
An' we're rockin' round the Districk on ten deaths a day!

    An' them that do not like it they can lump it,
    An' them that cannot stand it they can jump it;
    We've got to die somewhere � some way � some'ow �
    We might as well begin to do it now!
    Then, Number One, let down the tent-pole slow,
    Knock out the pegs an' 'old the corners � so!
    Fold in the flies, furl up the ropes, an' stow!
    Oh, strike � oh, strike your camp an' go!

 Gettin' down an' shovin' in the sun;
An' you might have called us dirty, an' you might ha' called us dry,
 An' you might have heard us talkin' at the gun.
But the Captain had his jacket, an' the jacket it was new --
 (horse Gunners, listen to my song!)
An' the wettin' of the jacket is the proper thing to do,
 Nor we didn't keep him waitin' very long.

One day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt,
 Loadin' down the axle-arms with case;
But the Captain knew his dooty, an' he took the crackers out
 An' he put some proper liquor in its place.
An' the Captain saw the shrapnel, which is six-an'-thirty clear.

"Will you draw the weight," sez he, "or will you draw the beer?"
 An' we didn't keep him waitin' very long.
 
RHYME a b a b * 
 
Then we trotted gentle, not to break the bloomin' glass,
 Though the Arabites had all their ranges marked;
But we dursn't hardly gallop, for the most was bottled Bass,
 An' we'd dreamed of it since we was disembarked:
So we fired economic with the shells we had in hand,
 (horse Gunners, listen to my song!)
But the beggars under cover had the impidence to stand,
 An' we couldn't keep 'em waitin' very long.
 
RHYME a b a b * 
 
So we finished harf the liquor (an' the Captain took champagne),
 An' the Arabites was shootin' all the while;
An' we left our wounded happy with the empties on the plain,
 An' we used the bloomin' guns for pro-jec-tile!
We limbered up an' galloped -- there were nothin' else to do --

An' the Battery came a-boundin' like a boundin' kangaroo,
 But they didn't watch us comin' very long.

We was goin' most extended -- we was drivin' very fine,
 An' the Arabites were loosin' high an' wide,
Till the Captain took the glassy with a rattlin' right incline,
 An' we dropped upon their heads the other side.
Then we give 'em quarter -- such as hadn't up and cut,
 (horse Gunners, listen to my song!)
An' the Captain stood a limberful of fizzy -- somethin' Brutt,
 But we didn't leave it fizzing very long.
 
RHYME a b a b 
 
We might ha' been court-martialled, but it all come out all right
 When they signalled us to join the main command.

But you ought to have heard 'em markin' time

There was just nine hundred rank an' file
 To swear to a touch o' sun.
There was me he'd kissed in the sentry-box,
 As I have not told in my song,
But I took my oath, which were Bible truth,
 I hadn't seen nothin' wrong.

There's them that's hot an' haughty,
 There's them that's cold an' hard,
But there comes a night when the best gets tight,
 And then turns out the Guard.
I've seen them hide their liquor
 In every kind o' way,
But most depends on makin' friends
 With Privit Thomas A.!

You call yourself a man,
 For all you used to swear,
An' leave me, as you can,
 My certain shame to bear?
 I hear!  You do not care --
You done the worst you know.
 I hate you, grinnin' there. . . .
Ah, Gawd, I love you so!
 
RHYME a a b b

     Nice while it lasted, an' now it is over --
     Tear out your heart an' good-bye to your lover!
     What's the use o' grievin', when the mother that bore you
     (Mary, pity women!) knew it all before you?
 
RHYME a b a b b c b c

It aren't no false alarm,
 The finish to your fun;
You -- you have brung the harm,
 An' I'm the ruined one;
 An' now you'll off an' run
With some new fool in tow.
 Your heart?  You haven't none. . . .
Ah, Gawd, I love you so!
 
RHYME a a b b

     When a man is tired there is naught will bind him;
     All he solemn promised he will shove behind him.
     What's the good o' prayin' for The Wrath to strike him
     (Mary, pity women!), when the rest are like him?
 
RHYME a b a b b c b c 

What hope for me or -- it?
 What's left for us to do?
I've walked with men a bit,
 But this -- but this is you.
So help me Christ, it's true!
 Where can I hide or go?
You coward through and through! . . .
Ah, Gawd, I love you so!

RHYME a a b b

      All the more you give 'em the less are they for givin' --
     Love lies dead, an' you cannot kiss him livin'.
     Down the road he led you there is no returnin'
     (Mary, pity women!), but you're late in learnin'!
 
RHYME a b a b b c b c 

You'd like to treat me fair?
 You can't, because we're pore?
We'd starve?  What do I care!
 We might, but ~this~ is shore!
 I want the name -- no more --
The name, an' lines to show,
 An' not to be an whore. . . .
Ah, Gawd, I love you so!

RHYME a a b b

      What's the good o' pleadin', when the mother that bore you

The Injian Ocean sets an' smiles
 So sof', so bright, so bloomin' blue;
There aren't a wave for miles an' miles
 Excep' the jiggle from the screw.
The ship is swep', the day is done,
 The bugle's gone for smoke and play;
An' black agin' the settin' sun
 The Lascar sings, "~Hum deckty hai!~"
 
RHYME a b a b 

     For to admire an' for to see,
      For to behold this world so wide --

RHYME a b c b *

I see the sergeants pitchin' quoits,
 I hear the women laugh an' talk,
I spy upon the quarter-deck
 The orficers an' lydies walk.
I thinks about the things that was,
 An' leans an' looks acrost the sea,
Till spite of all the crowded ship
 There's no one lef' alive but me.
 
RHYME a b c b *

The things that was which I have seen,
 In barrick, camp, an' action too,
I tells them over by myself,
 An' sometimes wonders if they're true;
For they was odd -- most awful odd --
 But all the same now they are o'er,
There must be heaps o' plenty such,
 An' if I wait I'll see some more.
 
RHYME a b c b *

Oh, I have come upon the books,
 An' frequent broke a barrick rule,
An' stood beside an' watched myself
 Behavin' like a bloomin' fool.
I paid my price for findin' out,
 Nor never grutched the price I paid,
But sat in Clink without my boots,
 Admirin' how the world was made.
 
RHYME a b c b *

Behold a crowd upon the beam,
 An' humped above the sea appears
Old Aden, like a barrick-stove
 That no one's lit for years an' years!
I passed by that when I began,
 An' I go home the road I came,
A time-expired soldier-man
 With six years' service to his name.
 
RHYME a b c b *

My girl she said, "Oh, stay with me!"
 My mother held me to her breast.
They've never written none, an' so
 They must have gone with all the rest --
With all the rest which I have seen
 An' found an' known an' met along.
I cannot say the things I feel,
 And so I sing my evenin' song:
 
TITLE

RHYME a a * 
 
When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,
When the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died,
We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an ]aeon or two,
Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And those that were good shall be happy:  they shall sit in a golden chair;
They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair;
They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;
They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!
 
RHYME a a * 
 
And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;
And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,
But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,
Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of Things as They Are!

RHYME a b a b c c

If, drunk with sight of power, we loose

Such boastings as the Gentiles use,

Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget--lest we forget!

RHYME a b a b c c

For heathen heart that puts her trust
  In reeking tube and iron shard--
All valiant dust that builds on dust,

For frantic boast and foolish word,
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!

A fool there was and he made his prayer

To a rag and a bone and a hank of hair

But the fool he called her his lady fair
  (Even as you and I!)

Oh the years we waste and the tears we waste
  And the work of our head and hand,
Belong to the woman who did not know

RHYME a b a a a b 

A fool there was and his goods he spent

Honor and faith and a sure intent
But a fool must follow his natural bent

  (Even as you and I!)

RHYME a b c c b 

Oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost
  And the excellent things we planned,
Belong to the woman who didn't know why

RHYME a b a a a b 

The fool we stripped to his foolish hide
  (Even as you and I!)
Which she might have seen when she threw him aside--
(But it isn't on record the lady tried)
So some of him lived but the most of him died--
  (Even as you and I!)

RHYME a b c c b 

And it isn't the shame and it isn't the blame
  That stings like a white hot brand.
It's coming to know that she never knew why
(Seeing at last she could never know why)
  And never could understand.

Will you conquer my heart with your beauty; my soul going out from afar?
Shall I fall to your hand as a victim of crafty and cautious shikar?

Shall I meet you next session at Simla, O sweetest and best of your kind?

Does the P. and O. bear you to meward, or, clad in short frocks in the West,
Are you growing the charms that shall capture and torture the heart in my breast?

Will you stay in the Plains till September--my passion as warm as the day?
Will you bring me to book on the Mountains, or where the thermantidotes play?

When the light of your eyes shall make pallid the mean lesser lights I pursue,
And the charm of your presence shall lure me from love of the gay "thirteen-two";

When the peg and the pig-skin shall please not; when I buy me Calcutta-build clothes;
When I quit the Delight of Wild Asses; forswearing the swearing of oaths ;

As a deer to the hand of the hunter when I turn 'mid the gibes of my friends;
When the days of my freedom are numbered, and the life of the bachelor ends.

RHYME a a

Ah, Goddess! child, spinster, or widow--as of old on Mars Hill whey they raised
To the God that they knew not an altar--so I, a young Pagan, have praised

The Goddess I know not nor worship; yet, if half that men tell me be true,
You will come in the future, and therefore these verses are written to you.

Retrenchment.  If my promises can bring

Indeed, indeed, Retrenchment oft before

RHYME a a b a 

"Who hath not Prudence"--what was it I said,
Of Her who paints her Eyes and tires Her Head,

And fawns upon them for Her thriftless Bread?

Accursed is She of Eve's daughters--She
Hath cast off Prudence, and Her End shall be

Some portion of your daily Bread to Me.

I had seen, as the dawn was breaking
  And I staggered to my rest,
Tari Devi softly shaking
  From the Cart Road to the crest.
I had seen the spurs of Jakko
  Heave and quiver, swell and sink.
Was it Earthquake or tobacco,
  Day of Doom, or Night of Drink?

RHYME a b a b *

In the full, fresh fragrant morning
  I observed a camel crawl,
Laws of gravitation scorning,
  On the ceiling and the wall;
Then I watched a fender walking,
  And I heard grey leeches sing,
And a red-hot monkey talking
  Did not seem the proper thing.

RHYME a b a b *

Then a Creature, skinned and crimson,
  Ran about the floor and cried,
And they said that I had the "jims" on,
  And they dosed me with bromide,
And they locked me in my bedroom--
  Me and one wee Blood Red Mouse--
Though I said: "To give my head room
  You had best unroof the house."

RHYME a b a b *

But my words were all unheeded,
  Though I told the grave M.D.
That the treatment really needed
  Was a dip in open sea
That was lapping just below me,
  Smooth as silver, white as snow,
And it took three men to throw me
  When I found I could not go.

RHYME a b a b *

Half the night I watched the Heavens
  Fizz like 'h a  champagne--
Fly to sixes and to sevens,
  Wheel and thunder back again;
And when all was peace and order
  Save one planet nailed askew,
Much I wept because my warder
  Would not let me set it true.

RHYME a b a b *

After frenzied hours of waiting,
  When the Earth and Skies were dumb,
Pealed an awful voice dictating
  An interminable sum,
Changing to a tangle story--
  "What she said you said I said"--
Till the Moon arose in glory,
  And I found her . . . in my head;

RHYME a b a b *

Then a Face came, blind and weeping,
  And It couldn't wipe its eyes,
And It muttered I was keeping
  Back the moonlight from the skies;
So I patted it for pity,
  But it whistled shrill with wrath,
And a huge black Devil City
  Poured its peoples on my path.

RHYME a b a b *

So I fled with steps uncertain
  On a thousand-year long race,
But the bellying of the curtain
  Kept me always in one place;
While the tumult rose and maddened
  To the roar of Earth on fire,
Ere it ebbed and sank and saddened
  To a whisper tense as wire.

RHYME a b a b *

In tolerable stillness
  Rose one little, little star,
And it chuckled at my illness,
  And it mocked me from afar;
And its brethren came and eyed me,
  Called the Universe to aid,
Till I lay, with naught to hide me,
  'Neath the Scorn of All Things Made.

RHYME a b a b *

Dun and saffron, robed and splendid,
  Broke the solemn, pitying Day,
And I knew my pains were ended,
  And I turned and tried to pray;
But my speech was shattered wholly,
  And I wept as children weep.
Till the dawn-wind, softly, slowly,
  Brought to burning eyelids sleep.

  My color comes and goes;
I redden to my finger-tips,

The blush that flies at seventeen

I wish I had Her constant cheek;

All sorts of funny little songs,
  Not quite the proper thing.

  Her jokes aren't in my line;
And, worst of all, I'm seventeen

  Each pink and white and neat,
She's older than their mothers, but

She rides with half a dozen men,

I trot along the Mall alone;

Don't help to fill my programme-card,

From ten to two A.M. Ah me!
  Would I were forty-nine!

RHYME a b c b

She calls me "darling," "pet," and "dear,"
  And "sweet retiring maid."
I'm always at the back, I know,
  She puts me in the shade.

She introduces me to men,
  "Cast" lovers, I opine,
For sixty takes to seventeen,

  And end Her dancing days,
She can't go on forever so
  At concerts, balls and plays.

  Before my footsteps shine;
Just think, that She'll be eighty-one
  When I am forty-nine.

It was an artless Bandar, and he danced upon a pine,
And much I wondered how he lived, and where the beast might dine,
And many, many other things, till, o'er my morning smoke,
I slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that Bandar spoke.

RHYME a a *

He said: "O man of many clothes! Sad crawler on the Hills!
Observe, I know not Ranken's shop, nor Ranken's monthly bills;
I take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress;
Nor am I plagued with little cards for little drinks at Mess.

"I steal the bunnia's grain at morn, at noon and eventide,
(For he is fat and I am spare), I roam the mountain side,
I follow no man's carriage, and no, never in my life
Have I flirted at Peliti's with another Bandar's wife.

RHYME a a *

"O man of futile fopperies--unnecessary wraps;
I own no ponies in the hills, I drive no tall-wheeled traps;
I buy me not twelve-button gloves, 'short-sixes' eke, or rings,
Nor do I waste at Hamilton's my wealth on 'pretty things.'

RHYME a a *

"I quarrel with my wife at home, we never fight abroad;
But Mrs. B. has grasped the fact I am her only lord.
I never heard of fever--dumps nor debts depress my soul;
And I pity and despise you!" Here he poached my breakfast-roll.

RHYME a a *

His hide was very mangy, and his face was very red,
And ever and anon he scratched with energy his head.
His manners were not always nice, but how my spirit cried
To be an artless Bandar loose upon the mountain side!

RHYME a a *

So I answered: "Gentle Bandar, an inscrutable Decree
Makes thee a gleesome fleasome Thou, and me a wretched Me.
Go! Depart in peace, my brother, to thy home amid the pine;
Yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine."

        Railways and roads they wrought,

        His speech is of mortgaged bedding,

        He eats and hath indigestion,

TITLE

RHYME a b a b c c

Jane Austen Beecher Stowe de Rouse
  Was good beyond all earthly need;
But, on the other hand, her spouse
  Was very, very bad indeed.
He smoked cigars, called churches slow,
And raced--but this she did not know.

RHYME a b a b c c 

For Belial Machiavelli kept
  The little fact a secret, and,
Though o'er his minor sins she wept,
  Jane Austen did not understand
That Lilly--thirteen-two and bay
Absorbed one-half her husband's pay.

RHYME a b a b c c 

She was so good, she made him worse;
  (Some women are like this, I think;)
He taught her parrot how to curse,
  Her Assam monkey how to drink.
He vexed her righteous soul until
She went up, and he went down hill.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Then came the crisis, strange to say,
  Which turned a good wife to a better.
A telegraphic peon, one day,
  Brought her--now, had it been a letter
For Belial Machiavelli, I
Know Jane would just have let it lie.

RHYME a b a b c c 

But 'twas a telegram instead,
  Marked "urgent," and her duty plain
To open it. Jane Austen read:
  "Your Lilly's got a cough again.
Can't understand why she is kept
At your expense." Jane Austen wept.

RHYME a b a b c c 

It was a misdirected wire.
  Her husband was at Shaitanpore.
She spread her anger, hot as fire,
  Through six thin foreign sheets or more.
Sent off that letter, wrote another
To her solicitor--and mother.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Then Belial Machiavelli saw
  Her error and, I trust, his own,
Wired to the minion of the Law,
  And traveled wifeward--not alone.
For Lilly--thirteen-two and bay--
Came in a horse-box all the way.

RHYME a b a b c c 

There was a scene--a weep or two--
  With many kisses. Austen Jane
Rode Lilly all the season through,
  And never opened wires again.
She races now with Belial. This
Is very sad, but so it is.

Ay, lay him 'neath the Simla pine--
  A fortnight fully to be missed,
  Behold, we lose our fourth at whist,
A chair is vacant where we dine.

RHYME a b b a 

His place forgets him; other men
  Have bought his ponies, guns, and traps.
  His fortune is the Great Perhaps
And that cool rest-house down the glen,

RHYME a b b a 

Whence he shall hear, as spirits may,
  Our mundane revel on the height,
  Shall watch each flashing 'rickshaw-light
Sweep on to dinner, dance, and play.

RHYME a b b a 

Benmore shall woo him to the ball
  With lighted rooms and braying band;
  And he shall hear and understand
"Dream Faces" better than us all.

RHYME a b b a 

For, think you, as the vapours flee
  Across Sanjaolie after rain,
  His soul may climb the hill again
To each field of victory.

RHYME a b b a 

Unseen, who women held so dear,
  The strong man's yearning to his kind
  Shall shake at most the window-blind,
Or dull awhile the card-room's cheer.

RHYME a b b a 

In his own place of power unknown,
  His Light o' Love another's flame,
His dearest pony galloped lame,
And he an alien and alone!

RHYME a b b a 

Yet may he meet with many a friend--
  Shrewd shadows, lingering long unseen
  Among us when "God save the Queen"
Shows even "extras" have an end.

RHYME a b b a 

And, when we leave the heated room,
  And, when at four the lights expire,
  The crew shall gather round the fire
And mock our laughter in the gloom;

RHYME a b b a 

Talk as we talked, and they ere death--
  Flirt wanly, dance in ghostly-wise,
  With ghosts of tunes for melodies,
And vanish at the morning's breath.

RHYME a b a b 

Dim dawn behind the tamarisks--the sky is saffron-yellow--
  As the women in the village grind the corn,
And the parrots seek the riverside, each calling to his fellow
  That the Day, the staring Easter Day is born.

RHYME a b a b 

    Oh the white dust on the highway! Oh the stenches in the byway!
      Oh the clammy fog that hovers o'er the earth;
    And at Home they're making merry 'neath the white and scarlet berry--
      What part have India's exiles in their mirth?

RHYME a b a b 

Full day behind the tamarisks--the sky is blue and staring--
  As the cattle crawl afield beneath the yoke,
And they bear One o'er the field-path, who is past all hope or caring,
  To the ghat below the curling wreaths of smoke.

RHYME a b a b 

    Call on Rama, going slowly, as ye bear a brother lowly--
      Call on Rama--he may hear, perhaps, your voice!
    With our hymn-books and our psalters we appeal to other altars,
      And today we bid "good Christian men rejoice!"

RHYME a b a b 

High noon behind the tamarisks--the sun is hot above us--
  As at Home the Christmas Day is breaking wan.
They will drink our healths at dinner--those who tell us how they love us,
  And forget us till another year be gone!

RHYME a b c c b 

    Oh the toil that knows no breaking! Oh the Heimweh, ceaseless, aching!
      Oh the black dividing Sea and alien Plain!
    Youth was cheap--wherefore we sold it.
      Gold was good--we hoped to hold it,
    And today we know the fulness of our gain.

RHYME a b a b 

Grey dusk behind the tamarisks--the parrots fly together--
  As the sun is sinking slowly over Home;
And his last ray seems to mock us shackled in a lifelong tether.
  That drags us back howe'er so far we roam.

RHYME a b c b 

    Hard her service, poor her payment--she is ancient, tattered raiment--
      India, she the grim Stepmother of our kind.
    If a year of life be lent her, if her temple's shrine we enter,
      The door is shut--we may not look behind.

RHYME a b a b 

Black night behind the tamarisks--the owls begin their chorus--
  As the conches from the temple scream and bray.
With the fruitless years behind us, and the hopeless years before us,
  Let us honor, O my brother, Christmas Day!

RHYME a b c b 

    Call a truce, then, to our labors--let us feast with friends and neighbors,
      And be merry as the custom of our caste;
    For if "faint and forced the laughter," and if sadness follow after,
      We are richer by one mocking Christmas past.

RHYME a a *

Pagett, M.P., was a liar, and a fluent liar therewith--
He spoke of the heat of India as the "Asian Solar Myth";
Came on a four months' visit, to "study the East," in November,
And I got him to sign an agreement vowing to stay till September.

RHYME a a *

March came in with the koil. Pagett was cool and gay,
Called me a "bloated Brahmin," talked of my "princely pay."
March went out with the roses. "Where is your heat?" said he.
"Coming," said I to Pagett, "Skittles!" said Pagett, M.P.

RHYME a a *

April began with the punkah, coolies, and prickly-heat,--
Pagett was dear to mosquitoes, sandflies found him a treat.
He grew speckled and mumpy--hammered, I grieve to say,
Aryan brothers who fanned him, in an illiberal way.

RHYME a a *

May set in with a dust-storm,--Pagett went down with the sun.
All the delights of the season tickled him one by one.
Imprimis--ten day's "liver"--due to his drinking beer;
Later, a dose of fever--slight, but he called it severe.

RHYME a a *

Dysent'ry touched him in June, after the Chota Bursat--
Lowered his portly person--made him yearn to depart.
He didn't call me a "Brahmin," or "bloated," or "overpaid,"
But seemed to think it a wonder that any one stayed.

RHYME a a *

July was a trifle unhealthy,--Pagett was ill with fear.
'Called it the "Cholera Morbus," hinted that life was dear.
He babbled of "Eastern Exile," and mentioned his home with tears;
But I haven't seen my children for close upon seven years.

RHYME a a *

We reached a hundred and twenty once in the Court at noon,
(I've mentioned Pagett was portly) Pagett, went off in a swoon.
That was an end to the business; Pagett, the perjured, fled
With a practical, working knowledge of "Solar Myths" in his head.

RHYME a a *

And I laughed as I drove from the station, but the mirth died out on my lips
As I thought of the fools like Pagett who write of their "Eastern trips,"
And the sneers of the traveled idiots who duly misgovern the land,
And I prayed to the Lord to deliver another one into my hand.

How shall she know the worship we would do her?
  The walls are high, and she is very far.
How shall the woman's message reach unto her
  Above the tumult of the packed bazaar?
    Free wind of March, against the lattice blowing,
    Bear thou our thanks, lest she depart unknowing.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Go forth across the fields we may not roam in,
  Go forth beyond the trees that rim the city,
To whatsoe'er fair place she hath her home in,
  Who dowered us with wealth of love and pity.
    Out of our shadow pass, and seek her singing--
    "I have no gifts but Love alone for bringing."

RHYME a b a b c c 

Say that we be a feeble folk who greet her,
  But old in grief, and very wise in tears;
Say that we, being desolate, entreat her
  That she forget us not in after years;
    For we have seen the light, and it were grievous
    To dim that dawning if our lady leave us.

RHYME a b a b c c 

By life that ebbed with none to stanch the failing
  By Love's sad harvest garnered in the spring,
When Love in ignorance wept unavailing
  O'er young buds dead before their blossoming;
    By all the grey owl watched, the pale moon viewed,
    In past grim years, declare our gratitude!

RHYME a b a b c c 

By hands uplifted to the Gods that heard not,
  By fits that found no favor in their sight,
By faces bent above the babe that stirred not,
  By nameless horrors of the stifling night;
    By ills foredone, by peace her toils discover,
    Bid Earth be good beneath and Heaven above her!

RHYME a b a b c c 

If she have sent her servants in our pain
  If she have fought with Death and dulled his sword;
If she have given back our sick again.
  And to the breast the waking lips restored,
    Is it a little thing that she has wrought?
    Then Life and Death and Motherhood be nought.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Go forth, O wind, our message on thy wings,
  And they shall hear thee pass and bid thee speed,
In reed-roofed hut, or white-walled home of kings,

    Shall be a tasselled floorcloth to thy feet.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Haste, for our hearts are with thee, take no rest!
  Loud-voiced ambassador, from sea to sea
Proclaim the blessing, manifold, confessed.
  Of those in darkness by her hand set free.

    And whisper: "Lady, lo, they know and love!"

One moment bid the horses wait,
  Since tiffin is not laid till three,
Below the upward path and straight
  You climbed a year ago with me.
Love came upon us suddenly
  And loosed--an idle hour to kill--
A headless, armless armory
  That smote us both on Jakko Hill.

RHYME a b a b *

Ah Heaven! we would wait and wait
  Through Time and to Eternity!
Ah Heaven! we could conquer Fate
  With more than Godlike constancy
I cut the date upon a tree--

"10-7-85 , A.D."
  Damp with the mist of Jakko Hill.

RHYME a b a b *

What came of high resolve and great,
  And until Death fidelity!
Whose horse is waiting at your gate?
  Whose 'rickshaw-wheels ride over me?
No Saint's, I swear; and--let me see

We drift asunder merrily,
  As drifts the mist on Jakko Hill.

RHYME a b a b *

Princess, behold our ancient state
  Has clean departed; and we see
'Twas Idleness we took for Fate

Since Love and Leave together flee
  As driven mist on Jakko Hill!

The rooms are taken from us, swept and  garnished for their fate.

That we cried against the crime of it--    too late, alas! too late!

"What have we ever done to bear this grudge?"
  Was there no room save only in Benmore
For docket, duftar, and for office drudge,
  That you usurp our smoothest dancing floor?
Must babus do their work on polished teak?
  Are ball-rooms fittest for the ink you spill?
Was there no other cheaper house to seek?
  You might have left them all at Strawberry Hill.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

We never harmed you! Innocent our guise,
  Dainty our shining feet, our voices low;
And we revolved to divers melodies,
  And we were happy but a year ago.
Tonight, the moon that watched our lightsome wiles--
  That beamed upon us through the deodars--
Is wan with gazing on official files,
  And desecrating desks disgust the stars.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

Nay! by the memory of tuneful nights--
  Nay! by the witchery of flying feet--
Nay! by the glamour of foredone delights--
  By all things merry, musical, and meet--
By wine that sparkled, and by sparkling eyes--
  By wailing waltz--by reckless galop's strain--
By dim verandas and by soft replies,
  Give us our ravished ball-room back again!

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

Or--hearken to the curse we lay on you!
  The ghosts of waltzes shall perplex your brain,
And murmurs of past merriment pursue
  Your 'wildered clerks that they indite in vain;
And when you count your poor Provincial millions,
  The only figures that your pen shall frame
Shall be the figures of dear, dear cotillions
  Danced out in tumult long before you came.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

Yea! "See Saw" shall upset your estimates,
  "Dream Faces" shall your heavy heads bemuse,
Because your hand, unheeding, desecrates
  Our temple; fit for higher, worthier use.
And all the long verandas, eloquent
  With echoes of a score of Simla years,
Shall plague you with unbidden sentiment--
  Babbling of kisses, laughter, love, and tears.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

So shall you mazed amid old memories stand,
  So shall you toil, and shall accomplish nought,
And ever in your ears a phantom Band
  Shall blare away the staid official thought.
Wherefore--and ere this awful curse he spoken,
  Cast out your swarthy sacrilegious train,
And give--ere dancing cease and hearts be broken--
  Give us our ravished ball-room back again!

        That night, when through the mooring-chains
            The wide-eyed corpse rolled free,
          To blunder down by Garden Reach
            And rot at Kedgeree,
          The tale the Hughli told the shoal
            The lean shoal told to me.

RHYME a b c b d b 

'T was Fultah Fisher's boarding-house,
  Where sailor-men reside,
And there were men of all the ports
  From Mississip to Clyde,
And regally they spat and smoked,
  And fearsomely they lied.

RHYME a b c b d b 

They lied about the purple Sea
  That gave them scanty bread,
They lied about the Earth beneath,
  The Heavens overhead,
For they had looked too often on
  Black rum when that was red.

RHYME a b c b d b 

They told their tales of wreck and wrong,
  Of shame and lust and fraud,
They backed their toughest statements with
  The Brimstone of the Lord,
And crackling oaths went to and fro
  Across the fist-banged board.

RHYME a b c b d b 

And there was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
  Bull-throated, bare of arm,
Who carried on his hairy chest
  The maid Ultruda's charm--
The little silver crucifix
  That keeps a man from harm.

RHYME a b c b d b 

And there was Jake Without-the-Ears,
  And Pamba the Malay,
And Carboy Gin the Guinea cook,
  And Luz from Vigo Bay,
And Honest Jack who sold them slops
  And harvested their pay.

RHYME a b c b d b 

And there was Salem Hardieker,
  A lean Bostonian he--
Russ, German, English, Halfbreed, Finn,
  Yank, Dane, and Portuguee,
At Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
  They rested from the sea.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Now Anne of Austria shared their drinks,
  Collinga knew her fame,
From Tarnau in Galicia
  To Juan Bazaar she came,
To eat the bread of infamy
  And take the wage of shame.

RHYME a b c b d b 

She held a dozen men to heel--
  Rich spoil of war was hers,
In hose and gown and ring and chain,
  From twenty mariners,
And, by Port Law, that week, men called
  her Salem Hardieker's.

RHYME a b c b d b 

But seamen learnt--what landsmen know--
  That neither gifts nor gain
Can hold a winking Light o' Love
  Or Fancy's flight restrain,
When Anne of Austria rolled her eyes
  On Hans the blue-eyed Dane.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Since Life is strife, and strife means knife,
  From Howrah to the Bay,
And he may die before the dawn
  Who liquored out the day,
In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
  We woo while yet we may.

RHYME a b c b d b 

But cold was Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
  Bull-throated, bare of arm,
And laughter shook the chest beneath
  The maid Ultruda's charm--
The little silver crucifix
  That keeps a man from harm.

RHYME a b c b d b 

"You speak to Salem Hardieker;
  "You was his girl, I know.
"I ship mineselfs tomorrow, see,

  "To Besser in Saro."

RHYME a b c b d b 

When love rejected turns to hate,
  All ill betide the man.
"You speak to Salem Hardieker"--
  She spoke as woman can.
A scream--a sob--"He called me--names!"
  And then the fray began.

RHYME a b c b d b 

An oath from Salem Hardieker,
  A shriek upon the stairs,
A dance of shadows on the wall,
  A knife-thrust unawares--
And Hans came down, as cattle drop,
  Across the broken chairs.

RHYME a b c b d b 

In Anne of Austria's trembling hands
  The weary head fell low:--
"I ship mineselfs tomorrow, straight
  "For Besser in Saro;
"Und there Ultruda comes to me
  "At Easter, und I go--

RHYME a b c b d b 

"South, down the Cattegat--What's here?
  "There--are--no--lights--to guide!"
The mutter ceased, the spirit passed,
  And Anne of Austria cried
In Fultah Fisher's boarding-house
  When Hans the mighty died.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Thus slew they Hans the blue-eyed Dane,
  Bull-throated, bare of arm,
But Anne of Austria looted first
  The maid Ultruda's charm--
The little silver crucifix
  That keeps a man from harm.

But the colt who is wise will abstain from the terrible thorn-bit of Marriage.

As the thriftless gold of the babul, so is the gold that we spend
On a derby Sweep, or our neighbor's wife, or the horse that we buy from a friend.

The ways of man with a maid be strange, yet simple and tame
To the ways of a man with a horse, when selling or racing that same.

In public Her face turneth to thee, and pleasant Her smile when ye meet.
It is ill. The cold rocks of El-Gidar smile thus on the waves at their feet.

RHYME a a *

In public Her face is averted, with anger. She nameth thy name.
It is well. Was there ever a loser content with the loss of the game?

RHYME a a *

If She have spoken a word, remember thy lips are sealed,
And the Brand of the Dog is upon him by whom is the secret revealed.

If She have written a letter, delay not an instant, but burn it.
Tear it to pieces, O Fool, and the wind to her mate shall return it!

My Son, if a maiden deny thee and scufflingly bid thee give o'er,
Yet lip meets with lip at the last word--get out! She has been there before.
They are pecked on the ear and the chin and the nose who are lacking in lore.

If we fall in the race, though we win, the hoof-slide is scarred on the course.

"By all I am misunderstood!" if the Matron shall say, or the Maid:
"Alas! I do not understand," my son, be thou nowise afraid.
In vain in the sight of the Bird is the net of the Fowler displayed.

RHYME a a a 

My son, if I, Hafiz, the father, take hold of thy knees in my pain,
Demanding thy name on stamped paper, one day or one hour--refrain.
Are the links of thy fetters so light that thou cravest another man's chain?

There's a widow in sleepy Chester
  Who weeps for her only son;
There's a grave on the Pabeng River,
  A grave that the Burmans shun,
And there's Subadar Prag Tewarri
  Who tells how the work was done.

RHYME a b c b d b 

A Snider squibbed in the jungle,
  Somebody laughed and fled,
And the men of the First Shikaris
  Picked up their Subaltern dead,
With a big blue mark in his forehead
  And the back blown out of his head.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Subadar Prag Tewarri,
  Jemadar Hira Lal,
Took command of the party,
  Twenty rifles in all,
Marched them down to the river
  As the day was beginning to fall.

RHYME a b c b d b 

They buried the boy by the river,
  A blanket over his face--
They wept for their dead Lieutenant,
  The men of an alien race--
They made a samadh in his honor,
  A mark for his resting-place.

RHYME a b c b d b 

For they swore by the Holy Water,
  They swore by the salt they ate,
That the soul of Lieutenant Eshmitt Sahib
  Should go to his God in state;
With fifty file of Burman
  To open him Heaven's gate.

RHYME a b c b d b 

The men of the First Shikaris
  Marched till the break of day,
Till they came to the rebel village,
  The village of Pabengmay--
A jingal covered the clearing,
  Calthrops hampered the way.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Subadar Prag Tewarri,
  Bidding them load with ball,
Halted a dozen rifles
  Under the village wall;
Sent out a flanking-party
  With Jemadar Hira Lal.

RHYME a b c b d b 

The men of the First Shikaris
  Shouted and smote and slew,
Turning the grinning jingal
  On to the howling crew.
The Jemadar's flanking-party
  Butchered the folk who flew.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Long was the morn of slaughter,
  Long was the list of slain,
Five score heads were taken,
  Five score heads and twain;
And the men of the First Shikaris
  Went back to their grave again,

RHYME a b c b d b 

Each man bearing a basket
  Red as his palms that day,
Red as the blazing village--
  The village of Pabengmay,
And the "drip-drip-drip" from the baskets
  Reddened the grass by the way.

RHYME a b c b d b 

They made a pile of their trophies
  High as a tall man's chin,
Head upon head distorted,
  Set in a sightless grin,
Anger and pain and terror
  Stamped on the smoke-scorched skin.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Subadar Prag Tewarri
  Put the head of the Boh
On the top of the mound of triumph,
  The head of his son below,
With the sword and the peacock-banner
  That the world might behold and know.

RHYME a b c b d b 

Thus the samadh was perfect,
  Thus was the lesson plain
Of the wrath of the First Shikaris--
  The price of a white man slain;
And the men of the First Shikaris
  Went back into camp again.

RHYME a b c b d d b 

Then a silence came to the river,
  A hush fell over the shore,
And Bohs that were brave departed,
  And Sniders squibbed no more;
    For the Burmans said
    That a kullah's head
Must be paid for with heads five score.

RHYME a b c b d b 

There's a widow in sleepy Chester
  Who weeps for her only son;
There's a grave on the Pabeng River,
  A grave that the Burmans shun,
And there's Subadar Prag Tewarri
  Who tells how the work was done.

Beneath the deep veranda's shade,
  When bats begin to fly,
I sit me down and watch--alas!--

Blood-red behind the sere ferash

Sainted Diana! can that be

RHYME a b c b *

Ah! shade of little Kitty Smith,
  Sweet Saint of Kensington!
Say, was it ever thus at Home
  The Moon of August shone,
When arm in arm we wandered long

And Hammersmith was Heaven beneath
  The Moon of Other Days?

RHYME a b c b *

But Wandle's stream is Sutlej now,
  And Putney's evening haze
The dust that half a hundred kine
  Before my window raise.
Unkempt, unclean, athwart the mist
  The seething city looms,
In place of Putney's golden gorse
  The sickly babul blooms.

RHYME a b c b *

Glare down, old Hecate, through the dust,
  And bid the pie-dog yell,
Draw from the drain its typhoid-germ,

Yea, suck the fever from the tank

Thank Heaven, you show a smiling face

In the name of the Empress of India, make way,

  We exiles are waiting for letters from Home.
Let the robber retreat--let the tiger turn tail--
In the Name of the Empress, the Overland Mail!

RHYME a b a b c c 

With a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in,
  He turns to the foot-path that heads up the hill--
The bags on his back and a cloth round his chin,
  And, tucked in his waist-belt, the Post Office bill:
"Despatched on this date, as received by the rail,
Per runner, two bags of the Overland Mail."

RHYME a b a b c c 

Is the torrent in spate? He must ford it or swim.
  Has the rain wrecked the road? He must climb by the cliff.
Does the tempest cry "Halt"? What are tempests to him?
  The Service admits not a "but" or and "if."
While the breath's in his mouth, he must bear without fail,
In the Name of the Empress, the Overland Mail.

From aloe to rose-oak, from rose-oak to fir,
  From level to upland, from upland to crest,
From rice-field to rock-ridge, from rock-ridge to spur,

From rail to ravine--to the peak from the vale--
Up, up through the night goes the Overland Mail.

RHYME a b a b c c 

There's a speck on the hillside, a dot on the road--
  A jingle of bells on the foot-path below--
There's a scuffle above in the monkey's abode--
  The world is awake, and the clouds are aglow.
For the great Sun himself must attend to the hail:
"In the name of the Empress the Overland Mail!"

By the field where the young corn dies
In the face of the sultry skies,

RHYME a b c a b c 

They have heard, as the dull Earth hears
The voice of the wind of an hour,
The sound of the Great Queen's voice:
"My God hath given me years,
Hath granted dominion and power:
And I bid you, O Land, rejoice."

RHYME a b a b 

And the ploughman settles the share
More deep in the grudging clod;
For he saith: "The wheat is my care,
And the rest is the will of God.

He sent the Mahratta spear
As He sendeth the rain,
And the Mlech, in the fated year,
Broke the spear in twain.

And was broken in turn. Who knows
How our Lords make strife?
It is good that the young wheat grows,
For the bread is Life."

RHYME a b a a b 

Then, far and near, as the twilight drew,
Hissed up to the scornful dark
Great serpents, blazing, of red and blue,

RHYME a b a a b 

"Today is a day of days," they said,
"Make merry, O People, all!"

More deep in the sun-dried clod:
"Mogul Mahratta, and Mlech from the North,
And White Queen over the Seas--
God raiseth them up and driveth them forth
As the dust of the ploughshare flies in the breeze;
But the wheat and the cattle are all my care,

The eldest son bestrides him,
And the pretty daughter rides him,
And I meet him oft o' mornings on the Course;
And there kindles in my bosom
An emotion chill and gruesome
As I canter past the Undertaker's Horse.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Neither shies he nor is restive,
But a hideously suggestive
Trot, professional and placid, he affects;
And the cadence of his hoof-beats
To my mind this grim reproof beats:--
"Mend your pace, my friend, I'm coming. Who's the next?"

RHYME a a b c c b 

Ah! stud-bred of ill-omen,
I have watched the strongest go--men
Of pith and might and muscle--at your heels,
Down the plantain-bordered highway,
(Heaven send it ne'er be my way!)
In a lacquered box and jetty upon wheels.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Answer, sombre beast and dreary,
Where is Brown, the young, the cheery,
Smith, the pride of all his friends and half the Force?
You were at that last dread dak
We must cover at a walk,
Bring them back to me, O Undertaker's Horse!

RHYME a a b c c b 

With your mane unhogged and flowing,
And your curious way of going,
And that businesslike black crimping of your tail,
E'en with Beauty on your back, Sir,
Pacing as a lady's hack, Sir,
What wonder when I meet you I turn pale?

RHYME a a b c c b 

It may be you wait your time, Beast,
Till I write my last bad rhyme, Beast--
Quit the sunlight, cut the rhyming, drop the glass--
Follow after with the others,
Where some dusky heathen smothers
Us with marigolds in lieu of English grass.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Or, perchance, in years to follow,
I shall watch your plump sides hollow,
See Carnifex (gone lame) become a corse--
See old age at last o'erpower you,
And the Station Pack devour you,
I shall chuckle then, O Undertaker's Horse!

RHYME a a b c c b 

But to insult, jibe, and quest, I've
Still the hideously suggestive
Trot that hammers out the unrelenting text,
And I hear it hard behind me
In what place soe'er I find me:--
"'Sure to catch you sooner or later. Who's the next?"

Open the old cigar-box, get me a Cuba stout,
For things are running crossways, and Maggie and I are out.

RHYME a a 

We quarrelled about Havanas--we fought o'er a good cheroot,
And I knew she is exacting, and she says I am a brute.

RHYME a a 

Open the old cigar-box--let me consider a space;
In the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on Maggie's face.

RHYME a a 

Maggie is pretty to look at--Maggie's a loving lass,
But the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle, the truest of loves must pass.

RHYME a a 

There's peace in a Larranaga, there's calm in a Henry Clay;
But the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away--

RHYME a a 

Thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown--
But I could not throw away Maggie for fear o' the talk o' the town!

RHYME a a 

Maggie, my wife at fifty--grey and dour and old--
With never another Maggie to purchase for love or gold!

RHYME a a 

And the light of Days that have Been the dark of the Days that Are,
And Love's torch stinking and stale, like the butt of a dead cigar--

RHYME a a 

The butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket--
With never a new one to light tho' it's charred and black to the socket!

RHYME a a 

Open the old cigar-box--let me consider a while.
Here is a mild Manila--there is a wifely smile.

RHYME a a 

Which is the better portion--bondage bought with a ring,
Or a harem of dusky beauties, fifty tied in a string?

RHYME a a 

Counsellors cunning and silent--comforters true and tried,
And never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride?

RHYME a a 

Thought in the early morning, solace in time of woes,
Peace in the hush of the twilight, balm ere my eyelids close,

RHYME a a 

This will the fifty give me, asking nought in return,
With only a Suttee's passion--to do their duty and burn.

RHYME a a 

This will the fifty give me. When they are spent and dead,
Five times other fifties shall be my servants instead.

RHYME a a 

The furrows of far-off Java, the isles of the Spanish Main,
When they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again.

RHYME a a 

I will take no heed to their raiment, nor food for their mouths withal,
So long as the gulls are nesting, so long as the showers fall.

RHYME a a 

I will scent 'em with best vanilla, with tea will I temper their hides,
And the Moor and the Mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides.

RHYME a a 

For Maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
The wee little whimpering Love and the great god Nick o' Teen.

RHYME a a 

And I have been servant of Love for barely a twelvemonth clear,
But I have been Priest of Cabanas a matter of seven year;

RHYME a a 

And the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
Of stumps that I burned to Friendship and Pleasure and Work and Fight.

RHYME a a 

And I turn my eyes to the future that Maggie and I must prove,
But the only light on the marshes is the Will-o'-the-Wisp of Love.

RHYME a a 

Will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire?
Since a puff of tobacco can cloud it, shall I follow the fitful fire?

RHYME a a 

Open the old cigar-box--let me consider anew--
Old friends, and who is Maggie that I should abandon you?

RHYME a a 

A million surplus Maggies are willing to bear the yoke;
And a woman is only a woman, but a good Cigar is a Smoke.

RHYME a a 

Light me another Cuba--I hold to my first-sworn vows.
If Maggie will have no rival, I'll have no Maggie for Spouse!

Where the sober-colored cultivator smiles
    On his byles;
Where the cholera, the cyclone, and the crow
    Come and go;
Where the merchant deals in indigo and tea,
    Hides and ghi;
Where the Babu drops inflammatory hints
    In his prints;
Stands a City--Charnock chose it--packed away
    Near a Bay--
By the Sewage rendered fetid, by the sewer
    Made impure,
By the Sunderbunds unwholesome, by the swamp
    Moist and damp;
And the City and the Viceroy, as we see,
    Don't agree.

RHYME a a *

Once, two hundred years ago, the trader came
    Meek and tame.

RHYME a a *

Where his timid foot first halted, there he stayed,
    Till mere trade
Grew to Empire, and he sent his armies forth
    South and North
Till the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
    Was his own.

RHYME a a *

Thus the midday halt of Charnock--more's the pity!
    Grew a City.

RHYME a a *

As the fungus sprouts chaotic from its bed,
    So it spread--
Chance-directed, chance-erected, laid and built
    On the silt--
Palace, byre, hovel--poverty and pride--
    Side by side;
And, above the packed and pestilential town,
    Death looked down.

RHYME a a *

But the Rulers in that City by the Sea
    Turned to flee--
Fled, with each returning spring-tide from its ills
    To the Hills.

RHYME a a *

From the clammy fogs of morning, from the blaze
    Of old days,
From the sickness of the noontide, from the heat,
    Beat retreat;
For the country from Peshawur to Ceylon
    Was their own.

RHYME a a *

But the Merchant risked the perils of the Plain
    For his gain.

RHYME a a *

Now the resting-place of Charnock, 'neath the palms,
    Asks an alms,
And the burden of its lamentation is, 
    Briefly, this:
"Because for certain months, we boil and stew,
    So should you.

RHYME a a *

Cast the Viceroy and his Council, to perspire
    In our fire!"
And for answer to the argument, in vain
    We explain
That an amateur Saint Lawrence cannot fry:
    "All must fry!"
That the Merchant risks the perils of the Plain
    For gain.

RHYME a a *

Nor can Rulers rule a house that men grow rich in,
    From its kitchen.

RHYME a a *

Let the Babu drop inflammatory hints
  In his prints;
And mature--consistent soul--his plan for stealing
  To Darjeeling:
Let the Merchant seek, who makes his silver pile,
    England's isle;
Let the City Charnock pitched on--evil day!
    Go Her way.

RHYME a a *

Though the argosies of Asia at Her doors
    Heap their stores,
Though Her enterprise and energy secure
    Income sure,
Though "out-station orders punctually obeyed"
    Swell Her trade--
Still, for rule, administration, and the rest,
    Simla's best.

    I that obscured have fled the scene of fame,
      Intitling my conceits to nought but care,
      I that have lived a phoenix in love's flame,
    And felt that death I never would declare,
      Now mount the theater of this our age,
      To plead my faith and Cupid's cursed rage.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Oh you high sp'rited paragons of wit,
    That fly to fame beyond our earthly pitch,
    Whose sense is sound, whose words are feat and fit,
    Able to make the coyest ear to itch;
      Shroud with your mighty wings that mount so well,
      These little loves, new crept from out the shell.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    And thou the true Octavia of our time,
    Under whose worth beauty was never matched,
    The genius of my muse and ragged rime,
    Smile on these little loves but lately hatched,
      Who from the wrastling waves have made retreat,
      To plead for life before thy judgment seat.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    And though the fore-bred brothers they have had,
    Who in their swan-like songs Amintas wept,
    For all their sweet-thought sighs had fortune bad,

RHYME a b a b c c 

    And if these infants of mine artless brain,

    My Muse enfranchised from forgetfulness
      Shall hatch such breed in honour of thy name,
      As modern poets shall admire the same.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    As modern poets shall admire the same;
    I mean not you (you never matched men)
    Who brought the chaos of our tongue in frame,
    Through these Herculean labours of your pen;
      I mean the mean, I mean no men divine,
      But such whose feathers are but waxed like mine.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Go, weeping truce-men in your sighing weeds,
    Under a great Maecenas I have passed you;
    If so you come where learned Colin feeds
    His lovely flock, pack thence and quickly haste you;
      You are but mists before so bright a sun,
      Who hath the palm for deep invention won.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Kiss Delia's hand for her sweet prophet's sake,
    Whose not affected but well couched tears
    Have power, have worth, a marble mind to shake,
    Whose fame no iron-age or time outwears.
      Then lay you down in Phillis' lap and sleep,
      Until the weeping read, and reading weep.

    Oh pleasing thoughts, apprentices of love,
    Fore-runners of desire, sweet mithridates
    The poison of my sorrows to remove,
    With whom my hopes and fear full oft debates!
      Enrich yourselves and me by your self riches,
    Which are the thoughts you spend on heaven-bred beauty,
    Rouse you my muse beyond our poets' pitches,
    And, working wonders, yet say all is duty!
      Use you no eaglets' eyes, nor phoenix' feathers,
    To tower the heaven from whence heaven's wonder sallies.
    For why? Your sun sings sweetly to her weathers,
    Making a spring of winter in the valleys.
      Show to the world though poor and scant my skill is
      How sweet thoughts be, that are but thought on Phillis!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      You sacred sea-nymphs pleasantly disporting
    Amidst this wat'ry world, where now I sail;
    If ever love, or lovers sad reporting,
    Had power sweet tears from your fair eyes to hail;
      And you, more gentle-hearted than the rest,
    Under the northern noon-stead sweetly streaming,
    Lend those moist riches of your crystal crest,
    To quench the flames from my heart's AEtna streaming;
      And thou, kind Triton, in thy trumpet relish
    The ruthful accents of my discontent,
    That midst this travel desolate and hellish,
    Some gentle wind that listens my lament
      May prattle in the north in Phillis' ears:
      "Where Phillis wants, Damon consumes in tears."

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      In fancy's world an Atlas have I been,
    Where yet the chaos of my ceaseless care
    Is by her eyes unpitied and unseen,
    In whom all gifts but pity planted are;
      For mercy though still cries my moan-clad muse,
    And every paper that she sends to beauty,
    In tract of sable tears brings woeful news,
    Of my true heart-kind thoughts, and loyal duty.
      But ah the strings of her hard heart are strained
    Beyond the harmony of my desires;
    And though the happy heavens themselves have pained,
    To tame her heart whose will so far aspires,
      Yet she who claims the title of world's wonder,
      Thinks all deserts too base to bring her under.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Long hath my sufferance laboured to enforce
    One pearl of pity from her pretty eyes,
    Whilst I with restless rivers of remorse,
    Have bathed the banks where my fair Phillis lies.
      The moaning lines which weeping I have written,
    And writing read unto my ruthful sheep,
    And reading sent with tears that never fitten,
    To my love's queen, that hath my heart in keep,
      Have made my lambkins lay them down and sigh;
    But Phillis sits, and reads, and calls them trifles.
    Oh heavens, why climb not happy lines so high,
    To rent that ruthless heart that all hearts rifles!
      None writes with truer faith, or greater love,
      Yet out, alas! I have no power to move.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Ah pale and dying infant of the spring,
    How rightly now do I resemble thee!
    That selfsame hand that thee from stalk did wring,
    Hath rent my breast and robbed my heart from me.
      Yet shalt thou live. For why? Thy native vigour
    Shall thrive by woeful dew-drops of my dolor;
    And from the wounds I bear through fancy's rigour,
    My streaming blood shall yield the crimson color.
      The ravished sighs that ceaseless take their issue
    From out the furnace of my heart inflamed,
    To yield you lasting springs shall never miss you;
    So by my plaints and pains, you shall be famed.
    Let my heart's heat and cold, thy crimson nourish,
    And by my sorrows let thy beauty flourish.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      It is not death which wretched men call dying,
    But that is very death which I endure,
    When my coy-looking nymph, her grace envying,
    By fatal frowns my domage doth procure.
      It is not life which we for life approve,
    But that is life when on her wool-soft paps
    I seal sweet kisses which do batten love,
    And doubling them do treble my good haps.
      'Tis neither love the son, nor love the mother,
    Which lovers praise and pray to; but that love is
    Which she in eye and I in heart do smother.
    Then muse not though I glory in my miss,
      Since she who holds my heart and me in durance,
      Hath life, death, love and all in her procurance.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      How languisheth the primrose of love's garden!
    How trill her tears, th' elixir of my senses!
    Ambitious sickness, what doth thee so harden?
    Oh spare, and plague thou me for her offences!
      Ah roses, love's fair roses, do not languish;
    Blush through the milk-white veil that holds you covered.
    If heat or cold may mitigate your anguish,
    I'll burn, I'll freeze, but you shall be recovered.
      Good God, would beauty mark now she is crased,
    How but one shower of sickness makes her tender,
    Her judgments then to mark my woes amazed,
    To mercy should opinion's fort surrender!
      And I,--oh would I might, or would she meant it!
      Should hery[A] love, who now in heart lament it.

RHYME a b a b a b c d c d e e 

      No stars her eyes to clear the wandering night,
    But shining suns of true divinity,
    That make the soul conceive her perfect light!
    No wanton beauties of humanity
      Her pretty brows, but beams that clear the sight
    Of him that seeks the true philosophy!
    No coral is her lip, no rose her fair,
    But even that crimson that adorns the sun.
      No nymph is she, but mistress of the air,
    By whom my glories are but new begun.
      But when I touch and taste as others do,
      I then shall write and you shall wonder too.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      The dewy roseate Morn had with her hairs
    In sundry sorts the Indian clime adorned;
    And now her eyes apparreled in tears,
    The loss of lovely Memnon long had mourned,
      When as she spied the nymph whom I admire,
    Combing her locks, of which the yellow gold
    Made blush the beauties of her curled wire,
    Which heaven itself with wonder might behold;
      Then red with shame, her reverend locks she rent,
    And weeping hid the beauty of her face,
    The flower of fancy wrought such discontent;
    The sighs which midst the air she breathed a space,
      A three-days' stormy tempest did maintain,
      Her shame a fire, her eyes a swelling rain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      The rumour runs that here in Isis swim
    Such stately swans so confident in dying,
    That when they feel themselves near Lethe's brim,
    They sing their fatal dirge when death is nighing.
      And I like these that feel my wounds are mortal,
    Contented die for her whom I adore;
    And in my joyful hymns do still exhort all
    To die for such a saint or love no more.
      Not that my torments or her tyranny
    Enforce me to enjoin so hard a task,
    But for I know, and yield no reason why,
    But will them try that have desire to ask.
      As love hath wreaths his pretty eyes to seel,
      So lovers must keep secret what they feel.

RHYME a b a b b c c d e d e e f f 

      My frail and earthly bark, by reason's guide,
    Which holds the helm, whilst will doth wield the sail,
    By my desires, the winds of bad betide,
    Hath sailed these worldly seas with small avail,
      Vain objects serve for dreadful rocks to quail
    My brittle boat from haven of life that flies
    To haunt the sea of mundane miseries.
    My soul that draws impressions from above,
      And views my course, and sees the winds aspire,
    Bids reason watch to scape the shoals of love;
    But lawless will enflamed with endless ire
    Doth steer empoop,[B] whilst reason doth retire.
      The streams increase; love's waves my bark do fill;
      Thus are they wracked that guide their course by will.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g h g h 

      Ah trees, why fall your leaves so fast?
    Ah rocks, where are your robes of moss?
    Ah flocks, why stand you all aghast?
    Trees, rocks, and flocks, what, are you pensive for my loss?
      The birds methinks tune naught but moan,
    The winds breathe naught but bitter plaint,
    The beasts forsake their dens to groan;
    Birds, winds, and beasts, what doth my loss your powers attaint?
      Floods weep their springs above their bounds,
    And echo wails to see my woe,
    The robe of ruth doth clothe the grounds;
    Floods, echo, grounds, why do you all these tears bestow?
      The trees, the rocks, and flocks reply,
      The birds, the winds, the beasts report,
      Floods, echo, grounds, for sorrow cry,
    We grieve since Phillis nill kind Damon's love consort.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g h g h i i 

      Love guides the roses of thy lips,
    And flies about them like a bee;
    If I approach he forward skips,
    And if I kiss he stingeth me.
      Love in thine eyes doth build his bower,
    And sleeps within their pretty shine;
    And if I look the boy will lower,
    And from their orbs shoots shafts divine.
      Love works thy heart within his fire,
    And in my tears doth firm the same;
    And if I tempt it will retire,
    And of my plaints doth make a game.
      Love, let me cull her choicest flowers,
    And pity me, and calm her eye,
    Make soft her heart, dissolve her lowers,
    Then will I praise thy deity.
      But if thou do not love, I'll truly serve her
      In spite of thee, and by firm faith deserve her.

RHYME a b a b c d c e f g f g h h 

      I wrote in Mirrha's bark, and as I wrote,
    Poor Mirrha wept because I wrote forsaken;
    'Twas of thy pride I sung in weeping note,
    When as her leaves great moan for pity maken.
      The falling fountains from the mountains falling,
    Cried out, alas, so fair and be so cruel!
    And babbling echo never ceased calling,
    Phillis, disdain is fit for none but truthless.
      The rising pines wherein I had engraved
    Thy memory consulting with the wind,
    Are trucemen to thy heart and thoughts depraved,
    And say, thy kind should not be so unkind.
      But, out alas! so fell is Phillis fearless,
      That she hath made her Damon well nigh tearless.

RHYME a b c b d e f e 

    My Phillis hath the morning sun
      At first to look upon her.
    And Phillis hath morn-waking birds,
      Her risings for to honour.
    My Phillis hath prime-feathered flowers,
      That smile when she treads on them,
    And Phillis hath a gallant flock,
      That leaps since she doth own them.

RHYME a b a b c c d d e e f f 

    But Phillis hath so hard a heart--
      Alas that she should have it!--
    As yields no mercy to desert,
      Nor grace to those that crave it.
      Sweet sun, when thou look'st on,
      Pray her regard my moan.
      Sweet birds, when you sing to her,
      To yield some pity woo her.
      Sweet flowers, whenas she treads on,
      Tell her, her beauty deads one.
    And if in life her love she nill agree me,
    Pray her before I die, she will come see me.

RHYME a b a b c c d e d e 

    I part; but how? from joy, from hope, from life;
    I leave; but whom? love's pride, wit's pomp, heart's bliss;
    I pine; for what? for grief, for thought, for strife;
    I faint; and why? because I see my miss.
      Oh ceaseless pains that never may be told,
      You make me weep as I to water would!
    Ah weary hopes, in deep oblivious streams
    Go seek your graves, since you have lost your grounds!
    Ah pensive heart, seek out her radiant gleams!
    For why? Thy bliss is shut within those bounds!
  
RHYME a a b c b c d d e e 

    All traitorous eyes, to[o] feeble in for[e] sight,
      Grow dim with woe, that now must want your light!
    I part from bliss to dwell with ceaseless moan,
    I part from life, since I from beauty part,
    I part from peace, to pine in care alone,
    I part from ease to die with dreadful smart.
    I part--oh death! for why? this world contains
    More care and woe than with despair remains.
      Oh loath depart, wherein such sorrows dwell,
      As all conceits are scant the same to tell!

RHYME a b b a a c c a 

      Ah fleeting weal, ah sly deluding sleep,
    That in one moment giv'st me joy and pain!
    How do my hopes dissolve to tears in vain,
    As wont the snows, 'fore angry sun to weep!
      Ah noisome life that hath no weal in keep!
    My forward grief hath form and working might;
    My pleasures like the shadows take their flight;
 My path to bliss is tedious, long and steep.

RHYME a b a a b c c 

    Twice happy thou Endymion that embracest
    The live-long night thy love within thine arms,
    Where thou fond dream my longed weal defacest
    Whilst fleeting and uncertain shades thou placest
    Before my eyes with false deluding charms!
      Ah instant sweets which do my heart revive,
      How should I joy if you were true alive!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      As where two raging venoms are united,
    Which of themselves dissevered life would sever,
    The sickly wretch of sickness is acquited,
    Which else should die, or pine in torments ever;
      So fire and frost, that hold my heart in seizure,
    Restore those ruins which themselves have wrought,
    Where if apart they both had had their pleasure,
    The earth long since her fatal claim had caught.
      Thus two united deaths keep me from dying;
    I burne in ice, and quake amidst the fire,
    No hope midst these extremes or favour spying;
    Thus love makes me a martyr in his ire.
      So that both cold and heat do rather feed
      My ceaseless pains, than any comfort breed.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Thou tyrannizing monarch that dost tire
    My love-sick heart through those assaulting eyes,
    That are the lamps which lighten my desire!
    If nought but death thy fury may suffice,
      Not for my peace, but for thy pleasure be it,
    That Phillis, wrathful Phillis that repines me
    All grace but death, may deign to come and see it,
    And seeing grieve at that which she assigns me.
      This only boon for all my mortal bane
    I crave and cry for at thy mercy seat:
    That when her wrath a faithful heart hath slain,
    And soul is fled, and body reft of heat,
      She might perceive how much she might command,
      That had my life and death within her hand.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

    Some praise the looks, and others praise the locks
    Of their fair queens, in love with curious words;
    Some laud the breast where love his treasure locks,
    All like the eye that life and love affords.
      But none of these frail beauties and unstable
    Shall make my pen riot in pompous style;
    More greater gifts shall my grave muse enable,
    Whereat severer brows shall never smile.
      I praise her honey-sweeter eloquence,
    Which from the fountain of true wisdom floweth,
    Her modest mien that matcheth excellence,
    Her matchless faith which from her virtue groweth;
      And could my style her happy virtues equal,
      Time had no power her glories to enthral.

RHYME a b a b c c d e d e f f 

    Now scourge of winter's wrack is well nigh spent,
    And sun gins look more longer on our clime,
    And earth no more to sorrow doth consent,
    Why been thy looks forlorn that view the prime?
      Unneth thy flocks may feed to see thee faint,
      Thou lost, they lean, and both with woe attaint.
    For shame! Cast off these discontented looks;
    For grief doth wait on life, though never sought;
    So Thenot wrote admired for pipe and books.
    Then to the spring attemper thou thy thought,
      And let advice rear up thy drooping mind,
      And leave to weep thy woes unto the wind.

RHYME a b a b c c d e d e 

    Ah Demades, no wonder though I wail,
    For even the spring is winter unto me!
    Look as the sun the earth doth then avail,
    When by his beams her bowels warmed be;
      Even so a saint more sun-bright in her shining
      First wrought my weal, now hastes my winter's pining.
    Which lovely lamp withdrawn from my poor eyes,
    Both parts of earth and fire drowned up in woe
    In winter dwell. My joy, my courage dies;
    My lambs with me that do my winter know

RHYME a a b c b c d d e f e f g g 

      For pity scorn the spring that nigheth near,
      And pine to see their master's pining cheer.
    The root which yieldeth sap unto the tree
    Draws from the earth the means that make it spring;
    And by the sap the scions fostered be,
    All from the sun have comfort and increasing
      And that fair eye that lights this earthly ball
      Kills by depart, and nearing cheereth all.
    As root to tree, such is my tender heart,
    Whose sap is thought, whose branches are content;
    And from my soul they draw their sweet or smart,
    And from her eye, my soul's best life is lent;
    Which heavenly eye that lights both earth and air,
    Quells by depart and quickens by repair.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Give period to the process of thy plaint,
    Unhappy Damon, witty in self-grieving;
    Tend thou thy flocks; let tyrant love attaint
    Those tender hearts that made their love their living.
      And as kind time keeps Phillis from thy sight,
      So let prevention banish fancy quite.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Cast hence this idle fuel of desire,
    That feeds that flame wherein thy heart consumeth;
    Let reason school thy will which doth aspire,
    And counsel cool impatience that presumeth;
      Drive hence vain thoughts which are fond love's abettors,
      For he that seeks his thraldom merits fetters.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    The vain idea of this deity
    Nursed at the teat of thine imagination,
    Was bred, brought up by thine own vanity,
    Whose being thou mayst curse from the creation;
      And so thou list, thou may as soon forget love,
      As thou at first didst fashion and beget love.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Peace, Demades, peace shepherd, do not tempt me;
    The sage-taught wife may speak thus, but not practise;
    Rather from life than from my love exempt me,
    My happy love wherein my weal and wrack lies;
      Where chilly age first left love, and first lost her,
      There youth found love, liked love, and love did foster.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Not as ambitious of their[C] own decay,
    But curious to equal your fore-deeds,
    So tread we now within your wonted way;
    We find your fruits of judgments and their seeds;
      We know you loved, and loving learn that lore;
      You scorn kind love, because you can no more.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Though from this pure refiner of the thought
    The gleanings of your learnings have you gathered
    Your lives had been abortive, base and naught,
    Except by happy love they had been fathered;
      Then still the swain, for I will still avow it;
      They have no wit nor worth that disallow it.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Then to renew the ruins of my tears
    Be thou no hinderer, Demades, I pray thee.
    If my love-sighs grow tedious in thine ears,
    Fly me, that fly from joy, I list not stay thee.
      Mourn sheep, mourn lambs, and Damon will weep by you;
      And when I sigh, "Come home, sweet Phillis," cry you.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Come home, sweet Phillis, for thine absence causeth
    A flowerless prime-tide in these drooping meadows;
    To push his beauties forth each primrose pauseth,
    Our lilies and our roses like coy widows
      Shut in their buds, their beauties, and bemoan them,
      Because my Phillis doth not smile upon them.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    The trees by my redoubled sighs long blasted
    Call for thy balm-sweet breath and sunny eyes,
    To whom all nature's comforts are hand-fasted;
    Breathe, look on them, and they to life arise;
      They have new liveries with each smile thou lendest,
      And droop with me, when thy fair brow thou bendest.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    I woo thee, Phillis, with more earnest weeping
    Than Niobe for her dead issue spent;
    I pray thee, nymph who hast our spring in keeping,
    Thou mistress of our flowers and my content,
      Come home, and glad our meads of winter weary,
      And make thy woeful Damon blithe and merry.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Else will I captive all my hopes again,
    And shut them up in prisons of despair,
    And weep such tears as shall destroy this plain,
    And sigh such sighs as shall eclipse the air,
      And cry such cries as love that hears my crying
      Shall faint and weep for grief and fall a-dying.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    My little world hath vowed no sun shall glad it,
    Except thy little world her light discover,
    Of which heavens would grow proud if so they had it.
    Oh how I fear lest absent Jove should love her!
      I fear it, Phillis, for he never saw one
      That had more heaven-sweet looks to lure and awe one.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    I swear to thee, all-seeing sovereign
    Rolling heaven's circles round about our center,
    Except my Phillis safe return again,
    No joy to heart, no meat to mouth shall enter.
      All hope (but future hope to be renowned,
      For weeping Phillis) shall in tears be drowned.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    How large a scope lends Damon to his moan,
    Wafting those treasures of his happy wit
    In registering his woeful woe-begone!
    Ah bend thy muse to matters far more fit!
      For time shall come when Phillis is interred,
      That Damon shall confess that he hath erred.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    When nature's riches shall, by time dissolved,
    Call thee to see with more judicial eye
    How Phillis' beauties are to dust resolved,
    Thou then shalt ask thyself the reason why
      Thou wert so fond, since Phillis was so frail,
      To praise her gifts that should so quickly fail.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Have mercy on thyself, cease being idle,
    Let reason claim and gain of will his homage;
    Rein in these brain-sick thoughts with judgment's bridle,
    A short prevention helps a mighty domage.
      If Phillis love, love her, yet love her so
      That if she fly, thou may'st love's fire forego.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Play with the fire, yet die not in the flame;
    Show passions in thy words, but not in heart;
    Lest when thou think to bring thy thoughts in frame,
    Thou prove thyself a prisoner by thine art.
      Play with these babes of love, as apes with glasses,
      And put no trust in feathers, wind, or lasses.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    Did not thine age yield warrantise, old man,
    Impatience would enforce me to offend thee;
    Me list not now thy forward skill to scan,
    Yet will I pray that love may mend or end thee.
      Spring flowers, sea-tides, earth, grass, sky, stars shall banish,
      Before the thoughts of love or Phillis vanish.

RHYME a b a b c c 

    So get thee gone, and fold thy tender sheep,
    For lo, the great automaton of day
    In Isis stream his golden locks doth steep;
    Sad even her dusky mantle doth display;
      Light-flying fowls, the posts of night, disport them,
      And cheerful-looking vesper doth consort them.

RHYME a b a b c 

    Come you, my careful flock, forego you master,
    I'll fold you up and after fall a-sighing;
    Words have no worth my secret wounds to plaster;
    Naught may refresh my joys but Phillis nighing.
      Farewell, old Demades.

    Ah cruel winds, why call you hence away?
    Why make you breach betwixt my soul and me?
    Ye traitorous floods, why nil your floats delay
    Until my latest moans discoursed be?
    For though ye salt sea-gods withhold the rain
    Of all your floats and gentle winds be still,
    While I have wept such tears as might restrain
    The rage of tides and winds against their will.
    Ah shall I love your sight, bright shining eyes?
    And must my soul his life and glory leave?
    Must I forsake the bower where solace lives,
    To trust to tickle fates that still deceive?
    Alas, so wills the wanton queen of change,
    That each man tract this labyrinth of life
    With slippery steps, now wronged by fortune strange,
    Now drawn by counsel from the maze of strife!
    
RHYME a b a b *

    Ah joy! No joy because so soon thou fleetest,
    Hours, days, and times inconstant in your being!
    Oh life! No life, since with such chance thou meetest!
    Oh eyes! No eyes, since you must lose your seeing!
    Soul, be thou sad, dissolve thy living powers
    To crystal tears, and by their pores express
    The grief that my distressed soul devours!
    Clothe thou my body all in heaviness;
    My suns appeared fair smiling full of pleasure,
    But now the vale of absence overclouds them;
    They fed my heart with joys exceeding measure
    Which now shall die, since absence needs must shroud them.
    Yea, die! Oh death, sweet death, vouchsafe that blessing,
    That I may die the death whilst she regardeth!
    For sweet were death, and sweet were death's oppressing,
    If she look on who all my life awardeth.
    Oh thou that art the portion of my joy,
    Yet not the portion, for thou art the prime;
    Suppose my griefs, conceive the deep annoy
    That wounds my soul upon this sorry time!

    Pale is my face, and in my pale confesses
    The pain I suffer, since I needs must leave thee.
    Red are mine eyes through tears that them oppresses,
    Dulled are my sp'rits since fates do now bereave thee.
    And now, ah now, my plaints are quite prevented!
    The winds are fair the sails are hoised high,
    The anchors weighed, and now quite discontented,
    Grief so subdues my heart as it should die.
    A faint farewell with trembling hand I tender,
    And with my tears my papers are distained.
    Which closed up, my heart in them I render,
    To tell thee how at parting I complained.
    Vouchsafe his message that doth bring farewell,
    And for my sake let him with beauty dwell.

    Muses help me, sorrow swarmeth,
    Eyes are fraught with seas of languish;
    Heavy hope my solace harmeth,
    Mind's repast is bitter anguish.

RHYME a b a b 

    Eye of day regarded never
    Certain trust in world untrusty;
    Flattering hope beguileth ever
    Weary, old, and wanton lusty.

RHYME a b a b 

    Dawn of day beholds enthroned
    Fortune's darling, proud and dreadless;
    Darksome night doth hear him moaned,
    Who before was rich and needless.

RHYME a b a b 

    Rob the sphere of lines united,
    Make a sudden void in nature;
    Force the day to be benighted,
    Reave the cause of time and creature;

RHYME a b a b 

    Ere the world will cease to vary,
    This I weep for, this I sorrow.
    Muses, if you please to tarry,
    Further helps I mean to borrow.

RHYME a b a b 

    Courted once by fortune's favour,
    Compassed now with envy's curses,
    All my thoughts of sorrow savour,
    Hopes run fleeting like the sources.

RHYME a b a b 

    Ay me! Wanton scorn hath maimed
    All the joy my heart enjoyed;
    Thoughts their thinking have disclaimed,
    Hate my hopes hath quite annoyed.

RHYME a b a b 

    Scant regard my weal hath scanted,
    Looking coy hath forced my lowering;
    Nothing liked where nothing wanted
    Weds mine eyes to ceaseless showering.

RHYME a b a b 

    Former love was once admired,
    Present favour is estranged,
    Loath the pleasure long desired;
    Thus both men and thoughts are changed.

RHYME a b a b 

    Lovely swain with lucky guiding,
    Once (but now no more so friended)
    Thou my flocks hast had in minding,
    From the morn till day was ended.

RHYME a b a b 

    Drink and fodder, food and folding,
    Had my lambs and ewes together;
    I with them was still beholding,
    Both in warmth and winter weather.

RHYME a b a b 

    Now they languish since refused,
    Ewes and lambs are pained with pining;
    I with ewes and lambs confused,
    All unto our deaths declining.

RHYME a b a b 

    Silence, leave thy cave obscured;
    Deign a doleful swain to tender;
    Though disdains I have endured,
    Yet I am no deep offender.

RHYME a b a b 

    Phillis' son can with his finger
    Hide his scar, it is so little;
    Little sin a day to linger,
    Wise men wander in a tittle.

RHYME a b a b 

    Thriftless yet my swain have turned,
    Though my sun he never showeth:
    Though I weep, I am not mourned;
    Though I want, no pity groweth.

RHYME a b a b 

    Yet for pity love my muses;
    Gentle silence be their cover;
    They must leave their wonted uses,
    Since I leave to be a lover.

RHYME a b a b 

    They shall live with thee inclosed,
    I will loathe my pen and paper
    Art shall never be supposed,
    Sloth shall quench the watching taper.

RHYME a b a b 

    Kiss them, silence, kiss them kindly
    Though I leave them, yet I love them;
    Though my wit have led them blindly,
    Yet my swain did once approve them.

RHYME a b a b 

    I will travel soils removed,
    Night and morrow never merry;
    Thou shalt harbour that I loved,
    I will love that makes me weary.

RHYME a b a b 

    If perchance the sheep estrayeth,
    In thy walks and shades unhaunted,

      Ye heralds of my heart, mine ardent groans,
    O tears which gladly would burst out to brooks,
    Oh spent on fruitless sand my surging moans,
    Oh thoughts enthralled unto care-boding looks!
      Ah just laments of my unjust distress,
    Ah fond desires whom reason could not guide!
    Oh hopes of love that intimate redress,
    Yet prove the load-stars unto bad betide!
      When will you cease? Or shall pain never-ceasing,
    Seize oh my heart? Oh mollify your rage,
    Lest your assaults with over-swift increasing,
    Procure my death, or call on timeless age.
      What if they do? They shall but feed the fire,
      Which I have kindled by my fond desire.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Fair art thou, Phillis, ay, so fair, sweet maid,
    As nor the sun, nor I have seen more fair;
    For in thy cheeks sweet roses are embayed,
    And gold more pure than gold doth gild thy hair.
      Sweet bees have hived their honey on thy tongue,
    And Hebe spiced her nectar with thy breath;
    About thy neck do all the graces throng,
    And lay such baits as might entangle death.
      In such a breast what heart would not be thrall?
    From such sweet arms who would not wish embraces?
    At thy fair hands who wonders not at all,
    Wonder itself through ignorance embases?
      Yet natheless though wondrous gifts you call these,
    My faith is far more wonderful than all these.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Burst, burst, poor heart! Thou hast no longer hope;
    Captive mine eyes unto eternal sleep;
    Let all my senses have no further scope;
    Let death be lord of me and all my sheep!
      For Phillis hath betrothed fierce disdain,
    That makes his mortal mansion in her heart;
    And though my tongue have long time taken pain
    To sue divorce and wed her to desert,
      She will not yield, my words can have no power;
    She scorns my faith, she laughs at my sad lays,
    She fills my soul with never ceasing sour,
    Who filled the world with volumes of her praise.
      In such extremes what wretch can cease to crave
      His peace from death, who can no mercy have!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      No glory makes me glorious or glad,
    Nor pleasure may to pleasure me dispose,
    No comfort can revive my senses sad,
    Nor hope enfranchise me with one repose.
      Nor in her absence taste I one delight,
    Nor in her presence am I well content;
    Was never time gave term to my despite,
    Nor joy that dried the tears of my lament.
      Nor hold I hope of weal in memory,
    Nor have I thought to change my restless grief,
    Nor doth my conquest yield me sovereignty,
    Nor hope repose, nor confidence relief.
      For why? She sorts her frowns and favours so,
      As when I gain or lose I cannot know.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      I wage the combat with two mighty foes,
    Which are more strong than I ten thousand fold;
    The one is when thy pleasure I do lose,
    The other, when thy person I behold.
      In seeing thee a swarm of loves confound me,
    And cause my death in spite of my resist,
    And if I see thee not, thy want doth wound me,
    For in thy sight my comfort doth consist.
      The one in me continual care createth,
    The other doth occasion my desire;
    The one the edge of all my joy rebateth,
    The other makes me a phoenix in love's fire.
      So that I grieve when I enjoy your presence,
      And die for grief by reason of your absence.

RHYME a b c a b c d e d e f f 

      I'll teach thee, lovely Phillis, what love is.
    It is a vision seeming such as thou,
    That flies as fast as it assaults mine eyes;
    It is affection that doth reason miss;
      It is a shape of pleasure like to you,
    Which meets the eye, and seen on sudden dies;
    It is a doubled grief, a spark of pleasure
    Begot by vain desire. And this is love,
      Whom in our youth we count our chiefest treasure,
    In age for want of power we do reprove.
      Yea, such a power is love, whose loss is pain,
      And having got him we repent our gain.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Fair eyes, whilst fearful I your fair admire,
    By unexpressed sweetness that I gain,
    My memory of sorrow doth expire,
    And falcon-like, I tower joy's heavens amain.
      But when your suns in oceans of their glory
    Shut up their day-bright shine, I die for thought;
    So pass my joys as doth a new-played story,
    And one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught.
      So to myself I live not, but for you;
    For you I live, and you I love, but none else,
    Oh then, fair eyes, whose light I live to view,
    Or poor forlorn despised to live alone else,
      Look sweet, since from the pith of contemplation
      Love gathereth life, and living, breedeth passion.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      Not causeless were you christened, gentle flowers,
    The one of faith, the other fancy's pride;
    For she who guides both faith and fancy's power,
    In your fair colors wraps her ivory side.
      As one of you hath whiteness without stain,
    So spotless is my love and never tainted;
    And as the other shadoweth faith again,
    Such is my lass, with no fond change acquainted.
      And as nor tyrant sun nor winter weather
    May ever change sweet amaranthus' hue,
    So she though love and fortune join together,
    Will never leave to be both fair and true.
      And should I leave thee then, thou pretty elf?
      Nay, first let Damon quite forget himself.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      I feel myself endangered beyond reason,
    My death already 'twixt the cup and lip,
    Because my proud desire through cursed treason,
    Would make my hopes mount heaven, which cannot skip;
      My fancy still requireth at my hands
    Such things as are not, cannot, may not be,
    And my desire although my power withstands,
    Will give me wings, who never yet could flee.
      What then remains except my maimed soul
    Extort compassion from love-flying age,
    Or if naught else their fury may control,
    To call on death that quells affection's rage;
      Which death shall dwell with me and never fly,
      Since vain desire seeks that hope doth deny.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e e f g g f 

      I do compare unto thy youthly clear,
    Which always bides within thy flow'ring prime,
    The month of April, that bedews our clime
    With pleasant flowers, when as his showers appear.
      Before thy face shall fly false cruelty,
    Before his face the doly season fleets;
    Mild been his looks, thine eyes are full of sweets;
    Firm is his course, firm is thy loyalty.
      He paints the fields through liquid crystal showers,
    Thou paint'st my verse with Pallas, learned flowers;
    With Zephirus' sweet, breath he fills the plains,
    And thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring;
      His brows are dewed with morning's crystal spring,
      Thou mak'st my eyes with tears bemoan my pains.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g 

      Devoid of reason, thrall to foolish ire,
    I walk and chase a savage fairy still,
    Now near the flood, straight on the mounting hill,
    Now midst the woods of youth, and vain desire.
      For leash I bear a cord of careful grief;
    For brach I lead an over-forward mind;
    My hounds are thoughts, and rage despairing blind,
    Pain, cruelty, and care without relief.
      But they perceiving that my swift pursuit
    My flying fairy cannot overtake,
    With open mouths their prey on me do make,
    Like hungry hounds that lately lost their suit.
      And full of fury on their master feed,
      To hasten on my hapless death with speed.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      A thousand times to think and think the same,
    To two fair eyes to show a naked heart,
    Great thirst with bitter liquor to restrain,
    To take repast of care and crooked smart;
      To sigh full oft without relent of ire,
    To die for grief and yet conceal the tale,
    To others' will to fashion my desire,
    To pine in looks disguised through pensive-pale;
      A short dispite, a faith unfeigned true,
    To love my foe, and set my life at naught,
    With heedless eyes mine endless harms to view,
    A will to speak, a fear to tell the thought;
      To hope for all, yet for despair to die,
      Is of my life the certain destiny.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      When first sweet Phillis, whom I must adore,
    Gan with her beauties bless our wond'ring sky,
    The son of Rhea, from their fatal store
    Made all the gods to grace her majesty.
      Apollo first his golden rays among,
    Did form the beauty of her bounteous eyes;
    He graced her with his sweet melodious song,
    And made her subject of his poesies.
      The warrior Mars bequeathed her fierce disdain,
    Venus her smile, and Phoebe all her fair,
    Python his voice, and Ceres all her grain,
    The morn her locks and fingers did repair.
      Young Love, his bow, and Thetis gave her feet;
      Clio her praise, Pallas her science sweet.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g 

      I would in rich and golden-coloured rain,
    With tempting showers in pleasant sort descend
    Into fair Phillis' lap, my lovely friend,
    When sleep her sense with slumber doth restrain.
      I would be changed to a milk-white bull,
    When midst the gladsome fields she should appear,
    By pleasant fineness to surprise my dear,
    Whilst from their stalks, she pleasant flowers did pull.
      I were content to weary out my pain,
    To be Narsissus so she were a spring,
    To drown in her those woes my heart do wring.
    And more; I wish transformed to remain,
      That whilst I thus in pleasure's lap did lie,
      I might refresh desire, which else would die.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      I hope and fear, I pray and hold my peace,
    Now freeze my thoughts and straight they fry again,
    I now admire and straight my wonders cease,
    I loose my bonds and yet myself restrain;
      This likes me most that leaves me discontent,
    My courage serves and yet my heart doth fail,
    My will doth climb whereas my hopes are spent,
    I laugh at love, yet when he comes I quail;
      The more I strive, the duller bide I still.
    I would be thralled, and yet I freedom love,
    I would redress, yet hourly feed mine ill,
    I would repine, and dare not once reprove;
      And for my love I am bereft of power,
      And strengthless strive my weakness to devour.

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g 

      If so I seek the shades, I presently do see
    The god of love forsakes his bow and sit me by;
    If that I think to write, his Muses pliant be
    If so I plain my grief, the wanton boy will cry,
      If I lament his pride, he doth increase my pain;
    If tears my cheeks attaint, his cheeks are moist with moan;
    If I disclose the wounds the which my heart hath slain,
    He takes his fascia off, and wipes them dry anon.
      If so I walk the woods, the woods are his delight;
    If I myself torment, he bathes him in my blood;
    He will my soldier be if once I wend to fight,
    If seas delight, he steers my bark amidst the hood.
      In brief, the cruel god doth never from me go,
      But makes my lasting love eternal with my woe.

RHYME a b b a a c c a 

    These fierce incessant waves that stream along my face,
    Which show the certain proof of my ne'er-ceasing pains,
    Fair Phillis, are no tears that trickle from my brains;
    For why? Such streams of ruth within me find no place.
    These floods that wet my cheeks are gathered from thy grace
    And thy perfections, and from hundred thousand flowers
    Which from thy beauties spring; whereto I medley showers
    Of rose and lilies too, the colours of thy face.
   
RHYME a b b c c a 

 My love doth serve for fire, my heart the furnace is,
    The aperries of my sighs augment the burning flame,
    The limbec is mine eye that doth distil the same;
    And by how much my fire is violent and sly,
    By so much doth it cause the waters mount on high,
    That shower from out mine eyes, for to assuage my miss.

RHYME a b b a c d d c e f f e g g 

    Who lives enthralled to Cupid and his flame,
    From day to day is changed in sundry sort;
    The proof whereof myself may well report,
    Who oft transformed by him may teach the same.
    I first was turned into a wounded hart,
    That bare the bloody arrow in my side;
    Then to a swan that midst the waters glide,
    With piteous voice presaged my deadly smart;
    Eftsoons I waxed a faint and fading flower;
    Then was I made a fountain sudden dry,
    Distilling all my tears from troubled eye;
    Now am I salamander by his power,
      Living in flames, but hope ere long to be
      A voice, to talk my mistress' majesty.

RHYME a b a b c c d e d e f f 

    My matchless mistress, whose delicious eyes
    Have power to perfect nature's privy wants,
    Even when the sun in greatest pomp did rise,
    With pretty tread did press the tender plants.
      Each stalk whilst forth she stalks, to kiss her feet
      Is proud with pomp, and prodigal of sweet.
    Her fingers fair in favouring every flower
    That wooed their ivory for a wished touch,
    By chance--sweet chance!--upon a blessed hour
    Did pluck the flower where Love himself did couch.
      Where Love did couch by summer toil suppressed,
      And sought his sleeps within so sweet a nest.
  
RHYME a b a b c c d e d e f f 

  The virgin's hand that held the wanton thrall,
    Imprisoned him within the roseate leaves;
    And twixt her teats, with favour did install
    The lovely rose, where Love his rest receives.
      The lad that felt the soft and sweet so nigh,
      Drowned in delights, disdains his liberty;
    And said, let Venus seek another son,
    For here my only matchless mother is;
    From whose fair orient orbs the drink doth run,
    That deifies my state with greater bliss.
      This said, he sucked, my mistress blushing smiled,
      Since Love was both her prisoner and her child.

    Whose first-born loves at first obscured did die,
    And bred no fame but flame of base misdeem,
      Under the ensign of whose tired pen,
    Love's legions forth have masked, by others masked;
    Think how I live wronged by ill-tongued men,
    Not master of myself, to all wrongs tasked!
      Oh thou that canst, and she that may do all things,
    Support these languishing conceits that perish!
    Look on their growth; perhaps these silly small things
    May win this wordly palm, so you do cherish.
      Homer hath vowed, and I with him do vow this,
      He will and shall revive, if you allow this.

  To the richest Treasury
That e'er fill'd ambitious eye;
To the faire bright Magazin
Hath impoverisht Love's Queen;
To th' Exchequer of all honour
(All take pensions but from her);
To the taper of the thore
Which the god himselfe but bore;
To the Sea of Chaste Delight;
Let me cast the Drop I write.
  And as at Loretto's shrine
Caesar shovels in his mine,
Th' Empres spreads her carkanets,
The lords submit their coronets,

RHYME a a *

Knights their chased armes hang by,
Maids diamond-ruby fancies tye;
Whilst from the pilgrim she wears
One poore false pearl, but ten true tears:
  So among the Orient prize,
(Saphyr-onyx eulogies)
Offer'd up unto your fame,
Take my GARNET-DUBLET name,
And vouchsafe 'midst those rich joyes
(With devotion) these TOYES.

Now y' have oblieg'd the age, thy wel known worth
Is to our joy auspiciously brought forth.
Good morrow to thy son, thy first borne flame
Which, as thou gav'st it birth, stamps it a name,
That Fate and a discerning age shall set
The chiefest jewell in her coronet.

RHYME a a *

Why then needs all this paines, those season'd pens,
That standing lifeguard to a booke (kinde friends),
That with officious care thus guard thy gate,
As if thy Child were illigitimate?
Forgive their freedome, since unto their praise
They write to give, not to dispute thy bayes.

As when some glorious queen, whose pregnant wombe
Brings forth a kingdome with her first-borne Sonne,
Marke but the subjects joyfull hearts and eyes:
Some offer gold, and others sacrifice;
This slayes a lambe, that, not so rich as hee,
Brings but a dove, this but a bended knee;
And though their giftes be various, yet their sence
Speaks only this one thought, Long live the prince.

So, my best brother, if unto your name
I offer up a thin blew-burning flame,
Pardon my love, since none can make thee shine,
Vnlesse they kindle first their torch at thine.
Then as inspir'd, they boldly write, nay that,
Which their amazed lights but twinkl'd at,
And their illustrate thoughts doe voice this right,
Lucasta held their torch; thou gav'st it light.

How humble is thy muse (Deare) that can daign
Such servants as my pen to entertaine!
When all the sonnes of wit glory to be
Clad in thy muses gallant livery.
I shall disgrace my master, prove a staine,
And no addition to his honour'd traine;
Though all that read me will presume to swear
I neer read thee: yet if it may appear,
I love the writer and admire the writ,
I my owne want betray, not wrong thy wit.
Did thy worke want a prayse, my barren brain
Could not afford it: my attempt were vaine.
It needs no foyle: All that ere writ before,
Are foyles to thy faire Poems, and no more.
Then to be lodg'd in the same sheets with thine,
May prove disgrace to yours, but grace to mine.

RHYME a a *

Deare Lovelace, I am now about to prove
I cannot write a verse, but can write love.
On such a subject as thy booke I coo'd
Write books much greater, but not half so good.
But as the humble tenant, that does bring
A chicke or egges for's offering,
Is tane into the buttry, and does fox
Equall with him that gave a stalled oxe:
So (since the heart of ev'ry cheerfull giver
Makes pounds no more accepted than a stiver),
Though som thy prayse in rich stiles sing, I may
In stiver-stile write love as well as they.
I write so well that I no criticks feare;
For who'le read mine, when as thy booke's so neer,
Vnlesse thy selfe? then you shall secure mine
From those, and Ile engage my selfe for thine.
They'l do't themselves; <thee> this allay you'l take,
I love thy book, and yet not for thy sake.

RHYME a a *

So from the pregnant braine of Jove did rise
Pallas, the queene of wit and beautious eyes,
As faire Lucasta from thy temples flowes,
Temples no lesse ingenious then Joves.
Alike in birth, so shall she be in fame,
And be immortall to preserve thy Name.

Now, when the wars augment our woes and fears,
And the shrill noise of drums oppresse our ears;
Now peace and safety from our shores are fled
To holes and cavernes to secure their head;
Now all the graces from the land are sent,
And the nine Muses suffer banishment;
Whence spring these raptures? whence this heavenly rime,
So calme and even in so harsh a time?
Well might that charmer his faire Caelia crowne,
And that more polish't Tyterus renowne
His Sacarissa, when in groves and bowres
They could repose their limbs on beds of flowrs:

RHYME a a *

When wit had prayse, and merit had reward,
And every noble spirit did accord
To love the Muses, and their priests to raise,
And interpale their browes with flourishing bayes;
But in a time distracted so to sing,
When peace is hurried hence on rages wing,
When the fresh bayes are from the Temple torne,
And every art and science made a scorne;
Then to raise up, by musicke of thy art,
Our drooping spirits and our grieved hearts;
Then to delight our souls, and to inspire
Our breast with pleasure from thy charming lyre;
Then to divert our sorrowes by thy straines,
Making us quite forget our seven yeers paines

RHYME a a *

In the past wars, unlesse that Orpheus be
A sharer in thy glory: for when he

RHYME a a *

He stroke his lute with like admired art,
And made the damned to forget their smart.

RHYME a a *

He that doth paint the beauties of your verse,
Must use your pensil, be polite, soft, terse;
Forgive that man whose best of art is love,
If he no equall master to you prove.
My heart is all my eloquence, and that
Speaks sharp affection, when my words fall flat;
I reade you like my mistresse, and discry
In every line the quicknesse of her eye:
Her smoothnesse in each syllable, her grace
To marshall ev'ry word in the right place.
It is the excellence and soule of wit,
When ev'ry thing is free as well as fit:

RHYME a a *

For metaphors packt up and crowded close
Swath <ye> minds sweetnes, and display the throws,
And, like those chickens hatcht in furnaces,
Produce or one limbe more, or one limbe lesse
Then nature bids.  Survey such when they write,
No clause but's justl'd with an epithite.
So powerfully you draw when you perswade,
Passions in you in us are vertues made;
Such is the magick of that lawfull shell
That where it doth but talke, it doth compell:
  For no Apelles 'till this time e're drew
  A Venus to the waste so well as you.

The world shall now no longer mourne nor vex
For th' obliquity of a cross-grain'd sex;
Nor beauty swell above her bankes, (and made
For ornament) the universe invade
So fiercely, that 'tis question'd in our bookes,
Whether kils most the Amazon's sword or lookes.
Lucasta in loves game discreetly makes
Women and men joyntly to share the stakes,
And lets us know, when women scorne, it is
Mens hot love makes the antiparisthesis;
And a lay lover here such comfort finds
As Holy Writ gives to affected minds.

RHYME a a *

The wilder nymphs, lov's power could not comand,
Are by thy almighty numbers brought to hand,
And flying Daphnes, caught, amazed vow
They never heard Apollo court till now.
'Tis not by force of armes this feat is done,
For that would puzzle even the Knight o' th' Sun;
But 'tis by pow'r of art, and such a way
As Orpheus us'd, when he made fiends obay.

RHYME a a *

  Ovr times are much degenerate from those,
Which your sweet Muse, which your fair fortune chose;
And as complexions alter with the climes,
Our wits have drawne th' infection of our times.
That candid age no other way could tell
To be ingenious, but by speaking well.
Who best could prayse, had then the greatest prayse;
'Twas more esteemd to give then wear the bayes.
Modest ambition studi'd only then
To honour not her selfe, but worthy men.
These vertues now are banisht out of towne,
Our Civill Wars have lost the civicke crowne.
He highest builds, who with most art destroys,
And against others fame his owne employs.
I see the envious caterpillar sit
On the faire blossome of each growing wit.
  The ayre's already tainted with the swarms
Of insects, which against you rise in arms.
Word-peckers, paper-rats, book-scorpions,
Of wit corrupted the unfashion'd sons.
The barbed censurers begin to looke
Like the grim Consistory on thy booke;
And on each line cast a reforming eye
Severer then the yong presbytery.
Till, when in vaine they have thee all perus'd,
You shall for being faultlesse be accus'd.
Some reading your LUCASTA will alledge
You wrong'd in her the Houses priviledge;

RHYME a a *

Some that you under sequestration are,
Because you write when going to the Warre;
And one the book prohibits, because Kent
Their first Petition by the Authour sent.
  But when the beauteous ladies came to know,
That their deare Lovelace was endanger'd so:
Lovelace, that thaw'd the most congealed brest,
He who lov'd best, and them defended best,
Whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand,
Whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand,
They all in mutiny, though yet undrest,
Sally'd, and would in his defence contest.
And one, the loveliest that was yet e're seen,
Thinking that I too of the rout had been,
Mine eyes invaded with a female spight
(She knew what pain 't would be to lose that sight).
O no, mistake not, I reply'd: for I
In your defence, or in his cause, would dy.
But he, secure of glory and of time,
Above their envy or mine aid doth clime.
Him valianst men and fairest nymphs approve,
His booke in them finds judgement, with you, love.

RHYME a a *

  If the desire of glory speak a mind
More nobly operative and more refin'd,
What vast soule moves thee, or what hero's spirit
(Kept in'ts traduction pure) dost thou inherit,
That, not contented with one single fame,
Dost to a double glory spread thy name,
And on thy happy temples safely set
Both th' Delphick wreath and civic coronet?
  Was't not enough for us to know how far
Thou couldst in season suffer, act and dare
But we must also witnesse, with what height
And what Ionick sweetnesse thou canst write,

RHYME a a *

And melt those eager passions, that are
Stubborn enough t' enrage the god of war
Into a noble love, which may expire
In an illustrious pyramid of fire;
Which, having gained his due station, may
Fix there, and everlasting flames display.
This is the braver path: time soone can smother
The dear-bought spoils and tropheis of the other.
How many fiery heroes have there been,
Whose triumphs were as soone forgot as seen?
Because they wanted some diviner one
To rescue <thee> from night, and make <thee> known.
  Such art thou to thy selfe.  While others dream
Strong flatt'ries on a fain'd or borrow'd theam,
Thou shalt remaine in thine owne lustre bright,
And adde unto 't LUCASTA'S chaster light.
  For none so fit to sing great things as he,
That can act o're all lights of poetry.
Thus had Achilles his owne gests design'd,
He had his genius Homer far outshin'd.

RHYME a a *

  Poets and painters have some near relation,
Compar'd with fancy and imagination;
The one paints shadowed persons (in pure kind),
The other paints the pictures of the mind
In purer verse.  And as rare Zeuxes fame
Shin'd, till Apelles art eclips'd the same
By a more exquisite and curious line
In Zeuxeses (with pensill far more fine),
So have our modern poets late done well,
Till thine appear'd (which scarce have paralel).
  They like to Zeuxes grapes beguile the sense,
But thine do ravish the intelligence,
Like the rare banquet of Apelles, drawn,
And covered over with most curious lawn.

RHYME a a *

  Thus if thy careles draughts are cal'd the best,
What would thy lines have beene, had'st thou profest
That faculty (infus'd) of poetry,
Which adds such honour unto thy chivalry?
Doubtles thy verse had all as far transcended
As Sydneyes Prose, who Poets once defended.
  For when I read thy much renowned pen,
My fancy there finds out another Ben
In thy brave language, judgement, wit, and art,
Of every piece of thine, in every part:
Where thy seraphique Sydneyan fire is raised high
In valour, vertue, love, and loyalty.
  Virgil was styl'd the loftiest of all,
Ovid the smoothest and most naturall;

RHYME a a *

Martiall concise and witty, quaint and pure,
Iuvenall grave and learned, though obscure.
  But all these rare ones which I heere reherse,
Do live againe in Thee, and in thy Verse:
Although not in the language of their time,
Yet in a speech as copious and sublime.
  The rare Apelles in thy picture wee
Perceive, and in thy soule Apollo see.
Wel may each Grace and Muse then crown thy praise
With Mars his banner and Minerva's bayes.

RHYME a a *

Chast as Creation meant us, and more bright
Then the first day in 's uneclipsed light,
Is thy LUCASTA; and thou offerest heere
Lines to her name as undefil'd and cleere;
Such as the first indeed more happy dayes
(When vertue, wit, and learning wore the bayes
Now vice assumes) would to her memory give:
A Vestall flame that should for ever live,
Plac't in a christal temple, rear'd to be
The Embleme of her thoughts integrity;
And on the porch thy name insculpt, my friend,
Whose love, like to the flame, can know no end.

RHYME a a *

The marble step that to the alter brings
The hallowed priests with their clean offerings,
Shall hold their names that humbly crave to be
Votaries to th' shrine, and grateful friends to thee.
So shal we live (although our offrings prove
Meane to the world) for ever by thy love.

RHYME a a *

Ile doe my nothing too, and try
To dabble to thy memory.
Not that I offer to thy name
Encomiums of thy lasting fame.
Those by the landed have been writ:
Mine's but a yonger-brother wit;
A wit that's hudled up in scarres,
Borne like my rough selfe in the warres;
And as a Squire in the fight
Serves only to attend the Knight,
So 'tis my glory in this field,
Where others act, to beare thy shield.

  Which as a ball he boundeth
From hand to breast, from breast to lip,

And in the sleave-silke of her haire

She proab'd it with her constancie,

Only the anger of her eye

Then prest she narde in ev'ry veine,
  Which from her kisses trilled;
And with the balme heald all its paine,

When I by thy faire shape did sweare,
And mingled with each vowe a teare,
     I lov'd, I lov'd thee best,
     I swore as I profest.
For all the while you lasted warme and pure,
     My oathes too did endure.
But once turn'd faithlesse to thy selfe and old,
They then with thee incessantly grew cold.

RHYME a a *

I swore my selfe thy sacrifice
By th' ebon bowes that guard thine eyes,
     Which now are alter'd white,
     And by the glorious light
Of both those stars, which of their spheres bereft,
     Only the gellie's left.
Then changed thus, no more I'm bound to you,
Then swearing to a saint that proves untrue.

Lucasta wept, and still the bright

With his soft handkercher of light,
   Kist the wet pearles away.

RHYME a b a b 

But when her teares his heate or'ecame,
   In cloudes he quensht his beames,
And griev'd, wept out his eye of flame,
   So drowned her sad streames.

RHYME a b a b 

At this she smiled, when straight the sun
   Cleer'd by her kinde desires;
And by her eyes reflexion
   Fast kindl'd there his fires.

Long in thy shackels, liberty
I ask not from these walls, but thee;
Left for awhile anothers bride,
To fancy all the world beside.

RHYME a a *

Yet e're I doe begin to love,
See, how I all my objects prove;
Then my free soule to that confine,
'Twere possible I might call mine.

RHYME a a *

First I would be in love with PEACE,
And her rich swelling breasts increase;
But how, alas! how may that be,
Despising earth, she will love me?

RHYME a a *

Faine would I be in love with WAR,
As my deare just avenging star;
But War is lov'd so ev'rywhere,
Ev'n he disdaines a lodging here.

RHYME a a *

Thee and thy wounds I would bemoane,
Faire thorough-shot RELIGION;
But he lives only that kills thee,
And who so bindes thy hands, is free.

RHYME a a *

I would love a PARLIAMENT
As a maine prop from Heav'n sent;
But ah! who's he, that would be wedded
To th' fairest body that's beheaded?

RHYME a a *

Next would I court my LIBERTY,
And then my birth-right, PROPERTY;
But can that be, when it is knowne,
There's nothing you can call your owne?

RHYME a a *

A REFORMATION I would have,
As for our griefes a SOV'RAIGNE salve;
That is, a cleansing of each wheele
Of state, that yet some rust doth feele.

RHYME a a *

But not a reformation so,
As to reforme were to ore'throw,
Like watches by unskilfull men
Disjoynted, and set ill againe.

RHYME a a *

The PUBLICK FAITH I would adore,
But she is banke-rupt of her store:
Nor how to trust her can I see,
For she that couzens all, must me.

RHYME a a *

Since then none of these can be
Fit objects for my love and me;
What then remaines, but th' only spring
Of all our loves and joyes, the King?

RHYME a a *

He who, being the whole ball
Of day on earth, lends it to all;
When seeking to ecclipse his right,
Blinded we stand in our owne light.

RHYME a a *

And now an universall mist
Of error is spread or'e each breast,
With such a fury edg'd as is
Not found in th' inwards of th' abysse.

RHYME a a *

Oh, from thy glorious starry waine
Dispense on me one sacred beame,
To light me where I soone may see
How to serve you, and you trust me!

Eastrich! thou featherd foole, and easie prey,

Snakes through thy guttur-neck hisse all the day,

RHYME a b a b 

O what a glorious transmigration
  From this to so divine an edifice
Hast thou straight made! heere from a winged stone
  Transform'd into a bird of paradice!

RHYME a b a b 

Now doe thy plumes for hiew and luster vie
  With th' arch of heav'n that triumphs or'e past wet,
And in a rich enamel'd pinion lye
  With saphyres, amethists and opalls set.

RHYME a b a b 

Sometime they wing her side, <thee> strive to drown
  The day's eyes piercing beames, whose am'rous heat
Sollicites still, 'till with this shield of downe
  From her brave face his glowing fires are beat.

RHYME a b a b 

But whilst a plumy curtaine she doth draw,
  A chrystall mirror sparkles in thy breast,
In which her fresh aspect when as she saw,
  And then her foe retired to the west.

RHYME a b a b 

Deare engine, that oth' sun got'st me the day,
  'Spite of his hot assaults mad'st him retreat!
No wind (said she) dare with thee henceforth play
  But mine own breath to coole the tyrants heat.

RHYME a b a b 

My lively shade thou ever shalt retaine
  In thy inclosed feather-framed glasse,
And but unto our selves to all remaine
  Invisible, thou feature of this face!

RHYME a b a b 

So said, her sad swaine over-heard and cried:
  Yee Gods! for faith unstaind this a reward!
Feathers and glasse t'outweigh my vertue tryed!
  Ah! show their empty strength! the gods accord.

RHYME a b a b 

Now fall'n the brittle favourite lyes and burst!
  Amas'd LUCASTA weepes, repents and flies
To her ALEXIS, vowes her selfe acurst,

Yee happy floods! that now must passe
  The sacred conduicts of her wombe,
Smooth and transparent as your face,

RHYME a b a b 

Be proud! and if your waters be
  Foul'd with a counterfeyted teare,
Or some false sigh hath stained yee,

RHYME a b a b 

And when her rosie gates y'have trac'd,
  Continue yet some Orient wet,
'Till, turn'd into a gemme, y'are plac'd
  Like diamonds with rubies set.

RHYME a b a b

  Tell me, did you e're smell or view
On any leafe of all your flowers

RHYME a b a b 

But as through th' Organs of her breath
  You trickle wantonly, beware:
Ambitious Seas in their just death
  As well as Lovers, must have share.

RHYME a b a b 

And see! you boyle as well as I;
  You, that to coole her did aspire,
Now troubled and neglected lye,
  Nor can your selves quench your owne fire.

RHYME a b a b 

Yet still be happy in the thought,
  That in so small a time as this,
Through all the Heavens you were brought
  Of Vertue, Honour, Love and Blisse.

Ah LUCASTA, why so bright?
Spread with early streaked light!
If still vailed from our sight,
What is't but eternall night?

RHYME a a a a a 

Ah LUCASTA, why so chaste?
With that vigour, ripenes grac't,
Not to be by Man imbrac't
Makes that Royall coyne imbace't,
And this golden Orchard waste!

RHYME a a a a a 

Ah LUCASTA, why so great,
That thy crammed coffers sweat?
Yet not owner of a seat
May shelter you from Natures heat,
And your earthly joyes compleat.

RHYME a a a a a 

Ah Lucasta, why so good?
Blest with an unstained flood
Flowing both through soule and blood;
If it be not understood,
'Tis a Diamond in mud.

RHYME a a a a a 

LUCASTA! stay! why dost thou flye?
Thou art not bright but to the eye,
Nor chaste but in the mariage-tye,
Nor great but in this treasurie,
Nor good but in that sanctitie.

RHYME a a a a 

Harder then the Orient stone,
Like an apparition,
Or as a pale shadow gone,
Dumbe and deafe she hence is flowne.

RHYME a a a a a 

Then receive this equall dombe:
Virgins, strow no teare or bloome,
No one dig the Parian wombe;
Raise her marble heart i'th' roome,
And 'tis both her coarse and tombe.

RHYME a b a b 

See! what an undisturbed teare

But, viewing her, straight wak'd a Star,

RHYME a b a b 

Griefe ne're before did tyranize
  On th' honour of that brow,
And at the wheeles of her brave eyes

RHYME a b a b 

Thus, for a saints apostacy
  The unimagin'd woes
And sorrowes of the Hierarchy
  None but an angel knowes.

RHYME a b a b 

Thus, for lost soules recovery
  The clapping of all wings
And triumphs of this victory
  None but an angel sings.

RHYME a b a b 

So none but she knows to bemone
  This equal virgins fate,
None but LUCASTA can her crowne

RHYME a b a b 

Then dart on me (CHAST LIGHT) one ray,

Thy joy cleare through this cloudy day

Oh, stay that covetous hand; first turn all eye,
All depth and minde; then mystically spye

So truely copied from th' originall,
That you will sweare her body by this law
Is but its shadow, as this, its;--now draw.

RHYME a a b c b c d d 

Cold as the breath of winds that blow
To silver shot descending snow,
  Lucasta sigh't; when she did close
    The world in frosty chaines!
  And then a frowne to rubies frose
    The blood boyl'd in our veines:
Yet cooled not the heat her sphere
Of beauties first had kindled there.

RHYME a a b c b c d d 

Then mov'd, and with a suddaine flame
Impatient to melt all againe,
  Straight from her eyes she lightning hurl'd,
    And earth in ashes mournes;
  The sun his blaze denies the world,
    And in her luster burnes:
Yet warmed not the hearts, her nice
Disdaine had first congeal'd to ice.

RHYME a a b c b c d d 

And now her teares nor griev'd desire
Can quench this raging, pleasing fire;
  Fate but one way allowes; behold
    Her smiles' divinity!
  They fann'd this heat, and thaw'd that cold,
    So fram'd up a new sky.
Thus earth, from flames and ice repreev'd,
E're since hath in her sun-shine liv'd.

TITLE

RHYME a b a b a c c 

That frantick errour I adore,
  And am confirm'd the earth turns round;
Now satisfied o're and o're,
  As rowling waves, so flowes the ground,
And as her neighbour reels the shore:
  Finde such a woman says she loves;
  She's that fixt heav'n, which never moves.

RHYME a b a b a c c 

In marble, steele, or porphyrie,
  Who carves or stampes his armes or face,
Lookes it by rust or storme must dye:
  This womans love no time can raze,
Hardned like ice in the sun's eye,
  Or your reflection in a glasse,
  Which keepes possession, though you passe.

RHYME a b a b a c c 

We not behold a watches hand
  To stir, nor plants or flowers to grow;
Must we infer that this doth stand,
  And therefore, that those do not blow?
This she acts calmer, like Heav'ns brand,
  The stedfast lightning, slow loves dart,
  She kils, but ere we feele the smart.

RHYME a b a b a c c 

Oh, she is constant as the winde,
  That revels in an ev'nings aire!
Certaine as wayes unto the blinde,
  More reall then her flatt'ries are;
Gentle as chaines that honour binde,
  More faithfull then an Hebrew Jew,
  But as the divel not halfe so true.

From the dire monument of thy black roome,
Wher now that vestal flame thou dost intombe,
As in the inmost cell of all earths wombe.

Sacred Lucasta, like the pow'rfull ray
Of heavenly truth, passe this Cimmerian way,
Whilst all the standards of your beames display.

RHYME a a a 

Arise and climbe our whitest, highest hill;
There your sad thoughts with joy and wonder fill,
And see seas calme as earth, earth as your will.

RHYME a a a 

Behold! how lightning like a taper flyes,
And guilds your chari't, but ashamed dyes,
Seeing it selfe out-gloried by your eyes.

RHYME a a a 

Threatning and boystrous tempests gently bow,
And to your steps part in soft paths, when now
There no where hangs a cloud, but on your brow.

RHYME a a a 

No showrs but 'twixt your lids, nor gelid snow,
But what your whiter, chaster brest doth ow,
Whilst winds in chains colder for sorrow blow.

RHYME a a a 

Shrill trumpets doe only sound to eate,
Artillery hath loaden ev'ry dish with meate,
And drums at ev'ry health alarmes beate.

RHYME a a a 

All things Lucasta, but Lucasta, call,
Trees borrow tongues, waters in accents fall,
The aire doth sing, and fire is musicall.

RHYME a a a 

Awake from the dead vault in which you dwell,
All's loyall here, except your thoughts rebell
Which, so let loose, often their gen'rall quell.

RHYME a a a 

See! she obeys!  By all obeyed thus,
No storms, heats, colds, no soules contentious,
Nor civill war is found; I meane, to us.

Lovers and angels, though in heav'n they show,
And see the woes and discords here below,
What they not feele, must not be said to know.

RHYME a a *

  Up with the jolly bird of light
Who sounds his third retreat to night;
Faire Amarantha from her bed
Ashamed starts, and rises red
As the carnation-mantled morne,
Who now the blushing robe doth spurne,
And puts on angry gray, whilst she,
The envy of a deity,
Arayes her limbes, too rich indeed
To be inshrin'd in such a weed;
Yet lovely 'twas and strait, but fit;
Not made for her, but she to it:
By nature it sate close and free,
As the just bark unto the tree:
Unlike Love's martyrs of the towne,
All day imprison'd in a gown,
Who, rackt in silke 'stead of a dresse,
Are cloathed in a frame or presse,
And with that liberty and room,
The dead expatiate in a tombe.
  No cabinets with curious washes,
Bladders and perfumed plashes;

RHYME a a *

No venome-temper'd water's here,
Mercury is banished this sphere:
Her payle's all this, in which wet glasse
She both doth cleanse and view her face.
  Far hence, all Iberian smells,
Hot amulets, Pomander spells,
Fragrant gales, cool ay'r, the fresh
And naturall odour of her flesh,
Proclaim her sweet from th' wombe as morne.
Those colour'd things were made, not borne.
Which, fixt within their narrow straits,
Do looke like their own counterfeyts.
So like the Provance rose she walkt,
Flowerd with blush, with verdure stalkt;
Th' officious wind her loose hayre curles,
The dewe her happy linnen purles,
But wets a tresse, which instantly
Sol with a crisping beame doth dry.

RHYME a a *

  Into the garden is she come,
Love and delight's Elisium;
If ever earth show'd all her store,
View her discolourd budding floore;
Here her glad eye she largely feedes,
And stands 'mongst them, as they 'mong weeds;
The flowers in their best aray
As to their queen their tribute pay,
And freely to her lap proscribe
A daughter out of ev'ry tribe.
Thus as she moves, they all bequeath
At once the incense of their breath.

RHYME a a *

  The noble Heliotropian
Now turnes to her, and knowes no sun.
  And as her glorious face doth vary,
So opens loyall golden Mary
Who, if but glanced from her sight,
Straight shuts again, as it were night.
The violet (else lost ith' heap)
Doth spread fresh purple for each step,
With whose humility possest,
Sh' inthrones the Poore Girle in her breast:
The July-flow'r that hereto thriv'd,
Knowing her self no longer-liv'd,
But for one look of her upheaves,
Then 'stead of teares straight sheds her leaves.

RHYME a a *

  Now the rich robed Tulip who,
Clad all in tissue close, doth woe
Her (sweet to th' eye but smelling sower),
She gathers to adorn her bower.
  But the proud Hony-suckle spreads
Like a pavilion her heads,
Contemnes the wanting commonalty,
That but to two ends usefull be,
And to her lips thus aptly plac't,
With smell and hue presents her tast.
  So all their due obedience pay,
Each thronging to be in her way:
Faire Amarantha with her eye
Thanks those that live, which else would dye:
The rest, in silken fetters bound,
By crowning her are crown and crown'd.
  And now the sun doth higher rise,
Our Flora to the meadow hies:

RHYME a a *

The poore distressed heifers low,
And as sh' approacheth gently bow,
Begging her charitable leasure
To strip them of their milkie treasure.
  Out of the yeomanry oth' heard,
With grave aspect, and feet prepar'd,
A rev'rend lady-cow drawes neare,
Bids Amarantha welcome here;
And from her privy purse lets fall
A pearle or two, which seeme[s] to call
This adorn'd adored fayry
To the banquet of her dayry.
  Soft Amarantha weeps to see
'Mongst men such inhumanitie,
That those, who do receive in hay,
And pay in silver twice a day,
Should by their cruell barb'rous theft
Be both of that and life bereft.
  But 'tis decreed, when ere this dies,
That she shall fall a sacrifice
Unto the gods, since those, that trace
Her stemme, show 'tis a god-like race,
Descending in an even line
From heifers and from steeres divine,
Making the honour'd extract full
In Io and Europa's bull.
She was the largest goodliest beast,
That ever mead or altar blest;
Round [w]as her udder, and more white
Then is the Milkie Way in night;
Her full broad eye did sparkle fire;
Her breath was sweet as kind desire,
And in her beauteous crescent shone,
Bright as the argent-horned moone.

RHYME a a *

  But see! this whiteness is obscure,
Cynthia spotted, she impure;
Her body writheld, and her eyes
Departing lights at obsequies:
Her lowing hot to the fresh gale,
Her breath perfumes the field withall;
To those two suns that ever shine,
To those plump parts she doth inshrine,
To th' hovering snow of either hand,
That love and cruelty command.
  After the breakfast on her teat,
She takes her leave oth' mournfull neat
Who, by her toucht, now prizeth her life,
Worthy alone the hollowed knife.
  Into the neighbring wood she's gone,
Whose roofe defies the tell-tale Sunne,
And locks out ev'ry prying beame;
Close by the lips of a cleare streame,
She sits and entertaines her eye
With the moist chrystall and the frye
With burnisht-silver mal'd, whose oares
Amazed still make to the shoares;
What need she other bait or charm,
What hook or angle, but her arm?
The happy captive, gladly ta'n,
Sues ever to be slave in vaine,
Who instantly (confirm'd in's feares)
Hasts to his element of teares.
  From hence her various windings roave
To a well-orderd stately grove;

RHYME a a *

This is the pallace of the wood
And court oth' Royall Oake, where stood
The whole nobility: the Pine,
Strait Ash, tall Firre, and wanton Vine;
The proper Cedar, and the rest.
Here she her deeper senses blest;
Admires great Nature in this pile,
Floor'd with greene-velvet Camomile,
Garnisht with gems of unset fruit,
Supply'd still with a self recruit;
Her bosom wrought with pretty eyes
Of never-planted Strawberries;
Where th' winged musick of the ayre
Do richly feast, and for their fare,
Each evening in a silent shade,
Bestow a gratefull serenade.
  Thus ev'n tyerd with delight,
Sated in soul and appetite;
Full of the purple Plumme and Peare,
The golden Apple, with the faire
Grape that mirth fain would have taught her,
And nuts, which squirrells cracking brought her;
She softly layes her weary limbs,
Whilst gentle slumber now beginnes
To draw the curtaines of her eye;
When straight awakend with a crie
And bitter groan, again reposes,
Again a deep sigh interposes.
And now she heares a trembling voyce:
Ah! can there ought on earth rejoyce!
Why weares she this gay livery,
Not black as her dark entrails be?

RHYME a a *

Can trees be green, and to the ay'r
Thus prostitute their flowing hayr?
Why do they sprout, not witherd dy?
Must each thing live, save wretched I?
Can dayes triumph in blew and red,
When both their light and life is fled?
Fly Joy on wings of Popinjayes
To courts of fools, where as your playes
Dye laught at and forgot; whilst all
That's good mourns at this funerall.
Weep, all ye Graces, and you sweet
Quire, that at the hill inspir'd meet:
Love, put thy tapers out, that we
And th' world may seem as blind as thee;
And be, since she is lost (ah wound!)
Not Heav'n it self by any found.
  Now as a prisoner new cast,
Who sleepes in chaines that night, his last,
Next morn is wak't with a repreeve,
And from his trance, not dream bid live,
Wonders (his sence not having scope)
Who speaks, his friend or his false hope.
  So Amarantha heard, but feare
Dares not yet trust her tempting care;
And as againe her arms oth' ground
Spread pillows for her head, a sound
More dismall makes a swift divorce,
And starts her thus:----Rage, rapine, force!
Ye blew-flam'd daughters oth' abysse,
Bring all your snakes, here let them hisse;

RHYME a a *

Let not a leaf its freshnesse keep;
Blast all their roots, and as you creepe,
And leave behind your deadly slime,
Poyson the budding branch in's prime:
Wast the proud bowers of this grove,
That fiends may dwell in it, and move
As in their proper hell, whilst she
Above laments this tragedy:
Yet pities not our fate; oh faire
Vow-breaker, now betroth'd to th' ay'r!
Why by those lawes did we not die,
As live but one, Lucasta! why----
As he Lucasta nam'd, a groan
Strangles the fainting passing tone;
But as she heard, Lucasta smiles,
Posses her round; she's slipt mean whiles
Behind the blind of a thick bush,
When, each word temp'ring with a blush,
She gently thus bespake; Sad swaine,
If mates in woe do ease our pain,
Here's one full of that antick grief,
Which stifled would for ever live,
But told, expires; pray then, reveale
(To show our wound is half to heale),
What mortall nymph or deity
Bewail you thus?  Who ere you be,
The shepheard sigh't, my woes I crave
Smotherd in me, me in my grave;
Yet be in show or truth a saint,
Or fiend, breath anthemes, heare my plaint,
For her and thy breath's symphony,
Which now makes full the harmony

Above, and to whose voice the spheres
Listen, and call her musick theirs;
This was I blest on earth with, so
As Druids amorous did grow,
Jealous of both: for as one day
This star, as yet but set in clay,

RHYME a a *

They steept her in the hollowed brooke,
Which from her humane nature tooke,
And straight to heaven with winged feare,
Thus, ravisht with her, ravish her.
  The nymph reply'd: This holy rape
Became the gods, whose obscure shape
They cloth'd with light, whilst ill you grieve
Your better life should ever live,

RHYME a a *

And weep that she, to whom you wish
What heav'n could give, has all its blisse.
Calling her angell here, yet be
Sad at this true divinity:
She's for the altar, not the skies,
Whom first you crowne, then sacrifice.
  Fond man thus to a precipice
Aspires, till at the top his eyes
Have lost the safety of the plain,
Then begs of Fate the vales againe.
  The now confounded shepheard cries:
Ye all-confounding destines!
How did you make that voice so sweet
Without that glorious form to it?
Thou sacred spirit of my deare,
Where e're thou hoverst o're us, hear!
Imbark thee in the lawrell tree,
And a new Phebus follows thee,
Who, 'stead of all his burning rayes,
Will strive to catch thee with his layes;

RHYME a a *

Or, if within the Orient Vine,
Thou art both deity and wine;
But if thou takest the mirtle grove,
That Paphos is, thou, Queene of Love,
And I, thy swain who (else) must die,
By no beasts, but thy cruelty:
But you are rougher than the winde.
Are souls on earth then heav'n more kind?
Imprisoned in mortality
Lucasta would have answered me.
Lucasta, Amarantha said,
Is she that virgin-star? a maid,
Except her prouder livery,
In beauty poore, and cheap as I;
Whose glory like a meteor shone,
Or aery apparition,
Admir'd a while, but slighted known.
  Fierce, as the chafed lyon hies,
He rowses him, and to her flies,
Thinking to answer with his speare----
  Now, as in warre intestine where,
Ith' mist of a black battell, each
Layes at his next, then makes a breach
Through th' entrayles of another, whom
He sees nor knows whence he did come,
Guided alone by rage and th' drumme,
But stripping and impatient wild,
He finds too soon his onely child.
  So our expiring desp'rate lover
Far'd when, amaz'd, he did discover

RHYME a a *

Lucasta in this nymph; his sinne
Darts the accursed javelin
'Gainst his own breast, which she puts by
With a soft lip and gentle eye,
Then closes with him on the ground
And now her smiles have heal'd his wound.

RHYME a a *

But not untill those heavy crimes
She hath kis'd off a thousand times,
Who not contented with this pain,
Doth threaten to offend again.
  And now they gaze, and sigh, and weep,
Whilst each cheek doth the other's steep,
Whilst tongues, as exorcis'd, are calm;
Onely the rhet'rick of the palm
Prevailing pleads, untill at last
They[re] chain'd in one another fast.
Lucasta to him doth relate
Her various chance and diffring fate:
How chac'd by Hydraphil, and tract
The num'rous foe to Philanact,

RHYME a a *

Who whilst they for the same things fight,
As Bards decrees and Druids rite,
For safeguard of their proper joyes
And shepheards freedome, each destroyes
The glory of this Sicilie;
Since seeking thus the remedie,
They fancy (building on false ground)
The means must them and it confound,
Yet are resolved to stand or fall,
And win a little, or lose all.

RHYME a a *

  From this sad storm of fire and blood
She fled to this yet living wood;
Where she 'mongst savage beasts doth find
Her self more safe then humane kind.
  Then she relates, how Caelia--
The lady--here strippes her array,
And girdles her in home-spunne bayes
Then makes her conversant in layes
Of birds, and swaines more innocent,
That kenne not guile [n]or courtship ment.

RHYME a a *

  Now walks she to her bow'r to dine
Under a shade of Eglantine,
Upon a dish of Natures cheere
Which both grew, drest and serv'd up there:
That done, she feasts her smell with po'ses
Pluckt from the damask cloath of Roses.
Which there continually doth stay,
And onely frost can take away;
Then wagers which hath most content
Her eye, eare, hand, her gust or sent.
  Intranc't Alexis sees and heares,
As walking above all the spheres:
Knows and adores this, and is wilde,
Untill with her he live thus milde.
So that, which to his thoughts he meant
For losse of her a punishment,
His armes hung up and his sword broke,
His ensignes folded, he betook
Himself unto the humble crook.
And for a full reward of all,
She now doth him her shepheard call,
And in a see of flow'rs install:
Then gives her faith immediately,
Which he returns religiously;

RHYME a a *

Both vowing in her peacefull cave
To make their bridall-bed and grave.
  But the true joy this pair conceiv'd,
Each from the other first bereav'd,
And then found, after such alarmes,
Fast-pinion'd in each other's armes,
Ye panting virgins, that do meet
Your loves within their winding sheet,
Breathing and constant still ev'n there;
Or souls their bodies in yon' sphere,
Or angels, men return'd from hell
And separated mindes--can tell.

RHYME a a *

If in me anger, or disdaine
In you, or both, made me refraine
From th' noble intercourse of verse,
That only vertuous thoughts rehearse;
  Then, chaste Ellinda, might you feare
  The sacred vowes that I did sweare.

RHYME a a *

But if alone some pious thought
Me to an inward sadnesse brought,
Thinking to breath your soule too welle,
My tongue was charmed with that spell;
  And left it (since there was no roome
  To voyce your worth enough) strooke dumbe.

RHYME a a *

So then this silence doth reveal
No thought of negligence, but zeal:
For, as in adoration,
This is love's true devotion;
  Children and fools the words repeat,
  But anch'rites pray in tears and sweat.

RHYME a b a b b 

But grieve not, pretty Ermin cabinet,

The slender turnings of thy narrow roome,
But must ejected be by his owne dombe?

RHYME a b a b b 

Then give me leave to leave my rent with thee:

For peason, chickens, sawces high,
Pig, and the widdow-venson-pye;
With certaine promise (to your brother)
Of the virginity of another,
Where it is thought I too may peepe in
With knuckles far as any deepe in;
For glasses, heads, hands, bellies full

Whether all of, or more behind--a
Thankes freest, freshest, faire Ellinda.

Thankes for my visit not disdaining,
Or at the least thankes for your feigning;

To pregnant sister in prime beauty,
Whom well I deeme (e're few months elder)

In each respect but the misfortune,
Fortune, Fate, I thee importune.

  Nor must I passe the lovely Alice,
Whose health I'd quaffe in golden chalice;

Who yesterday to save his sister
Had slaine the snake, had he not mist her:
But I shall leave him, 'till a nag on

Fill with his deeds twelve reames of paper,
That Amadis, Sir Guy, and Topaz
With his fleet neigher shall keep no-pace.

  It was Amyntor's Grove, that Chloris
For ever ecchoes, and her glories;
Chloris, the gentlest sheapherdesse,
That ever lawnes and lambes did blesse;
Her breath, like to the whispering winde,
Was calme as thought, sweet as her minde;
Her lips like coral gates kept in
The perfume and the pearle within;
Her eyes a double-flaming torch
That alwayes shine, and never scorch;
Her selfe the Heav'n in which did meet
The all of bright, of faire and sweet.
  Here was I brought with that delight
That seperated soules take flight;
And when my reason call'd my sence
Back somewhat from this excellence,

RHYME a a *

That I could see, I did begin
T' observe the curious ordering
Of every roome, where 'ts hard to know,
Which most excels in sent or show.
Arabian gummes do breathe here forth,
And th' East's come over to the North;
The windes have brought their hyre of sweet
To see Amyntor Chloris greet;
Balme and nard, and each perfume,
To blesse this payre, chafe and consume;
And th' Phoenix, see! already fries!
Her neast a fire in Chloris eyes!
  Next the great and powerful hand
Beckens my thoughts unto a stand
Of Titian, Raphael, Georgone
Whose art even Nature hath out-done;
For if weake Nature only can
Intend, not perfect, what is man,
These certainely we must prefer,
Who mended what she wrought, and her;

RHYME a a *

And sure the shadowes of those rare
And kind incomparable fayre
Are livelier, nobler company,
Then if they could or speake, or see:
For these I aske without a tush,
Can kisse or touch without a blush,
And we are taught that substance is,
If uninjoy'd, but th' shade of blisse.
  Now every saint cleerly divine,
Is clos'd so in her severall shrine;
The gems so rarely, richly set,
For them wee love the cabinet;

RHYME a a *

So intricately plac't withall,
As if th' imbrordered the wall,
So that the pictures seem'd to be
But one continued tapistrie.
  After this travell of mine eyes
We sate, and pitied Dieties;
Wee bound our loose hayre with the vine,
The poppy, and the eglantine;
One swell'd an oriental bowle
Full, as a grateful, loyal soule
To Chloris!  Chloris!  Heare, oh, heare!
'Tis pledg'd above in ev'ry sphere.
  Now streight the Indians richest prize
Is kindled in glad sacrifice;
Cloudes are sent up on wings of thyme,
Amber, pomgranates, jessemine,
And through our earthen conduicts sore
Higher then altars fum'd before.
  So drencht we our oppressing cares,
And choakt the wide jawes of our feares.
Whilst ravisht thus we did devise,
If this were not a Paradice
In all, except these harmlesse sins:
Behold! flew in two cherubins,
Cleare as the skye from whence they came,
And brighter than the sacred flame;
The boy adorn'd with modesty,
Yet armed so with majesty,
That if the Thunderer againe
His eagle sends, she stoops in vaine.

Besides his innocence he tooke
A sword and casket, and did looke
Like Love in armes; he wrote but five,
Yet spake eighteene; each grace did strive,
And twenty Cupids thronged forth,
Who first should shew his prettier worth.
But oh, the Nymph!  Did you ere know
Carnation mingled with snow?
Or have you seene the lightning shrowd,
And straight breake through th' opposing cloud?
So ran her blood; such was its hue;
So through her vayle her bright haire flew,
And yet its glory did appeare
But thinne, because her eyes were neere.
  Blooming boy, and blossoming mayd,
May your faire sprigges be neere betray'd

RHYME a a *

To eating worme or fouler storme;
No serpent lurke to do them harme;
No sharpe frost cut, no North-winde teare,
The verdure of that fragrant hayre;
But may the sun and gentle weather,
When you are both growne ripe together,
Load you with fruit, such as your Father
From you with all the joyes doth gather:
And may you, when one branch is dead,
Graft such another in its stead,
Lasting thus ever in your prime,
'Till th' sithe is snatcht away from Time.

Have I not lov'd thee much and long,
  A tedious twelve moneths space?
I should all other beauties wrong,

RHYME a b a b b 

Not but all joy in thy browne haire
  In others may be found;

MINERVA in epitomy,
Whom VENUS, at first blush, surpris'd,
Tooke for her winged wagge disguis'd.
But viewing then, whereas she made
Not a distrest, but lively shade
Of ECCHO whom he had betrayd,
Now wanton, and ith' coole oth' Sunne
With her delight a hunting gone,
And thousands more, whom he had slaine;
To live and love, belov'd againe:
Ah! this is true divinity!

RHYME a a *

Then markt she SYRINX running fast
To Pan's imbraces, with the haste
Shee fled him once, whose reede-pipe rent
He finds now a new Instrument.
THESEUS return'd invokes the Ayre
And windes, then wafts his faire;
Whilst ARIADNE ravish't stood
Half in his armes, halfe in the flood.
  Proud ANAXERETE doth fall
At IPHIS feete, who smiles at all:
And he (whilst she his curles doth deck)
Hangs no where now, but on her neck.
Here PHOEBUS with a beame untombes
Long-hid LEUCOTHOE, and doomes
Her father there; DAPHNE the faire
Knowes now no bayes but round her haire;

RHYME a a *

And to APOLLO and his Sons,
Who pay him their due Orisons,
Bequeaths her lawrell-robe, that flame
Contemnes, Thunder and evill Fame.
  There kneel'd ADONIS fresh as spring,
Gay as his youth, now offering
Herself those joyes with voice and hand,
Which first he could not understand.
  Transfixed VENUS stood amas'd,
Full of the Boy and Love, she gaz'd,
And in imbraces seemed more
Senceless and colde then he before.
Uselesse Childe!  In vaine (said she)
You beare that fond artillerie;
See heere a pow'r above the slow
Weake execution of thy bow.
  So said, she riv'd the wood in two,
Unedged all his arrowes too,

RHYME a a *

And with the string their feathers bound
To that part, whence we have our wound.
  See, see! the darts by which we burn'd
Are bright Loysa's pencills turn'd,
With which she now enliveth more
Beauties, than they destroy'd before.

So truely blest, to be so curst by thee:
But oh! my cries to that doe rather adde,
Of which too much already thou hast had,
And thou art gladly sad to heare my moane;
Yet sadly hearst me with derision.

One breath yet longer, and to will, and see

That thou, which proudly tramplest on my grave,
Thyselfe mightst fall, conquer'd my double slave:
That thou mightst, sinking in thy triumphs, moan,
And I triumph in my destruction.

Where each pale guest stands fixt a living tombe;
With trembling hands helpe to remove this earth

On your white roabe 'twixt fifty and fifteene;
But as it in your swathing-bands was given,
Bring't in your winding sheet unsoyl'd to Heav'n.
Daere to do purely, without compact good,

Where round you love and joy for ever shine.

And celebrate your owne sad funerall:

As cold is in this house of clay:

As all things, crumble into dust,
And though you finde this faire-built tombe

And her eternall fame be read,
When all but VERY VERTUE'S DEAD.

And the bright ruby was but one red blot;
Thou dost the things Orientally the same
Not only paintst its colour, but its flame:

RHYME a a *

Thou sorrow canst designe without a teare,
And with the man his very hope or feare;
So that th' amazed world shall henceforth finde
None but my LILLY ever drew a MINDE.

RHYME a a *

  With that delight the Royal captiv's brought
Before the throne, to breath his farewell thought,
To tel his last tale, and so end with it,
Which gladly he esteemes a benefit;
When the brave victor, at his great soule dumbe,
Findes something there fate cannot overcome,
Cals the chain'd prince, and by his glory led,
First reaches him his crowne, and then his head;
Who ne're 'til now thinks himself slave and poor;
For though nought else, he had himselfe before.
He weepes at this faire chance, nor wil allow,
But that the diadem doth brand his brow,

RHYME a a *

And under-rates himselfe below mankinde,
Who first had lost his body, now his minde,

RHYME a a *

  With such a joy came I to heare my dombe,
And haste the preparation of my tombe,
When, like good angels who have heav'nly charge
To steere and guide mans sudden giddy barge,
She snatcht me from the rock I was upon,
And landed me at life's pavillion:
Where I, thus wound out of th' immense abysse,
Was straight set on a pinacle of blisse.

RHYME a a *

  Let me leape in againe! and by that fall
Bring me to my first woe, so cancel all:
Ah! 's this a quitting of the debt you owe,
To crush her and her goodnesse at one blowe?
  Defend me from so foule impiety,
Would make friends grieve, and furies weep to see.

RHYME a a *

  Now, ye sage spirits, which infuse in men
That are oblidg'd twice to oblige agen,
Informe my tongue in labour what to say,
And in what coyne or language to repay.
But you are silent as the ev'nings ayre,
When windes unto their hollow grots repaire.
  Oh, then accept the all that left me is,
Devout oblations of a sacred wish!

RHYME a a *

  When she walks forth, ye perfum'd wings oth' East,
Fan her, 'til with the Sun she hastes to th' West,
And when her heav'nly course calles up the day,
And breakes as bright, descend, some glistering ray,
To circle her, and her as glistering haire,
That all may say a living saint shines there.

RHYME a a *

Slow Time, with woollen feet make thy soft pace,
And leave no tracks ith' snow of her pure face;
But when this vertue must needs fall, to rise
The brightest constellation in the skies;
When we in characters of fire shall reade,
How cleere she was alive, how spotless, dead.
All you that are a kinne to piety:
For onely you can her close mourners be,
Draw neer, and make of hallowed teares a dearth:
Goodnes and justice both are fled the earth.

RHYME a a *

  If this be to be thankful, I'v a heart
Broaken with vowes, eaten with grateful smart,
And beside this, the vild world nothing hath
Worth anything but her provoked wrath;
So then, who thinkes to satisfie in time,
Must give a satisfaction for that crime:
Since she alone knowes the gifts value, she
Can onely to her selfe requitall be,

RHYME a a *

And worthyly to th' life paynt her owne story
In its true colours and full native glory;
Which when perhaps she shal be heard to tell,
Buffoones and theeves, ceasing to do ill,
Shal blush into a virgin-innocence,
And then woo others from the same offence;
The robber and the murderer, in 'spite
Of his red spots, shal startle into white:
All good (rewards layd by) shal stil increase
For love of her, and villany decease;
Naught be ignote, not so much out of feare
Of being punisht, as offending her.

RHYME a a *

  So that, when as my future daring bayes
Shall bow it selfe in lawrels to her praise,
To crown her conqu'ring goodnes, and proclaime
The due renowne and glories of her name:
My wit shal be so wretched and so poore
That, 'stead of praysing, I shal scandal her,
And leave, when with my purest art I'v done,
Scarce the designe of what she is begunne:
Yet men shal send me home, admir'd, exact;
Proud, that I could from her so wel detract.

RHYME a a *

  Where, then, thou bold instinct, shal I begin
My endlesse taske?  To thanke her were a sin
Great as not speake, and not to speake, a blame
Beyond what's worst, such as doth want a name;
So thou my all, poore gratitude, ev'n thou
In this wilt an unthankful office do:

RHYME a a *

Or wilt I fling all at her feet I have:
My life, my love, my very soule, a slave?
Tye my free spirit onely unto her,
And yeeld up my affection prisoner?
Fond thought, in this thou teachest me to give
What first was hers, since by her breath I live;
And hast but show'd me, how I may resigne
Possession of those thing are none of mine.

If you meane HER, the very HER,
Abstracted from her caracter,
Unhappy boy! you may as soone
With fawning wanton with the Moone,
Or with an amorous complaint
Get prostitute your very saint;

Such as alone doth blesse the spheres,

Tooke you the world a little in your way?

Aspiredst for the everlasting crowne?

  Ah! holy traytour to your brother prince,
Rob'd of his birth-right and preheminence!
Could you ascend yon' chaire of state e're him,
And snatch from th' heire the starry diadem?
Making your honours now as much uneven,
As gods on earth are lesse then saints in heav'n.

  Triumph! sing triumphs, then!  Oh, put on all
Your richest lookes, drest for this festivall!
Thoughts full of ravisht reverence, with eyes
So fixt, as when a saint we canonize;
Clap wings with Seraphins before the throne
At this eternall coronation,
And teach your soules new mirth, such as may be
Worthy this birth-day to divinity.

RHYME a a *

  But ah! these blast your feasts, the jubilies
We send you up are sad, as were our cries,
And of true joy we can expresse no more
Thus crown'd, then when we buried thee before.

Resigne our office to the HIERARCHY.

  Heare ye, foul speakers, that pronounce the aire
Of stewes and shores, I will informe you where
And how to cloath aright your wanton wit,
Without her nasty bawd attending it:
View here a loose thought sayd with such a grace,
Minerva might have spoke in Venus face;
So well disguis'd, that 'twas conceiv'd by none
But Cupid had Diana's linnen on;
And all his naked parts so vail'd, th' expresse

Wanting thy active and correcting fire,

Yet all men henceforth be afraid to write.

LUCASTA (fair, but hapless maid!)
Once flourisht underneath the shade
Of your illustrious Mother; now,
An orphan grown, she bows to you!
To you, her vertues' noble heir;
Oh may she find protection there!

RHYME a a *

Nor let her welcome be the less,
'Cause a rough hand makes her address:
One (to whom foes the Muses are)
Born and bred up in rugged war:
For, conscious how unfit I am,
I only have pronounc'd her name
To waken pity in your brest,
And leave her tears to plead the rest.

RHYME a b a b c d c d 

LUCASTA, frown, and let me die,
  But smile, and see, I live;
The sad indifference of your eye
  Both kills and doth reprieve.
You hide our fate within its screen;
  We feel our judgment, ere we hear.
So in one picture I have seen
  An angel here, the devil there.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

Introth, I do my self perswade,
  That the wilde boy is grown a man,
And all his childishnesse off laid,
  E're since LUCASTA did his fires fan;
    H' has left his apish jigs,
    And whipping hearts like gigs:
  For t' other day I heard him swear,
That beauty should be crown'd in honours chair.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

With what a true and heavenly state
  He doth his glorious darts dispence,
Now cleans'd from falsehood, blood and hate,
  And newly tipt with innocence!
    Love Justice is become,
    And doth the cruel doome;
  Reversed is the old decree;
Behold! he sits inthron'd with majestie.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

Inthroned in LUCASTA'S eye,
  He doth our faith and hearts survey;
Then measures them by sympathy,
  And each to th' others breast convey;
    Whilst to his altars now
    The frozen vestals bow,
  And strickt Diana too doth go
A-hunting with his fear'd, exchanged bow.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

Th' imbracing seas and ambient air
  Now in his holy fires burn;
Fish couple, birds and beasts in pair
  Do their own sacrifices turn.

    That might religion swell;
  But she, that these and their god awes,
Her crowned self submits to her own laws.

RHYME a a b b b 

Twas not for some calm blessing to deceive,
Thou didst thy polish'd hands in shagg'd furs weave;

Then let thy warm driven snow be ever stain'd.

RHYME a a b b b 

Not that you feared the discolo'ring cold
Might alchymize their silver into gold;

Each in her coarse hair smock of discipline.

RHYME a a b b b 

Nor, Hero-like who, on their crest still wore
A lyon, panther, leopard, or a bore,
  To looke their enemies in their herse,

And, in its softness rough, appear more fierce.

RHYME a a b b b 

No, no, LUCASTA, destiny decreed,
That beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed,
  And strip themselves to make you gay:
  For ne'r yet herald did display
A coat, where SABLES upon ERMIN lay.

RHYME a a b b b

Salute the threshold, and admire no more;

     By patching that which is a perfect face:

Like the dark front of some Ethiopian queen,
Vailed all ore with gems of red, blew, green,
Whose ugly night seem'd masked with days skreen.

To saphyrs, 'stead of veins and arteries,
And bow'd unto the diamonds, not her eyes.

A sun intire is her complexion,

Her look doth universal Nature cheer;
Only a cloud or two hangs here and there.

Down with thy double load of that one grain!
It is a granarie for all thy train.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Cease, large example of wise thrift, awhile

Whilst thy unpay'd musicians, crickets, sing.

And to save now, th'art worse than prodigal.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Austere and cynick! not one hour t' allow,
  To lose with pleasure, what thou gotst with pain;
But drive on sacred festivals thy plow,
  Tearing high-ways with thy ore-charged wain.
Not all thy life-time one poor minute live,
And thy ore-labour'd bulk with mirth relieve?

RHYME a b a b c c 

Look up then, miserable ant, and spie
  Thy fatal foes, for breaking of their law,
Hov'ring above thee: Madam MARGARET PIE:

Thy self and storehouse now they do store up,
And thy whole harvest too within their crop.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Thus we unt[h]rifty thrive within earth's tomb
  For some more rav'nous and ambitious jaw:
The grain in th' ant's, the ant in the pie's womb,

So scattering to hord 'gainst a long day,
Thinking to save all, we cast all away.

Not all the arms the god of fire ere made
Can the soft bulwarks of nak'd love invade.

RHYME a a *

  Those only that are poor in wit.
She that a clinquant outside doth adore,
Dotes on a gilded statue and no more.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

Love never was well-willer
  Unto my nag or mee,
Ne'r watter'd us ith' cellar,

Should a true noble master
Still make his guest his taster.

See, all the world how't staggers,
  More ugly drunk then we,
As if far gone in daggers

Which nought but sweets discloses:
Then in our loyal chamber
Refresh us with love's amber.

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

Now tell me, thou fair cripple,
  That dumb canst scarcely see
Th' almightinesse of tipple,

Still drinking and still kissing;
Adoring plump October;
Lord! what is man, and sober?

RHYME a b a b c c d d 

Now, is there such a trifle
  As honour, the fools gyant,
What is there left to rifle,
  When wine makes all parts plyant?

In their false riches wallow,
And with their grief be merry:
Leave me but love and sherry.

Thrice happy was that golden age,
When complement was constru'd rage,
  And fine words in the center hid;
When cursed NO stain'd no maid's blisse,
And all discourse was summ'd in YES,
  And nought forbad, but to forbid.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Love then unstinted love did sip,
And cherries pluck'd fresh from the lip,
  On cheeks and roses free he fed;
Lasses, like Autumne plums, did drop,
And lads indifferently did drop
  A flower and a maiden-head.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Then unconfined each did tipple
Wine from the bunch, milk from the nipple;

  Nor suits of trespasse did they fear.

Each humble princesse then did dwell
  In the Piazza of her hair.

Both broken faith and th' cause of it,
All-damning gold, was damn'd to th' pit;
  Their troth seal'd with a clasp and kisse,
Lasted until that extreem day,
In which they smil'd their souls away,
  And in each other breath'd new blisse.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Because no fault, there was no tear;
No grone did grate the granting ear,
  No false foul breath, their del'cat smell.
No serpent kiss poyson'd the tast,
Each touch was naturally chast,
  And their mere Sense a Miracle.

Naked as their own innocence,
And unembroyder'd from offence,
  They went, above poor riches, gay;
On softer than the cignet's down,
In beds they tumbled off their own:
  For each within the other lay.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Thus did they live: thus did they love,
Repeating only joyes above,
  And angels were but with cloaths on,
Which they would put off cheerfully,
To bathe them in the Galaxie,
  Then gird them with the heavenly zone.

RHYME a a b c c b 

Now, Chloris! miserably crave
The offer'd blisse you would not have,
  Which evermore I must deny:
Whilst ravish'd with these noble dreams,
And crowned with mine own soft beams,
  Injoying of my self I lye.

  And why an honour'd ragged shirt, that shows,
Like tatter'd ensigns, all its bodie's blows?
Should it be swathed in a vest so dire,
It were enough to set the child on fire;
Dishevell'd queen[s] should strip them of their hair,
And in it mantle the new rising heir:
Nor do I know ought worth to wrap it in,
Except my parchment upper-coat of skin;
And then expect no end of its chast tears,
That first was rowl'd in down, now furs of bears.

  But since to ladies 't hath a custome been
Linnen to send, that travail and lye in;
To the nine sempstresses, my former friends,

At last, the jolli'st of the three times three
Rent th' apron from her smock, and gave it me;
'Twas soft and gentle, subt'ly spun, no doubt;
Pardon my boldnese, madam; HERE'S THE CLOUT.

I did believe I was in heav'n,
When first the heav'n her self was giv'n,
That in my heart her beams did passe
As some the sun keep in a glasse,
So that her beauties thorow me
Did hurt my rival-enemy.
But fate, alas! decreed it so,
That I was engine to my woe:
For, as a corner'd christal spot,
My heart diaphanous was not;
But solid stuffe, where her eye flings
Quick fire upon the catching strings:
Yet, as at triumphs in the night,
You see the Prince's Arms in light,
So, when I once was set on flame,
I burnt all ore the letters of her name.

You are deceiv'd; I sooner may, dull fair,
Seat a dark Moor in Cassiopea's chair,

        To executed death,
            Ere the bright hiew

It is just Heaven on beauty stamps a fame,

What chains but are too light for me, should I
Say that Lucasta in strange arms could lie?

        Embrac'd each en'mies air;
            That all their good
            Ran in their blood?
'Tis the same wrong th' unworthy to inthrone,
As from her proper sphere t' have vertue thrown.

That strange force on the ignoble hath renown;
As AURUM FULMINANS, it blows vice down.
    'Twere better (heavy one) to crawl

        Are not writ on your brow;
            Odes to faults give
            A shame must live.
When a fat mist we view, we coughing run;
But, that once meteor drawn, all cry: undone.

How bright the fair Paulina did appear,
When hid in jewels she did seem a star!
    But who could soberly behold
    A wicked owl in cloath of gold,
        Or the ridiculous Ape
        In sacred Vesta's shape?
            So doth agree
            Just praise with thee:
For since thy birth gave thee no beauty, know,
No poets pencil must or can do so.

Love drunk, the other day, knockt at my brest,
    But I, alas! was not within.
My man, my ear, told me he came t' attest,
    That without cause h'd boxed him,
And battered the windows of mine eyes,
And took my heart for one of's nunneries.

RHYME a b a b c c 

I wondred at the outrage safe return'd,
    And stormed at the base affront;
And by a friend of mine, bold faith, that burn'd,
    I called him to a strict accompt.
He said that, by the law, the challeng'd might
Take the advantage both of arms and fight.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Two darts of equal length and points he sent,
    And nobly gave the choyce to me,
Which I not weigh'd, young and indifferent,
    Now full of nought but victorie.
So we both met in one of's mother's groves,
The time, at the first murm'ring of her doves.

RHYME a b a b c c 

I stript myself naked all o're, as he:
    For so I was best arm'd, when bare.
His first pass did my liver rase: yet I

For when my arm to its true distance came,
I nothing touch'd but a fantastick flame.

RHYME a b a b c c 

This, this is love we daily quarrel so,
    An idle Don-Quichoterie:

Is to laugh at the boy, and he will cry.

Ne'r half so netled him, as he is now.

RHYME a a *

See! at's own mother he is offering;
  His finger now fits any ring;

And all his love in the antipodes.

Jealous of his chast Psyche, raging he

The dear sweet secrets of the gods he tells,
  And with loath'd hate lov'd heaven he swells;

There's not a vertuous she in all the world.

Poor Fly, caught in an airy net,
Thy wings have fetter'd now thy feet;
Where, like a Lyon in a toyl,
Howere thou keep'st a noble coyl,

A wing, or a self-trapping thigh:
Yet hadst thou fal'n like him, whose coil
Made fishes in the sea to broyl,
When now th'ast scap'd the noble flame;
Trapp'd basely in a slimy frame,
And free of air, thou art become
Slave to the spawn of mud and lome?

RHYME a a *

  Nor is't enough thy self do's dresse
To thy swoln lord a num'rous messe,
And by degrees thy thin veins bleed,

But now devour'd, art like to be
A net spun for thy familie,

RHYME a a *

And, straight expanded in the air,
Hang'st for thy issue too a snare.
Strange witty death and cruel ill
That, killing thee, thou thine dost kill!
Like pies, in whose entombed ark
All fowl crowd downward to a lark,
Thou art thine en'mies' sepulcher,
And in thee buriest, too, thine heir.

  Yet Fates a glory have reserv'd
For one so highly hath deserv'd.

Fall yet triumphant in thy woe,
Bound with the entrails of thy foe.

Oh! she's as kind as drops of new faln April showers,
That on each gentle breast spring fresh perfuming flowers;
She's constant, gen'rous, fixt; she's calm, she is the all
We can of vertue, honour, faith, or glory call,
And she is (whom I thus transmit to endless fame)
Mistresse oth' world and me, and LAURA is her name.

  Upon a day, when the Dog-star
Unto the world proclaim'd a war,
And poyson bark'd from black throat,
And from his jaws infection shot,

RHYME a a *

Under a deadly hen-bane shade
With slime infernal mists are made,
Met the two dreaded enemies,
Having their weapons in their eyes.

RHYME a a *

  First from his den rolls forth that load
Of spite and hate, the speckl'd toad,
And from his chaps a foam doth spawn,
Such as the loathed three heads yawn;
Defies his foe with a fell spit,
To wade through death to meet with it;
Then in his self the lymbeck turns,
And his elixir'd poyson urns.
Arachne, once the fear oth' maid
Coelestial, thus unto her pray'd:
Heaven's blew-ey'd daughter, thine own mother!
The Python-killing Sun's thy brother.

RHYME a a *

Oh! thou, from gods that didst descend,
With a poor virgin to contend,
Shall seed of earth and hell ere be
A rival in thy victorie?
Pallas assents: for now long time
And pity had clean rins'd her crime;
When straight she doth with active fire
Her many legged foe inspire.
Have you not seen a charact lie
A great cathedral in the sea,
Under whose Babylonian walls
A small thin frigot almshouse stalls?
So in his slime the toad doth float
And th' spyder by, but seems his boat.
And now the naumachie begins;
Close to the surface her self spins:
Arachne, when her foe lets flye
A broad-side of his breath too high,

RHYME a a *

That's over-shot, the wisely-stout,
Advised maid doth tack about;
And now her pitchy barque doth sweat,
Chaf'd in her own black fury wet;
Lasie and cold before, she brings
New fires to her contracted stings,
And with discolour'd spumes doth blast
The herbs that to their center hast.
Now to the neighb'ring henbane top
Arachne hath her self wound up,
And thence, from its dilated leaves,
By her own cordage downwards weaves,

RHYME a a *

And doth her town of foe attack,
And storms the rampiers of his back;
Which taken in her colours spread,
March to th' citadel of's head.
Now as in witty torturing Spain,
The brain is vext to vex the brain,
Where hereticks bare heads are arm'd
In a close helm, and in it charm'd
An overgrown and meagre rat,
That peece-meal nibbles himself fat;
So on the toads blew-checquer'd scull
The spider gluttons her self full.
And vomiting her Stygian seeds,
Her poyson on his poyson feeds.
Thus the invenom'd toad, now grown
Big with more poyson than his own,
Doth gather all his pow'rs, and shakes
His stormer in's disgorged lakes;

RHYME a a *

And wounded now, apace crawls on
To his next plantane surgeon,
With whose rich balm no sooner drest,
But purged is his sick swoln breast;
And as a glorious combatant,
That only rests awhile to pant,
Then with repeated strength and scars,
That smarting fire him new to wars,
Deals blows that thick themselves prevent,
As they would gain the time he spent.

RHYME a a *

  So the disdaining angry toad,
That calls but a thin useless load,
His fatal feared self comes back
With unknown venome fill'd to crack.
Th' amased spider, now untwin'd,
Hath crept up, and her self new lin'd
With fresh salt foams and mists, that blast
The ambient air as they past.
And now me thinks a Sphynx's wing
I pluck, and do not write, but sting;
With their black blood my pale inks blent,
Gall's but a faint ingredient.

RHYME a a *

The pol'tick toad doth now withdraw,
Warn'd, higher in CAMPANIA.
There wisely doth, intrenched deep,
His body in a body keep,
And leaves a wide and open pass
T' invite the foe up to his jaws,
Which there within a foggy blind
With fourscore fire-arms were lin'd.
The gen'rous active spider doubts
More ambuscadoes than redoubts;
So within shot she doth pickear,
Now gall's the flank, and now the rear;
As that the toad in's own dispite
Must change the manner of his fight,
Who, like a glorious general,
With one home-charge lets fly at all.
Chaf'd with a fourfold ven'mous foam
Of scorn, revenge, his foes and 's own,
He seats him in his loathed chair,
New-made him by each mornings air,

RHYME a a *

With glowing eyes he doth survey
Th' undaunted hoast he calls his prey;
Then his dark spume he gred'ly laps,
And shows the foe his grave, his chaps.

RHYME a a *

  Whilst the quick wary Amazon
Of 'vantage takes occasion,
And with her troop of leggs carreers
In a full speed with all her speers.
Down (as some mountain on a mouse)
On her small cot he flings his house;
Without the poyson of the elf,
The toad had like t' have burst himself:
For sage Arachne with good heed
Had stopt herself upon full speed,
And, 's body now disorder'd, on
She falls to execution.
The passive toad now only can
Contemn and suffer.  Here began
The wronged maids ingenious rage,
Which his heart venome must asswage.
One eye she hath spet out, strange smother,
When one flame doth put out another,

RHYME a a *

And one eye wittily spar'd, that he
Might but behold his miserie.
She on each spot a wound doth print,
And each speck hath a sting within't;
Till he but one new blister is,
And swells his own periphrasis.
Then fainting, sick, and yellow-pale,
She baths him with her sulph'rous stale;
Thus slacked is her Stygian fire,
And she vouchsafes now to retire.
Anon the toad begins to pant,
Bethinks him of th' almighty plant,
And lest he peece-meal should be sped,
Wisely doth finish himself dead.
Whilst the gay girl, as was her fate,
Doth wanton and luxuriate,
And crowns her conqu'ring head all or
With fatal leaves of hellebore.

RHYME a a *

Not guessing at the pretious aid
Was lent her by the heavenly maid.
The neer expiring toad now rowls
Himself in lazy bloody scrowls,
To th' sov'raign salve of all his ills,
That only life and health distills.
But loe! a terror above all,
That ever yet did him befall!

RHYME a a *

  Pallas, still mindful of her foe,
(Whilst they did with each fires glow)
Had to the place the spiders lar
Dispath'd before the ev'nings star.
He learned was in Natures laws,
Of all her foliage knew the cause,
And 'mongst the rest in his choice want
Unplanted had this plantane plant.

RHYME a a *

  The all-confounded toad doth see
His life fled with his remedie,
And in a glorious despair
First burst himself, and next the air;
Then with a dismal horred yell
Beats down his loathsome breath to hell.

RHYME a a *

  But what inestimable bliss
This to the sated virgin is,
Who, as before of her fiend foe,
Now full is of her goddess too!
She from her fertile womb hath spun
Her stateliest pavillion,
Whilst all her silken flags display,
And her triumphant banners play;

RHYME a a *

Where Pallas she ith' midst doth praise,
And counterfeits her brothers rayes,
Nor will she her dear lar forget,
Victorious by his benefit,
Whose roof inchanted she doth free
From haunting gnat and goblin bee,
Who, trapp'd in her prepared toyle,
To their destruction keep a coyle.

RHYME a a *

  Then she unlocks the toad's dire head,
Within whose cell is treasured
That pretious stone, which she doth call
A noble recompence for all,
And to her lar doth it present,
Of his fair aid a monument.

RHYME a a *

Whilst these my feet go slowly fast.

Large Euclid's strict epitome;
And in each diagram dost fling

And then a serpentine, dost crawl,
Now a straight line, now crook'd, now all.

And thou, from thine own liquid bed,
New Phoebus, heav'st thy pleasant head.

  Who shall a name for thee create,
Deep riddle of mysterious state?
Bold Nature, that gives common birth
To all products of seas and earth,
Of thee, as earth-quakes, is afraid,
Nor will thy dire deliv'ry aid.

RHYME a a *

  Thou, thine own daughter, then, and sire,
That son and mother art intire,
That big still with thy self dost go,
And liv'st an aged embrio;
That like the cubbs of India,
Thou from thy self a while dost play;
But frighted with a dog or gun,
In thine own belly thou dost run,
And as thy house was thine own womb,
So thine own womb concludes thy tomb.

RHYME a a *

  But now I must (analys'd king)
Thy oeconomick virtues sing;
Thou great stay'd husband still within,
Thou thee that's thine dost discipline;
And when thou art to progress bent,
Thou mov'st thy self and tenement,
As warlike Scythians travayl'd, you
Remove your men and city too;

RHYME a a *

Then, after a sad dearth and rain,
Thou scatterest thy silver train;
And when the trees grow nak'd and old,
Thou cloathest them with cloth of gold,
Which from thy bowels thou dost spin,
And draw from the rich mines within.

RHYME a a *

  Now hast thou chang'd thee, saint, and made
Thy self a fane that's cupula'd;
And in thy wreathed cloister thou
Walkest thine own gray fryer too;
Strickt and lock'd up, th'art hood all ore,
And ne'r eliminat'st thy dore.
On sallads thou dost feed severe,
And 'stead of beads thou drop'st a tear,
And when to rest each calls the bell,
Thou sleep'st within thy marble cell,
Where, in dark contemplation plac'd,
The sweets of Nature thou dost tast,

And in a jelly thee dissolve,
Like a shot star, which doth repair

That moveth him by traverse law,
And doth himself both drive and draw;
Then, when the Sunn the south doth winne,

Or that like dames i'th land of Luyck,
He wears his everlasting huyck.
But banisht, I admire his fate,
Since neither ostracisme of state,
Nor a perpetual exile,
Can force this virtue, change his soyl:
For, wheresoever he doth go,
He wanders with his country too.

Whilst I now know my self both free and crown'd.

RHYME a a *

  But as at Meccha's tombe, the devout blind
Pilgrim (great husband of his sight and mind)

It is enough, and sin for to see more.

To whet my dull beams, keep my bold in aw?
Or, are you gentle and compassionate,

Brave prince! who, eagle-ey'd of eagle kind,
Wert blindly damn'd to look thine own self blind!

RHYME a a *

  But oh, return those fires, too cruel-nice!
For whilst you fear me cindars, see, I'm ice!
A nummed speaking clod and mine own show,
My self congeal'd, a man cut out in snow:

RHYME a a *

Return those living fires.  Thou, who that vast
Double advantage from one-ey'd Heav'n hast,
Look with one sun, though 't but obliquely be,
And if not shine, vouchsafe to wink on me.

RHYME a a *

  Perceive you not a gentle, gliding heat,
And quick'ning warmth, that makes the statua sweat;
As rev'rend Ducaleon's black-flung stone,
Whose rough outside softens to skin, anon
Each crusty vein with wet red is suppli'd,
Whilst nought of stone but in its heart doth 'bide.

RHYME a a *

  So from the rugged north, where your soft stay
Hath stampt them a meridian and kind day;
Where now each A LA MODE inhabitant
Himself and 's manners both do pay you rent,
And 'bout your house (your pallace) doth resort,
And 'spite of fate and war creates a court.

RHYME a a *

  So from the taught north, when you shall return,
To glad those looks that ever since did mourn,
When men uncloathed of themselves you'l see,
Then start new made, fit, what they ought to be;
Hast! hast! you, that your eyes on rare sights feed:
For thus the golden triumph is decreed.

RHYME a a *

  The twice-born god, still gay and ever young,
With ivie crown'd, first leads the glorious throng:
He Ariadne's starry coronet
Designs for th' brighter beams of Amoret;
Then doth he broach his throne, and singing quaff
Unto her health his pipe of god-head off.

RHYME a a *

  Him follow the recanting, vexing Nine
Who, wise, now sing thy lasting fame in wine;
Whilst Phoebus, not from th' east, your feast t' adorn,
But from th' inspir'd Canaries, rose this morn.

RHYME a a *

  Now you are come, winds in their caverns sit,
And nothing breaths, but new-inlarged wit.
Hark!  One proclaims it piacle to be sad,
And th' people call 't religion to be mad.

RHYME a a *

  But now, as at a coronation,
When noyse, the guard, and trumpets are oreblown,
The silent commons mark their princes way,
And with still reverence both look and pray;
So they amaz'd expecting do adore,
And count the rest but pageantry before.

RHYME a a *

  Behold! an hoast of virgins, pure as th' air
In her first face, ere mists durst vayl her hair:
Their snowy vests, white as their whiter skin,
Or their far chaster whiter thoughts within:
Roses they breath'd and strew'd, as if the fine
Heaven did to earth his wreath of swets resign;
They sang aloud: "THRICE, OH THRICE HAPPY, THEY
THAT CAN, LIKE THESE, IN LOVE BOTH YIELD AND SWAY."

RHYME a a *

  Next herald Fame (a purple clowd her bears),
In an imbroider'd coat of eyes and ears,
Proclaims the triumph, and these lovers glory,
Then in a book of steel records the story.

RHYME a a *

  And now a youth of more than god-like form
Did th' inward minds of the dumb throng alarm;
All nak'd, each part betray'd unto the eye,
Chastly: for neither sex ow'd he or she.
And this was heav'nly love.  By his bright hand,
A boy of worse than earthly stuff did stand;
His bow broke, his fires out, and his wings clipt,
And the black slave from all his false flames stript;

RHYME a a *

Whose eyes were new-restor'd but to confesse
This day's bright blisse, and his own wretchednesse;
Who, swell'd with envy, bursting with disdain,
Did cry to cry, and weep them out again.

RHYME a a *

  And now what heav'n must I invade, what sphere
Rifle of all her stars, t' inthrone her there?
No!  Phoebus, by thy boys fate we beware
Th' unruly flames o'th' firebrand, thy carr;
Although, she there once plac'd, thou, Sun, shouldst see
Thy day both nobler governed and thee.
Drive on, Bootes, thy cold heavy wayn,
Then grease thy wheels with amber in the main,
And Neptune, thou to thy false Thetis gallop,
Appollo's set within thy bed of scallop:

RHYME a a *

Whilst Amoret, on the reconciled winds
Mounted, and drawn by six caelestial minds,
She armed was with innocence and fire,
That did not burn; for it was chast desire;
Whilst a new light doth gild the standers by.
Behold! it was a day shot from her eye;
Chafing perfumes oth' East did throng and sweat,
But by her breath they melting back were beat.

RHYME a a *

A crown of yet-nere-lighted stars she wore,
In her soft hand a bleeding heart she bore,

RHYME a a *

Then a wing'd crier thrice aloud did call:
LET FAME PROCLAIM THIS ONE GREAT PRISE FOR ALL.

RHYME a a *

  By her a lady that might be call'd fair,
And justly, but that Amoret was there,
Was pris'ner led; th' unvalewed robe she wore
Made infinite lay lovers to adore,
Who vainly tempt her rescue (madly bold)
Chained in sixteen thousand links of gold;
Chrysetta thus (loaden with treasures) slave
Did strow the pass with pearls, and her way pave.

RHYME a a *

  But loe! the glorious cause of all this high
True heav'nly state, brave Philamore, draws nigh,
Who, not himself, more seems himself to be,
And with a sacred extasie doth see!
Fix'd and unmov'd on 's pillars he doth stay,
And joy transforms him his own statua;
Nor hath he pow'r to breath [n]or strength to greet
The gentle offers of his Amoret,
Who now amaz'd at 's noble breast doth knock,
And with a kiss his gen'rous heart unlock;
Whilst she and the whole pomp doth enter there,
Whence her nor Time nor Fate shall ever tear.
But whether am I hurl'd? ho! back! awake
From thy glad trance: to thine old sorrow take!

RHYME a a *

Thus, after view of all the Indies store,
The slave returns unto his chain and oar;
Thus poets, who all night in blest heav'ns dwell,
Are call'd next morn to their true living hell;
So I unthrifty, to myself untrue,
Rise cloath'd with real wants, 'cause wanting you,
And what substantial riches I possesse,
I must to these unvalued dreams confesse.

RHYME a a *

  But all our clowds shall be oreblown, when thee
In our horizon bright once more we see;
When thy dear presence shall our souls new-dress,
And spring an universal cheerfulnesse;
When we shall be orewhelm'd in joy, like they
That change their night for a vast half-year's day.

RHYME a a *

  Then shall the wretched few, that do repine,
See and recant their blasphemies in wine;
Then shall they grieve, that thought I've sung too free,
High and aloud of thy true worth and thee,
And their fowl heresies and lips submit
To th' all-forgiving breath of Amoret;

RHYME a a *

And me alone their angers object call,
That from my height so miserably did fall;
And crie out my invention thin and poor,
Who have said nought, since I could say no more.

  Yet settle here your rest, and take your state,
And in calm halcyon's nest ev'n build your fate;
Prethee lye down securely, Frank, and keep
With as much no noyse the inconstant deep
As its inhabitants; nay, stedfast stand,
As if discover'd were a New-found-land,
Fit for plantation here.  Dream, dream still,
Lull'd in Dione's cradle; dream, untill

Your self a bubbled pastime for the wind;
And in loose Thetis blankets torn and tost.

Chang'd, you would think, with 's botoms properties;
But this eternal, strange Ixion's wheel
Of giddy earth ne'er whirling leaves to reel,
Till all things are inverted, till they are
Turn'd to that antick confus'd state they were.

  Who loves the golden mean, doth safely want
A cobwebb'd cot and wrongs entail'd upon't;
He richly needs a pallace for to breed
Vipers and moths, that on their feeder feed;
The toy that we (too true) a mistress call,
Whose looking-glass and feather weighs up all;
And cloaths which larks would play with in the sun,
That mock him in the night, when 's course is run.

Nay, with a thought come neer it.  Wouldst thou know,
How such a structure should be raisd, build low.

More often shakes the stubborn'st, prop'rest oak;
And in proud turrets we behold withal,
'Tis the imperial top declines to fall:
Nor does Heav'n's lightning strike the humble vales,
But high-aspiring mounts batters and scales.

  A breast of proof defies all shocks of Fate,
Fears in the best, hopes in worser state;
Heaven forbid that, as of old, time ever
Flourish'd in spring so contrary, now never.

Can eas'ly puffe it to a fairer weather.
Why dost despair then, Frank?  Aeolus has
A Zephyrus as well as Boreas.

  'Tis a false sequel, soloecisme 'gainst those
Precepts by fortune giv'n us, to suppose
That, 'cause it is now ill, 't will ere be so;

With his soft harp awakes the sleeping Nine.

  In strictest things magnanimous appear,
Greater in hope, howere thy fate, then fear:

Behold! three sister-wonders, in whom met,
Distinct and chast, the splendrous counterfeit
Of Juno, Venus and the warlike Maid,
Each in their three divinities array'd;
The majesty and state of Heav'ns great Queen,
And when she treats the gods, her noble meen;
The sweet victorious beauties and desires
O' th' sea-born princess, empresse too of fires;
The sacred arts and glorious lawrels torn
From the fair brow o' th' goddesse father-born;
All these were quarter'd in each snowy coat,
With canton'd honours of their own, to boot.
Paris, by fate new-wak'd from his dead cell,
Is charg'd to give his doom impossible.
He views in each the brav'ry of all Ide;
Whilst one, as once three, doth his soul divide.
Then sighs so equally they're glorious all:
WHAT PITY THE WHOLE WORLD IS BUT ONE BALL!

  If Pliny, Lord High Treasurer of all
Natures exchequer shuffled in this our ball,
Peinture her richer rival did admire,
And cry'd she wrought with more almighty fire,
That judg'd the unnumber'd issue of her scrowl,
Infinite and various as her mother soul,
That contemplation into matter brought,
Body'd Ideas, and could form a thought.
Why do I pause to couch the cataract,
And the grosse pearls from our dull eyes abstract,
That, pow'rful Lilly, now awaken'd we
This new creation may behold by thee?

RHYME a a *

  To thy victorious pencil all, that eyes
And minds call reach, do bow.  The deities
Bold Poets first but feign'd, you do and make,
And from your awe they our devotion take.
Your beauteous pallet first defin'd Love's Queen,
And made her in her heav'nly colours seen;
You strung the bow of the Bandite her son,
And tipp'd his arrowes with religion.
Neptune as unknown as his fish might dwell,
But that you seat him in his throne of shell.

RHYME a a *

The thunderers artillery and brand,
You fancied Rome in his fantastick hand;
And the pale frights, the pains, and fears of hell
First from your sullen melancholy fell.
Who cleft th' infernal dog's loath'd head in three,
And spun out Hydra's fifty necks? by thee
As prepossess'd w' enjoy th' Elizian plain,
Which but before was flatter'd in our brain.
Who ere yet view'd airs child invisible,
A hollow voice, but in thy subtile skill?
Faint stamm'ring Eccho you so draw, that we
The very repercussion do see.
  Cheat-HOCUS-POCUS-Nature an assay
O' th' spring affords us: praesto, and away!
You all the year do chain her and her fruits,
Roots to their beds, and flowers to their roots.
Have not mine eyes feasted i' th' frozen Zone
Upon a fresh new-grown collation
Of apples, unknown sweets, that seem'd to me
Hanging to tempt as on the fatal tree,
So delicately limn'd I vow'd to try
My appetite impos'd upon my eye?
  You, sir, alone, fame, and all-conqu'ring rime,
File the set teeth of all-devouring time.

When beauty once thy vertuous paint hath on,
Age needs not call her to vermilion;
Her beams nere shed or change like th' hair of day,
She scatters fresh her everlasting ray.
Nay, from her ashes her fair virgin fire
Ascends, that doth new massacres conspire,
Whilst we wipe off the num'rous score of years,
And do behold our grandsire[s] as our peers;
With the first father of our house compare
We do the features of our new-born heir:
For though each coppied a son, they all
Meet in thy first and true original.
  Sacred! luxurious! what princesse not
But comes to you to have her self begot?
As, when first man was kneaded, from his side
Is born to's hand a ready-made-up bride.
He husband to his issue then doth play,
And for more wives remove the obstructed way:
So by your art you spring up in two noons
What could not else be form'd by fifteen suns;
Thy skill doth an'mate the prolifick flood,
And thy red oyl assimilates to blood.
  Where then, when all the world pays its respect,
Lies our transalpine barbarous neglect?
When the chast hands of pow'rful Titian
Had drawn the scourges of our God and man,
And now the top of th' altar did ascend
To crown the heav'nly piece with a bright end;
Whilst he, who in seven languages gave law,
And always, like the Sun, his subjects saw,
Did, in his robes imperial and gold,
The basis of the doubtful ladder hold.
O Charls! a nobler monument than that,
Which thou thine own executor wert at!
When to our huffling Henry there complain'd
A grieved earl, that thought his honor stain'd:

RHYME a a *

Away (frown'd he), for your own safeties, hast!
In one cheap hour ten coronets I'l cast;
But Holbeen's noble and prodigious worth
Onely the pangs of an whole age brings forth.
Henry! a word so princely saving said,
It might new raise the ruines thou hast made.
  O sacred Peincture! that dost fairly draw,
What but in mists deep inward Poets saw;
'Twixt thee and an Intelligence no odds,
That art of privy council to the gods!
By thee unto our eyes they do prefer
A stamp of their abstracted character;
Thou, that in frames eternity dost bind,
And art a written and a body'd mind;
To thee is ope the Juncto o' th' abysse,
And its conspiracy detected is;
Whilest their cabal thou to our sense dost show,
And in thy square paint'st what they threat below.
  Now, my best Lilly, let's walk hand in hand,
And smile at this un-understanding land;
Let them their own dull counterfeits adore,
Their rainbow-cloaths admire, and no more.
Within one shade of thine more substance is,
Than all their varnish'd idol-mistresses:
Whilst great Vasari and Vermander shall
Interpret the deep mystery of all,

RHYME a a *

And I unto our modern Picts shall show,
What due renown to thy fair art they owe
In the delineated lives of those,
By whom this everlasting lawrel grows.
Then, if they will not gently apprehend,
Let one great blot give to their fame an end;
Whilst no poetick flower their herse doth dresse,
But perish they and their effigies.

For a fair turnip.  Dig, dig on, O clowns
But how this comes about, Fates, can you tell,
This more then Maid of Meurs, this miracle?
Let me not live, if I think not St. Mark
Has all the oar, as well as beasts, in's ark!
No wonder 'tis he marries the rich sea,
But to betroth him to nak'd Poesie,
And with a bankrupt muse to merchandise;
His treasures beams, sure, have put out his eyes.
His conquest at Lepanto I'l let pass,
When the sick sea with turbants night-cap'd was;
And now at Candie his full courage shown,
That wan'd to a wan line the half-half moon.
This is a wreath, this is a victorie,
Caesar himself would have look'd pale to see,
And in the height of all his triumphs feel
Himself but chain'd to such a mighty wheel.

  And now me thinks we ape Augustus state,
So ugly we his high worth imitate,
Monkey his godlike glories; so that we
Keep light and form with such deformitie,
As I have seen an arrogant baboon
With a small piece of glasse zany the sun.
  Rome to her bard, who did her battails sing,
Indifferent gave to poet and to king;
With the same lawrells were his temples fraught,
Who best had written, and who best had fought;
The self same fame they equally did feel,
One's style ador'd as much as t' other's steel.
A chain or fasces she could then afford
The sons of Phoebus, we, an axe or cord;
Sometimes a coronet was her renown,
And ours, the dear prerogative of a crown.
In marble statu'd walks great Lucan lay,
And now we walk, our own pale statua.
They the whole year with roses crownd would dine,
And we in all December know no wine;
Disciplin'd, dieted, sure there hath bin

  Of princes, women, wine, to sing I see
Is no apocrypha: for to rise high
Commend this olio of this lord 'tis fit:
Nay, ten to one, but you have part of it;
There is that justice left, since you maintain
His table, he should counter-feed your brain.
Then write how well he in his sack hath droll'd,
Straight there's a bottle to your chamber roll'd,
Or with embroider'd words praise his French suit,
Month hence 'tis yours with his mans, to boot;
Or but applaud his boss'd legs: two to none,
But he most nobly doth give you one.
Or spin an elegie on his false hair:
'Tis well, he cries, but living hair is dear.
Yet say that out of order ther's one curl,
And all the hopes of your reward you furl.
  Write a deep epick poem, and you may
As soon delight them as the opera,
Where they Diogenes thought in his tub,
Never so sowre did look so sweet a club.
  You that do suck for thirst your black quil's blood,
And chaw your labour'd papers for your food,
I will inform you how and what to praise,
Then skin y' in satin as young Lovelace plaies.
Beware, as you would your fierce guests, your lice,
To strip the cloath of gold from cherish'd vice;

Rather stand off with awe and reverend fear,
Hang a poetick pendant in her ear,
Court her as her adorers do their glasse,
Though that as much of a true substance has,
Whilst all the gall from your wild ink you drain,
The beauteous sweets of vertues cheeks to stain;
And in your livery let her be known,
As poor and tatter'd as in her own.
Nor write, nor speak you more of sacred writ,
But what shall force up your arrested wit.
Be chast; religion and her priests your scorn,
Whilst the vain fanes of idiots you adorn.
It is a mortal errour, you must know,
Of any to speak good, if he be so.
Rayl, till your edged breath flea your raw throat,
And burn remarks on all of gen'rous note;
Each verse be an indictment, be not free
Sanctity 't self from thy scurrility.
Libel your father, and your dam buffoon,
The noblest matrons of the isle lampoon,
Whilst Aretine and 's bodies you dispute,
And in your sheets your sister prostitute.
  Yet there belongs a sweetnesse, softnesse too,
Which you must pay, but first, pray, know to who.
There is a creature, (if I may so call
That unto which they do all prostrate fall)
Term'd mistress, when they'r angry; but, pleas'd high,
It is a princesse, saint, divinity.
To this they sacrifice the whole days light,
Then lye with their devotion all night;
For this you are to dive to the abysse,
And rob for pearl the closet of some fish.

Would have procur'd your head thatch from the rain
Not all the arms of Thebes and Troy would get
One knife but to anatomize your meat,
A funeral elegie, with a sad boon,
Might make you (hei!) sip wine like maccaroon;

But if perchance there did a riband come,
Not the train-band so fierce with all its drum:
Yet with your torch you homeward would retire,
And heart'ly wish your bed your fun'ral pyre.
  With what a fury have I known you feed
Upon a contract and the hopes 't might speed!
Not the fair bride, impatient of delay,
Doth wish like you the beauties of that day;
Hotter than all the roasted cooks you sat
To dresse the fricace of your alphabet,
Which sometimes would be drawn dough anagrame,
Sometimes acrostick parched in the flame;
Then posies stew'd with sippets, mottos by:
Of minced verse a miserable pye.
How many knots slip'd, ere you twist their name
With th' old device, as both their heart's the same!
Whilst like to drills the feast in your false jaw
You would transmit at leisure to your maw;
Then after all your fooling, fat, and wine,
Glutton'd at last, return at home to pine.
  Tell me, O Sun, since first your beams did play
To night, and did awake the sleeping day;
Since first your steeds of light their race did start,
Did you ere blush as now?  Oh thou, that art
The common father to the base pissmire,
As well as great Alcides, did the fire
From thine owne altar which the gods adore,
Kindle the souls of gnats and wasps before?
  Who would delight in his chast eyes to see
Dormise to strike at lights of poesie?
Faction and envy now are downright rage.
Once a five-knotted whip there was, the stage:

The beadle and the executioner,
To whip small errors, and the great ones tear;
Now, as er'e Nimrod the first king, he writes:
That's strongest, th' ablest deepest bites.
The muses weeping fly their hill, to see
Their noblest sons of peace in mutinie.
Could there nought else this civil war compleat,
But poets raging with poetic heat,
Tearing themselves and th' endlesse wreath, as though
Immortal they, their wrath should be so, too?
And doubly fir'd Apollo burns to see
In silent Helicon a naumachie.
Parnassus hears these at his first alarms;
Never till now Minerva was in arms.
  O more then conqu'ror of the world, great Rome!
Thy heros did with gentleness or'e come
Thy foes themselves, but one another first,
Whilst envy stript alone was left, and burst.
The learn'd Decemviri, 'tis true, did strive,
But to add flames to keep their fame alive;
Whilst the eternal lawrel hung ith' air:
Nor of these ten sons was there found one heir.
Like to the golden tripod, it did pass
From this to this, till 't came to him, whose 'twas.
Caesar to Gallus trundled it, and he
To Maro: Maro, Naso, unto thee?
Naso to his Tibullus flung the wreath,
He to Catullus thus did bequeath.
This glorious circle, to another round,
At last the temples of their god it bound.
  I might believe at least, that each might have
A quiet fame contented in his grave,

RHYME a a *

Envy the living, not the dead, doth bite:
For after death all men receave their right.
If it be sacriledge for to profane
Their holy ashes, what is't then their flame?
He does that wrong unweeting or in ire,
As if one should put out the vestal fire.
  Let earths four quarters speak, and thou, Sun, bear
Now witnesse for thy fellow-traveller.
I was ally'd, dear Uncle, unto thee
In blood, but thou, alas, not unto me;
Your vertues, pow'rs, and mine differ'd at best,
As they whose springs you saw, the east and west.
Let me awhile be twisted in thy shine,
And pay my due devotions at thy shrine.
  Might learned Waynman rise, who went with thee
In thy heav'ns work beside divinity,
I should sit still; or mighty Falkland stand
To justifie with breath his pow'rful hand;
The glory, that doth circle your pale urn,
Might hallow'd still and undefiled burn:
But I forbear. Flames, that are wildly thrown
At sacred heads, curle back upon their own;
Sleep, heavenly Sands, whilst what they do or write,
Is to give God himself and you your right.
  There is not in my mind one sullen fate
Of old, but is concentred in our state:
Vandall ore-runners, Goths in literature:
Ploughmen that would Parnassus new-manure;
Ringers of verse that all-in-chime,
And toll the changes upon every rime.
A mercer now by th' yard does measure ore
An ode, which was but by the foot before;
Deals you an ell of epigram, and swears
It is the strongest and the finest wears.

No wonder, if a drawer verses rack,
If 'tis not his, 't may be the spir't of sack;
Whilst the fair bar-maid stroaks the muses teat,
For milk to make the posset up compleat.
  Arise, thou rev'rend shade, great Johnson, rise!
Break through thy marble natural disguise!
Behold a mist of insects, whose meer breath
Will melt thy hallow'd leaden house of death.
What was Crispinus, that you should defie
The age for him?  He durst not look so high
As your immortal rod, he still did stand
Honour'd, and held his forehead to thy brand.
These scorpions, with which we have to do,
Are fiends, not only small but deadly too.
Well mightst thou rive thy quill up to the back,
And scrue thy lyre's grave chords, untill they crack.
For though once hell resented musick, these
Divels will not, but are in worse disease.
How would thy masc'line spirit, father Ben,
Sweat to behold basely deposed men,
Justled from the prerog'tive of their bed,
Whilst wives are per'wig'd with their husbands head?
Each snatches the male quill from his faint hand,
And must both nobler write and understand,
He to her fury the soft plume doth bow:
O pen, nere truely justly slit till now!
Now as her self a poem she doth dresse.
And curls a line, as she would do a tresse;
Powders a sonnet as she does her hair,
Then prostitutes them both to publick aire.
Nor is 't enough, that they their faces blind
With a false dye; but they must paint their mind,

RHYME a a *

In meeter scold, and in scann'd order brawl,
Yet there's one Sapho left may save them all.
  But now let me recal my passion.
Oh! (from a noble father, nobler son)
You, that alone are the Clarissimi,
And the whole gen'rous state of Venice be,
It shall not be recorded Sanazar
Shall boast inthron'd alone this new made star;
You, whose correcting sweetnesse hath forbad
Shame to the good, and glory to the bad;
Whose honour hath ev'n into vertue tam'd
These swarms, that now so angerly I nam'd.
Forgive what thus distemper'd I indite:
For it is hard a SATYRE not to write.
Yet, as a virgin that heats all her blood
At the first motion of bad understood,
Then, at meer thought of fair chastity,
Straight cools again the tempests of her sea:
  So when to you I my devotions raise,
  All wrath and storms do end in calm and praise.

Struggles the soul of my divided quill,
Whilst this foot doth the watry mount aspire,
That Sinai's living and enlivening fire,

O' th' Sun and his, first kindled his sight,
And my lost thoughts invoke the prince of day,
My right to th' spring of it and him do pray.

  Say, happy youth, crown'd with a heav'nly ray
Of the first flame, and interwreathed bay,
Inform my soul in labour to begin,
Ios or Anthems, Poeans or a Hymne.

  Heark! how the moving chords temper our brain,
As when Apollo serenades the main,
Old Ocean smooths his sullen furrow'd front,
And Nereids do glide soft measures on't;
Whilst th' air puts on its sleekest, smoothest face,
And each doth turn the others looking-glasse;
So by the sinewy lyre now strook we see
Into soft calms all storm of poesie,
And former thundering and lightning lines,
And verse now in its native lustre shines.

  How wert thou hid within thyself! how shut!
Thy pretious Iliads lock'd up in a nut!
Not hearing of thee thou dost break out strong,
Invading forty thousand men in song;

Whilst the most valiant of our wits now sue,
Fling down their arms, ask quarter too of you.

By what name shall I stamp my miracle?
Thou strange inverted Aeson, that leap'st ore
From thy first infancy into fourscore,

That to thine own self hast the midwife play'd,
And from thy brain spring'st forth the heav'nly maid!
Thou staffe of him bore him, that bore our sins,
Which, but set down, to bloom and bear begins!
Thou rod of Aaron, with one motion hurl'd,
Bud'st a perfume of flowers through the world!
You strange calcined seeds within a glass,
Each species Idaea spring'st as 'twas!
Bright vestal flame that, kindled but ev'n now,
For ever dost thy sacred fires throw!

  But all these flour'shing hiews, with which I die
Thy virgin paper, now are vain as I:
For 'bove the poets Heav'n th' art taught to shine
And move, as in thy proper crystalline;
Whence that mole-hill Parnassus thou dost view,
And us small ants there dabbling in its dew;
Whence thy seraphic soul such hymns doth play,
As those to which first danced the first day,

Where with a thorn from the world-ransoming wreath
Thou stung, dost antiphons and anthems breathe;
Where with an Angels quil dip'd i' th' Lambs blood,
Thou sing'st our Pelicans all-saving flood,
And bath'st thy thoughts in ever-living streams,
Rench'd from earth's tainted, fat and heavy steams.
There move translated youth inroll'd i' th' quire,
That only doth with wholy lays inspire;
To whom his burning coach Eliah sent,
And th' royal prophet-priest his harp hath lent;
Which thou dost tune in consort unto those
Clap wings for ever at each hallow'd close:
Whilst we, now weak and fainting in our praise,
Sick echo ore thy Halleluiahs.

Oh, who would live, and not ore-whelm'd in it?

Once more the mighty Fletcher doth arise,
Roab'd in a vest studded with stars and eyes

See! in this glad farewel he doth appear
Stuck with the Constellations of his Sphere,

Fearing we numb'd fear'd no flagration,

As some rich beauty doth his wretched heart;
Wild at his real poverty, and so wise
To win her, turns himself into a prise.
First startles her with th' emerald Mad-Lover
The ruby Arcas, least she should recover
Her dazled thought, a Diamond he throws,
Splendid in all the bright Aspatia's woes;
Then to sum up the abstract of his store,
He flings a rope of Pearl of forty more.
Ah, see! the stagg'ring virtue faints! which he
Beholding, darts his Wealths Epitome;
And now, to consummate her wished fall,
Shows this one Carbuncle, that darkens all.

For singing, troth, is but in tune to speak.

RHYME a b a b c c 

Nor trus thy golden feet and wings.
  It may be thought false melody
T' ascend to heav'n by silver strings;

Sir, how unravell'd is the golden fleece:
Men, that could only fool at FOX AND GEESE,
Are new-made polititians by thy book,
And both can judge and conquer with a look.
The hidden fate of princes you unfold;
Court, clergy, commons, by your law control'd.
Strange, serious wantoning all that they
Bluster'd and clutter'd for, you PLAY.

RHYME a a *

  Tis not from cheap thanks thinly to repay
Th' immortal grove of thy fair-order'd bay
Thou planted'st round my humble fane, that I
Stick on thy hearse this sprig of Elegie:
Nor that your soul so fast was link'd in me,
That now I've both, since't has forsaken thee:
That thus I stand a Swisse before thy gate,
And dare, for such another, time and fate.
Alas! our faiths made different essays,
Our Minds and Merits brake two several ways;
Justice commands I wake thy learned dust,
And truth, in whom all causes center must.

RHYME a a *

  Behold! when but a youth, thou fierce didst whip
Upright the crooked age, and gilt vice strip;
A senator praetext, that knew'st to sway
The fasces, yet under the ferula;
Rank'd with the sage, ere blossome did thy chin,
Sleeked without, and hair all ore within,
Who in the school could'st argue as in schools:
Thy lessons were ev'n academie rules.
So that fair Cam saw thee matriculate,
At once a tyro and a graduate.

RHYME a a *

  At nineteen, what ESSAYES have we beheld!
That well might have the book of Dogmas swell'd;
Tough Paradoxes, such as Tully's, thou
Didst heat thee with, when snowy was thy brow,
When thy undown'd face mov'd the Nine to shake,
And of the Muses did a decad make.
What shall I say? by what allusion bold?
NONE BUT THE SUN WAS ERE SO YOUNG AND OLD.

  Young reverend shade, ascend awhile! whilst we
Now celebrate this posthume victorie,
This victory, that doth contract in death
Ev'n all the pow'rs and labours of thy breath.
Like the Judean Hero, in thy fall
Thou pull'st the house of learning on us all.
And as that soldier conquest doubted not,
Who but one splinter had of Castriot,

RHYME a a *

But would assault ev'n death so strongly charmd,
And naked oppose rocks, with his bone arm'd;
So we, secure in this fair relique, stand
The slings and darts shot by each profane hand.
These soveraign leaves thou left'st us are become
Sear clothes against all Times infection.

  Sacred Hierocles, whose heav'nly thought
First acted ore this comment, ere it wrote,
Thou hast so spirited, elixir'd, we
Conceive there is a noble alchymie,
That's turning of this gold to something more
Pretious than gold, we never knew before.
Who now shall doubt the metempsychosis
Of the great Author, that shall peruse this?
Let others dream thy shadow wandering strays
In th' Elizian mazes hid with bays;
Or that, snatcht up in th' upper region,
'Tis kindled there a constellation;
I have inform'd me, and declare with ease
THY SOUL IS FLED INTO HIEROCLES.

  To pay my love to thee, and pay it so,
As honest men should what they justly owe,
Were to write better of thy life, then can
The assured'st pen of the most worthy man.
Such was thy composition, such thy mind,
Improv'd from vertue, and from vice refin'd;
Thy youth an abstract of the world's best parts,
Invr'd to arms and exercis'd to arts,
Which, with the vigour of a man, became
Thine and thy countries piramids of fame.
Two glorious lights to guide our hopeful youth
Into the paths of honour and of truth.
  These parts (so rarely met) made up in thee,
What man should in his full perfection be:

RHYME a a *

So sweet a temper into every sence
And each affection breath'd an influence,
As smooth'd them to a calme, which still withstood
The ruffling passions of untamed blood,
Without a wrinckle in thy face, to show
Thy stable breast could a disturbance know.
In fortune humble, constant in mischance;
Expert in both, and both serv'd to advance
Thy name by various trialls of thy spirit,
And give the testimony of thy merit.
Valiant to envy of the bravest men,
And learned to an undisputed pen;
Good as the best in both and great, but yet
No dangerous courage nor offensive wit.
These ever serv'd the one for to defend,
The other, nobly to advance thy friend,

RHYME a a *

Under which title I have found my name
Fix'd in the living chronicle of fame
To times succeeding: yet I hence must go,
Displeas'd I cannot celebrate thee so.
But what respect, acknowledgement and love,
What these together, when improv'd, improve:
Call it by any name (so it express
Ought like a tribute to thy worthyness,
And may my bounden gratitude become)
LOVELACE, I offer at thy honour'd tomb.
  And though thy vertues many friends have bred
To love thee liveing, and lament thee dead,
In characters far better couch'd then these,
Mine will not blott thy fame, nor theirs encrease.
'Twas by thine own great merits rais'd so high,
That, maugre time and fate, it shall not dye.

RHYME a a *

The rose and other fragrant flowers smell best,
When they are pluck'd and worn in hand or brest,
So this fair flow'r of vertue, this rare bud
Of wit, smells now as fresh as when he stood;
And in these Posthume-Poems lets us know,
He on the banks of Helicon did grow.
The beauty of his soul did correspond
With his sweet out-side: nay, it went beyond.

RHYME a a *

  Lovelace, the minion of the Thespian dames,
  Apollo's darling, born with Enthean flames,
  Which in his numbers wave and shine so clear,
  As sparks refracted from rich gemmes appear;
Such flames that may inspire, and atoms cast,
To make new poets not like him in hast.

RHYME a a *

  Pardon (blest shade), that I thus crowd to be
'Mong those that sin unto thy memory,
And that I think unvalu'd reliques spread,
And am the first that pillages the dead;
Since who would be thy mourner as befits,
But an officious sacriledge commits.
How my tears strive to do thee fairer right,
And from the characters divide my sight.
Untill it (dimmer) a new torrent swells,
And what obscur'd it, falls my spectacles

RHYME a a *

As they would not be wept, but weep the eyes,
But the weak bubbles of mortalitie;

RHYME a a *

Until our griefs are drawn up by the Sun,
And that (too) drop the exhalation.
How in thy dust we humble now our pride,
And bring thee a whole people mortifi'd!
For who expects not death, now thou art gone,
Shows his low folly, not religion.
  Can the poetick heaven still hold on
The golden dance, when the first mover's gon?

RHYME a a *

And the snatch'd fires (which circularly hurl'd)
In their strong rapture glimmer to the world,
And not stupendiously rather rise
The tapers unto these solemnities?
  Can the chords move in tune, when thou dost dye,
At once their universal harmony?
But where Apollo's harp (with murmur) laid,
Had to the stones a melody convey'd,

RHYME a a *

They by some pebble summon'd would reply
In loud results to every battery;
Thus do we come unto thy marble room,
To eccho from the musick of thy tombe.
  May we dare speak thee dead, that wouldest be
In thy remove only not such as we?
No wonder, the advance is from us hid;
Earth could not lift thee higher then it did!
And thou, that didst grow up so ever nigh,
Art but now gone to immortality!
So near to where thou art, thou here didst dwell,
The change to thee is less perceptible.

RHYME a a *

  Thy but unably-comprehending clay,
To what could not be circumscrib'd, gave way,
And the more spacious tennant to return,
Crack'd (in the two restrain'd estate) its urn.
That is but left to a successive trust;
The soul's first buried in his bodies dust.
  Thou more thy self, now thou art less confin'd,
Art not concern'd in what is left behind;
While we sustain the losse that thou art gone,
Un-essenc'd in the separation;
And he that weeps thy funerall, in one
Is pious to the widdow'd nation.
  And under what (now) covert must I sing,
Secure as if beneath a cherub's wing;
When thou hast tane thy flight hence, and art nigh
In place to some related hierarchie,
Where a bright wreath of glories doth but set
Upon thy head an equal coronet;
And thou, above our humble converse gon,
Canst but be reach'd by contemplation.
  Our lutes (as thine was touch'd) were vocall by,
And thence receiv'd the soul by sympathy,
That did above the threds inspiring creep,
And with soft whispers broke the am'rous sleep;
Which now no more (mov'd with the sweet surprise)
Awake into delicious rapsodies;

RHYME a a *

But with their silent mistress do comply,
And fast in undisturbed slumbers lye.
  How from thy first ascent thou didst disperse
A blushing warmth throughout the universe,
While near the morns Lucasta's fires did glow,
And to the earth a purer dawn did throw.
We ever saw thee in the roll of fame
Advancing thy already deathless name;
And though it could but be above its fate,
Thou would'st, however, super-errogate.
  Now as in Venice, when the wanton State
Before a Spaniard spread their crowded plate,
He made it the sage business of his eye
To find the root of the wild treasury;
So learn't from that exchequer but the more
To rate his masters vegetable ore.

RHYME a a *

Thus when the Greek and Latin muse we read,
As but the cold inscriptions of the dead,
We to advantage then admired thee,
Who did'st live on still with thy poesie;
And in our proud enjoyments never knew
The end of the unruly wealth that grew.
But now we have the last dear ingots gain'd,
And the free vein (however rich) is drein'd;
Though what thou hast bequeathed us, no space
Of this worlds span of time shall ere embrace.
But as who sometimes knew not to conclude
Upon the waters strange vicissitude,
Did to the ocean himself commit,
That it might comprehend what could not it,
So we in our endeavours must out-done
Be swallowed up within thy Helicon.
  Thou, who art layd up in thy precious cave,
And from the hollow spaces of thy grave,

RHYME a a *

We still may mourn in tune, but must alone
Hereafter hope to quaver out a grone;
No more the chirping sonnets with shrill notes
Must henceforth volley from our treble throtes;
But each sad accent must be humour'd well
To the deep solemn organ of thy cell.
  Why should some rude hand carve thy sacred stone,
And there incise a cheap inscription?
When we can shed the tribute of our tears
So long, till the relenting marble wears;
Which shall such order in their cadence keep,
That they a native epitaph shall weep;
Untill each letter spelt distinctly lyes,
Cut by the mystick droppings of our eyes.

RHYME a a *

Me thinks, when kings, prophets, and poets dye,
We should not bid men weep, nor ask them why,
But the great loss should by instinct impair
The nations, like a pestilential ayr,
And in a moment men should feel the cramp
Of grief, like persons poyson'd with a damp.
All things in nature should their death deplore,
And the sun look less lovely than before;
The fixed stars should change their constant spaces,
And comets cast abroad their flagrant faces.
Yet still we see princes and poets fall
Without their proper pomp of funerall;
Men look about, as if they nere had known
The poets lawrell or the princes crown;

RHYME a a *

Lovelace hath long been dead, and he can be
Oblig'd to no man for an elegie.
Are you all turn'd to silence, or did he
Retain the only sap of poesie,
That kept all branches living? must his fall
Set an eternal period upon all?
So when a spring-tide doth begin to fly
From the green shoar, each neighbouring creek grows dry.
But why do I so pettishly detract
An age that is so perfect, so exact?
In all things excellent, it is a fame
Or glory to deceased Lovelace name:
For he is weak in wit, who doth deprave
Anothers worth to make his own seem brave;

RHYME a a *

And this was not his aim: nor is it mine.
I now conceive the scope of their designe,
Which is with one consent to bring and burn
Contributary incence on his urn,
Where each mans love and fancy shall be try'd,
As when great Johnson or brave Shakespear dyed.
Wits must unite: for ignorance, we see,
Hath got a great train of artillerie:
Yet neither shall nor can it blast the fame
And honour of deceased Lovelace name,
Whose own LUCASTA can support his credit
Amongst all such who knowingly have read it;
But who that praise can by desert discusse
Due to those poems that are posthumous?

RHYME a a *

And if the last conceptions are the best,
Those by degrees do much transcend the rest;
So full, so fluent, that they richly sute
With Orpheus lire, or with Anacreons lute,
And he shall melt his wing, that shall aspire
To reach a fancy or one accent higher.
Holland and France have known his nobler parts,
And found him excellent in arms and arts.
To sum up all, few men of fame but know,
He was TAM MARTI, QUAM MERCURIO.

RHYME a a *

  Thy pious hand, planting fraternal bayes,
Deserving is of most egregious praise;
Since 'tis the organ doth to us convey
From a descended sun so bright a ray.
Clear spirit! how much we are bound to thee
For this so great a liberalitie,
The truer worth of which by much exceeds
The western wealth, which such contention breeds!
Like the Infusing-God, from the well-head
Of poesie you have besprinkled
Our brows with holy drops, the very last,
Which from your Brother's happy pen were cast:

RHYME a a *

Yet as the last, the best; such matchlesse skill
From his divine alembick did distill.
Your honour'd Brother in the Elyzian shade
Will joy to know himself a laureat made
By your religious care, and that his urn
Doth him on earth immortal life return.
Your self you have a good physician shown
To his much grieved friends and to your own,

RHYME a a *

In giving this elixir'd medecine,
For greatest grief a soveraign anodine.
  Sir, from your Brother y' have convey'd us bliss;
Now, since your genius so concurs with his,
Let your own quill our next enjoyments frame;
All must be rich, that's grac'd with Lovelace name.

RHYME a a *

Great son of Mars, and of Minerva too!
With what oblations must we come to woo
Thy sacred soul to look down from above,
And see how much thy memory we love,
Whose happy pen so pleased amorous ears,
And, lifting bright LUCASTA to the sphears,
Her in the star-bespangled orb did set
Above fair Ariadnes coronet,
Leaving a pattern to succeeding wits,
By which to sing forth their Pythonick fits.

RHYME a a *

Shall we bring tears and sighs? no, no! then we
Should but bemone our selves for loosing thee,
Or else thy happiness seem to deny,
Or to repine at thy felicity.
Then, whilst we chant out thine immortal praise,
Our offerings shall be onely sprigs of bays;
And if our tears will needs their brinks out-fly,
We'l weep them forth into an elegy,
To tell the world, how deep fates wounded wit,
When Atropos the lovely Lovelace hit!
How th' active fire, which cloath'd thy gen'rous mind,
Consum'd the water, and the earth calcin'd

RHYME a a *

Untill a stronger heat by death was given,
Which sublimated thy poor soul to heaven.
Thou knew'st right well to guide the warlike steed,
And yet could'st court the Muses with full speed
And such success, that the inspiring Nine
Have fill'd their Thespian fountain so with brine.
Henceforth we can expect no lyrick lay,
But biting satyres through the world must stray.
Bellona joyns with fair Erato too,
And with the Destinies do keep adoe,
Whom thus she queries: could not you awhile
Reprieve his life, until another file
Of poems such as these had been drawn up?
The fates reply'd that thou wert taken up,
A sacrifice unto the deities;
Since things most perfect please their holy eyes,
And that no other victim could be found
With so much learning and true virtue crown'd.
Since it is so, in peace for ever rest;
Tis very just that God should have the best.

Lovelace is dead! then let the world return
To its first chaos, mufled in its urn;
The stars and elements together lye,
Drench'd in perpetual obscurity,
And the whole machine in confusion be,
As immethodick as an anarchie.
May the great eye of day weep out his light,
Pale Cynthia leave the regiment of night,
The galaxia, all in sables dight,
Send forth no corruscations to our sight,
The Sister-Graces and the sacred Nine,
Statu'd with grief, attend upon his shrine,
Whose worth, whose loss, should we but truly rate,
'Twould puzzle our arithmetic to state
Th' accompt of vertu's so transcendent high,
Number and value reach infinity.

Did I pronounce him dead! no, no! he lives,
And from his aromatique cell he gives
Spice-breathed fumes, whose odoriferous scent
(In zephre-gales which never can be spent)
Doth spread it self abroad, and much out-vies
The eastern bird in her self-sacrifice;
Or Father Phoebus, who to th' world derives
Such various and such multiformed lives,
Took notice that brave Lovelace did inspire
The universe with his Promethean fire,
And snatcht him hence, before his thread was spun,
En'ving that here should be another Sun.   

RHYME a a *

Tread (reader) gently, gently ore
The happy dust beneath this floor:
For in this narrow vault is set
An alablaster cabinet,
Wherein both arts and arms were put,
Like Homers Iliads in a nut,
Till Death with slow and easie pace
Snatcht the bright jewell from the case;
And now, transform'd, he doth arise
A constellation in the skies,
Teaching the blinded world the way,
Through night, to startle into day:
And shipwrackt shades, with steady hand,
He steers unto th' Elizian land.

RHYME a b a b b c c

This is the Month, and this the happy morn
Wherin the Son of Heav'ns eternal King,
Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born,
Our great redemption from above did bring;
For so the holy sages once did sing,
That he our deadly forfeit should release,
And with his Father work us a perpetual peace.

RHYME a b a b b c c

That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable,
And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty,
Wherwith he wont at Heav'ns high Councel-Table,                      
To sit the midst of Trinal Unity,
He laid aside; and here with us to be,
Forsook the Courts of everlasting Day,
And chose with us a darksom House of mortal Clay.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Say Heav'nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein
Afford a present to the Infant God?
Hast thou no vers, no hymn, or solemn strein,
To welcom him to this his new abode,
Now while the Heav'n by the Suns team untrod,
Hath took no print of the approching light,                          
And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright?

RHYME a b a b b c c

See how from far upon the Eastern rode
The Star-led Wisards haste with odours sweet,
O run,  prevent them with thy humble ode,
And lay it lowly at his blessed feet;
Have thou the honour first, thy Lord to greet,
And joyn thy voice unto the Angel Quire,
From out his secret Altar toucht with hallow'd fire.

IT was the Winter wilde,
While the Heav'n-born-childe,                                        
All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;
Nature in aw to him
Had doff't her gawdy trim,
With her great Master so to sympathize:
It was no season then for her
To wanton with the Sun her lusty Paramour.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Only with speeches fair
She woo'd the gentle Air
To hide her guilty front with innocent Snow,
And on her naked shame,                                              
Pollute with sinfull blame,
The Saintly Vail of Maiden white to throw,
Confounded, that her Makers eyes
Should look so near upon her foul deformities.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

But he her fears to cease,
Sent down the meek-eyd Peace,
She crown'd with Olive green, came softly sliding
Down through the turning sphear
His ready Harbinger,
With Turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing,                        
And waving wide her mirtle wand,
She strikes a universall Peace through Sea and Land.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

No War, or Battails sound
Was heard the World around,
The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
The hooked Chariot stood
Unstain'd with hostile blood,
The Trumpet spake not to the armed throng,
And Kings sate still with awfull eye,
As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by.                     

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

But peacefull was the night
Wherin the Prince of light
His raign of peace upon the earth began:
The Windes with wonder whist,
Smoothly the waters kist,
Whispering new joyes to the milde Ocean,
Who now hath quite forgot to rave,
While Birds of Calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

The Stars with deep amaze
Stand fit in steadfast gaze,                                         
Bending one way their pretious influence,
And will not take their flight,
For all the morning light,
Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;
But in their glimmering Orbs did glow,
Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

And though the shady gloom
Had given day her room,
The Sun himself with-held his wonted speed,
And hid his head for shame,                                          
As his inferior flame,
The new enlightened world no more should need;
He saw a greater Sun appear
Then his bright Throne, or burning Axletree could bear.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

The Shepherds on the Lawn,
Or ere the point of dawn,
Sate simply chatting in a rustic row;
Full little thought they than,
That the mighty Pan
Was kindly com to live with them below;                              
Perhaps their loves, or els their sheep,
Was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

When such Musick sweet
Their hearts and ears did greet,
As never was by mortal finger strook,
Divinely-warbled voice
Answering the stringed noise,
As all their souls in blisfull rapture took:
The Air such pleasure loth to lose,
With  thousand echo's still prolongs each heav'nly close.           

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Nature that heard such  sound
Beneath  the hollow round
of Cynthia's seat the Airy region thrilling,
Now was almost won
To think her part was don
And that her raign had here its last fulfilling;
She knew such harmony alone
Could hold all Heav'n and Earth in happier union.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

At last surrounds their sight
A globe of circular light,                                          
That with long beams the shame faced night arrayed
The helmed Cherubim
And sworded Seraphim,
Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid,
Harping in loud and solemn quire,
With unexpressive notes to Heav'ns new-born Heir.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Such Musick (as 'tis said)
Before was never made,
But when of old the sons of morning sung,
While the Creator Great
His constellations set,                                             
And the well-ballanc't world on hinges hung,
And cast the dark foundations deep,
And bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Ring out ye Crystall sphears,
Once bless our human ears,
(If ye have power to touch our senses so)
And let your silver chime
Move in melodious time;
And let the Base of Heav'ns deep Organ blow,                        
And with your ninefold harmony
Make up full consort to th'Angelike symphony.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

For if such holy Song
Enwrap our fancy long,
Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold,
And speckl'd vanity
Will sicken soon and die,
And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould,
And Hell it self will pass away
And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.                 

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Yea Truth, and Justice then
Will down return to men,
Th'enameld Arras of the Rain-bow wearing,
And Mercy set between
Thron'd in Celestiall sheen,
With radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing,
And Heav'n as at som festivall,
Will open wide the gates of her high Palace Hall.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

But wisest Fate sayes  no,
This must not yet be so,                                            
The Babe lies yet in smiling Infancy,
That on the bitter cross
Must redeem our loss;
So both himself and us to glorifie:
Yet first to those ychain'd in sleep,
The Wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep,

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

With such a horrid clang
As on Mount Sinai rang
While the red fire, and smouldring clouds out brake:
The aged Earth agast                                                
With terrour of that blast,
Shall from the surface to the center shake;
When at the worlds last session,
The dreadfull Judge in middle Air shall spread his throne.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

And then at last  our bliss
Full and perfect is,
But now begins; for from this happy day
Th'old Dragon under ground
In straiter limits bound,
Not half so far casts his usurped sway,                             
And wrath to see his Kingdom fail,
Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

The Oracles are dumm,
No voice or hideous humm
Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
Apollo from his shrine
Can no more divine,
With hollow shreik the steep of Delphos leaving.
No nightly trance, or breathed spell,
Inspire's the pale-ey'd Priest from the prophetic cell.             

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

The lonely mountains o're,
And the resounding shore,
A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;
>From haunted spring, and dale
Edg'd with poplar pale
The parting Genius is with sighing sent,
With flowre-inwov'n tresses torn
The Nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

In consecrated Earth,
And on the holy Hearth,                                             
The Lars, and Lemures moan with midnight plaint,
In Urns, and Altars round,
A drear, and dying sound
Affrights the Flamins at their service quaint;
And the chill Marble seems to sweat,
While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

Peor, and Baalim,
Forsake their Temples dim,
With that twise-batter'd god of Palestine,
And mooned Ashtaroth,                                               
Heav'ns Queen and Mother both,
Now sits not girt with Tapers holy shine,
The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn,
In vain the Tyrian Maids their wounded Thamuz mourn.

RHYME a a b c c b d d 

And sullen Moloch fled,
Hath left in shadows dred,
His burning Idol all of blackest hue,
In vain with Cymbals ring,
They call the grisly king,
In dismall dance about the furnace Blue;                            
And Brutish gods of Nile as fast,
lsis and Orus, and the Dog Anubis hast.

ERE-while of Musick, and Ethereal mirth,
Wherwith the stage of Ayr and Earth did ring,
And joyous news of heav'nly Infants birth,
My muse with Angels did divide to sing;
But headlong joy is ever on the wing,
In Wintry solstice like the shortn'd light
Soon swallow'd up in dark and long out-living night.

RHYME a b a b b c c

For now to sorrow must I tune my song,
And set my Harpe to notes of saddest wo,
Which on our dearest Lord did sease er'e long,
Dangers, and snares, and wrongs, and worse then so,                  
Which he for us did freely undergo.
Most perfect Heroe, try'd in heaviest plight
Of labours huge and hard, too hard for human wight.

RHYME a b a b b c c

He sov'ran Priest stooping his regall head
That dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes,
Poor fleshly Tabernacle entered,
His starry front low-rooft beneath the skies;
O what a Mask was there, what a disguise!
Yet more; the stroke of death he must abide,                         
Then lies him meekly down fast by his Brethrens side.

RHYME a b a b b c c

These latter scenes confine my roving vers,
To this Horizon is my Phoebus bound,
His Godlike acts, and his temptations fierce,
And former sufferings other where are found;
Loud o're the rest Cremona's Trump doth sound;
Me softer airs befit, and softer strings
Of Lute, or Viol still, more apt for mournful things.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Befriend me night best Patroness of grief,
Over the Pole thy thickest mantle throw,                             
And work my flatterd fancy to belief,
That Heav'n and Earth are colour'd with my wo;
My sorrows are too dark for day to know:
The leaves should all be black wheron I write,
And letters where my tears have washt a wannish white.

RHYME a b a b b c c

See see the Chariot, and those rushing wheels,
That whirl'd the Prophet up at Chebar flood,
My spirit som transporting Cherub feels,
To bear me where the Towers of Salem stood,
Once glorious Towers, now sunk in guiltles blood;                    
There doth my soul in holy vision sit
In pensive trance, and anguish, and ecstatick fit.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Mine eye hath found that sad Sepulchral rock
That was the Casket of Heav'ns richest store,
And here though grief my feeble hands up-lock,
Yet on the softned Quarry would I score
My plaining vers as lively as before;
For sure so well instructed are my tears,
They would fitly fall in order'd Characters.

RHYME a b a b b c c

I thence hurried on viewles wing,                                    
Take up a weeping on the Mountains wilde,
The gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring
Would soon unboosom all their Echoes milde,
And I (for grief is easily beguild)
Might think th'infection of my sorrows bound,
Had got a race of mourners on som pregnant cloud.

THIS rich Marble doth enterr
The honour'd Wife of Winchester,
A Vicounts daughter, an Earls heir,
Besides what her vertues fair
Added to her noble birth,
More then she could own from Earth.
Summers three times eight save one
She had told, alas too soon,
After so short time of breath,
To house with darknes, and with death.                               
Yet had the number of her days
Bin as compleat as was her praise,
Nature and fate had had no strife
In giving limit to her life.
Her high birth, and her graces sweet,
Quickly found a lover meet;
The Virgin quire for her request
The God that sits at marriage feast;
He at their invoking came
But with a scarce-wel-lighted flame;                                 
And in his Garland as he stood,
Ye might discern a Cipress bud.
Once had the early Matrons run
To greet her of a lovely son,
And now with second hope she goes,
And calls Lucina to her throws;
But whether by mischance or blame
Atropos for Lucina came;
And with remorsles cruelty,
Spoil'd at once both fruit and tree:                                 
The haples Babe before his birth
Had burial, yet not laid in earth,
And the languisht Mothers Womb
Was not long a living Tomb.
So have I seen som tender slip
Sav'd with care from Winters nip,
The pride of her carnation train,
Pluck't up by som unheedy swain,
Who onely thought to crop the flowr
New shot up from vernall showr;                                      
But the fair blossom hangs the head
Side-ways as on a dying bed,
And those Pearls of dew she wears,
Prove to be presaging tears
Which the sad morn had let fall
On her hast'ning funerall.
Gentle Lady may thy grave
Peace and quiet ever have;
After this thy travail sore
Sweet rest sease thee evermore,                                      
That to give the world encrease,
Shortned hast thy own lives lease;
Here besides the sorrowing
That thy noble House doth bring,
Here be tears of perfect moan
Weept for thee in Helicon,
And som Flowers, and som Bays,
For thy Hears to strew the ways,
Sent thee from the banks of Came,
Devoted to thy vertuous name;                                        
Whilst thou bright Saint high sit'st in glory,
Next her much like to thee in story,
That fair Syrian Shepherdess,
Who after yeers of barrennes,
The highly favour'd Joseph bore
To him that serv'd for her before,
And at her next birth much like thee,
Through pangs fled to felicity,
Far within the boosom bright
of blazing Majesty and Light,                                        
There with thee, new welcom Saint,
Like fortunes may her soul acquaint,
With thee there clad in radiant sheen,
No Marchioness, but now a Queen.

The labour of an age in piled Stones,
Or that his hallow'd reliques should be hid

Dear son of memory, great heir of Fame,
What need'st thou such weak witnes of thy name?
Thou in our wonder and astonishment
Hast built thy self a live-long Monument.
For whilst to th'sharne of slow-endeavouring art,
Thy easie numbers flow, and that each heart                          
Hath from the Leaves of thy unvalu'd Book,
Those Delphick lines with deep impression took,
Then thou our fancy of it self bereaving,
Dost make us Marble with too much conceaving;
And so Sepulcher'd in such pomp dost lie,
That Kings for such a Tomb would wish to die.

HERE lies old Hobson, Death hath broke his girt,
And here alas, hath laid him in the dirt,
Or els the ways being foul, twenty to one,
He's here stuck in a slough, and overthrown.
'Twas such a shifter, that if truth were known,
Death was half glad when he had got him down;
For he had any time this ten yeers full,
Dodg'd with him, betwixt Cambridge and the Bull.
And surely, Death could never have prevail'd,
Had not his weekly cours of carriage fail'd;                         
But lately finding him so long at home,
And thinking now his journeys end was come,
And that he had tane up his latest Inne,
In the kind office of a Chamberlin
Shew'd him his room where he must lodge that night,
Pull'd off his Boots, and took away the light:
If any ask for him, it shall be sed,
Hobson has supt, and 's newly gon to bed.

HERE lieth one who did most truly prove,
That he could never die while he could move,
So hung his destiny never to rot
While he might still jogg on, and keep his trot,
Made of sphear-metal, never to decay
Untill his revolution was at stay.
Time numbers motion, yet (without a crime
'Gainst old truth) motion number'd out his time:
And like an Engin mov'd with wheel and waight,
His principles being ceast, he ended strait.                         
Rest that gives all men life, gave him his death,
And too much breathing put him out of breath;
Nor were it contradiction to affirm
Too long vacation hastned on his term.
Meerly to drive the time away he sickn'd,
Fainted, and died, nor would with Ale be quickn'd;
Nay, quoth he, on his swooning bed out-stretch'd,
If I may not carry, sure Ile ne're be fetch'd,
But vow though the cross Doctors all stood hearers,
For one Carrier put down to make six bearers.                        
Ease was his chief disease, and to judge right,
He di'd for heavines that his Cart went light,
His leasure told him that his time was com,
And lack of load, made his life burdensom
That even to his last breath (ther be that say't)
As he were prest to death, he cry'd more waight;
But had his doings lasted as they were,
He had bin an immortall Carrier.
Obedient to the Moon he spent his date
In cours reciprocal, and had his fate                                
Linkt to the mutual flowing of the Seas,
Yet (strange to think) his wain was his increase:
His Letters are deliver'd all and gon,
Onely remains this superscription.

As ragged as thy Locks,
But com thou Goddes fair and free,
In Heav'n ycleap'd Euphrosyne,
And by men, heart-easing Mirth,
Whom lovely Venus at a birth
With two sister Graces more
To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;

And fresh-blown Roses washt in dew,
Fill'd her with thee a daughter fair,
So bucksom, blith, and debonair.
Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee
Jest and youthful Jollity,
Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,
Nods, and Becks, and Wreathed Smiles,
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,

And Laughter holding both his sides.

And in thy right hand lead with thee,

In unreproved pleasures free;

And singing startle the dull night,

Then to com in spight of sorrow,
And at my window bid good morrow,

While the Cock with lively din,
Scatters the rear of darknes thin,                                   
And to the stack, or the Barn dore,
Stoutly struts his Dames before,
Oft list'ning how the Hounds and horn
Chearly rouse the slumbring morn,
>From the side of som Hoar Hill,
Through the high wood echoing shrill.
Som time walking not unseen
By Hedge-row Elms, on Hillocks green,
Right against the Eastern gate,
Wher the great Sun begins his state,                                 
Rob'd in flames, and Amber light,
The clouds in thousand Liveries dight.
While the Plowman neer at hand,
Whistles ore the Furrow'd Land,
And the Milkmaid singeth blithe,
And the Mower whets his sithe,
And every Shepherd tells his tale
Under the Hawthorn in the dale.
Streit mine eye hath caught new pleasures
Whilst the Lantskip round it measures,                               
Russet Lawns, and Fallows Gray,
Where the nibling flocks do stray,
Mountains on whose barren brest
The labouring clouds do often rest:
Meadows trim with Daisies pide,
Shallow Brooks, and Rivers wide.

Wher perhaps som beauty lies,
The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes.                                   
Hard by, a Cottage chimney smokes,
>From betwixt two aged Okes,
Where Corydon and Thyrsis met,
Are at their savory dinner set
Of Hearbs, and other Country Messes,
Which the neat-handed Phillis dresses;
And then in haste her Bowre she leaves,
With Thestylis to bind the Sheaves;
Or if the earlier season lead
To the tann'd Haycock in the Mead,                                   
Som times with secure delight
The up-land Hamlets will invite,
When the merry Bells ring round,
And the jocond rebecks sound
To many a youth, and many a maid,
Dancing in the Chequer'd shade;
And young and old com forth to play
On a Sunshine Holyday,
Till the live-long day-light fail,
Then to the Spicy Nut-brown Ale,                                    
With stories told of many a feat,
How Faery Mab the junkets eat,
She was pincht, and pull'd she sed,
And he by Friars Lanthorn led
Tells how the drudging Goblin swet,
To ern his Cream-bowle duly set,
When in one night, ere glimps of morn,
His shadowy Flale hath thresh'd the Corn
That ten day-labourers could not end,
Then lies him down the Lubbar Fend.                                 
And stretch'd out all the Chimney's length,
Basks at the fire his hairy strength;
And Crop-full out of dores he flings,
Ere the first Cock his Mattin rings.
Thus don the Tales, to bed they creep,
By whispering Windes soon lull'd asleep.
Towred Cities please us then,
And the busie humm of men,
Where throngs of Knights and Barons bold,
In weeds of Peace high triumphs hold,                               
With store of Ladies, whose bright eies
Rain influence, and judge the prise
Of Wit, or Arms, while both contend
To win her Grace, whom all commend.
There let Hymen oft appear
In Saffron robe, with Taper clear,
And pomp, and feast, and revelry,
With mask, and antique Pageantry,
Such sights as youthfull Poets dream
On Summer eeves by haunted stream.                                  
Then to the well-trod stage anon,
If Jonsons learned Sock be on,
Or sweetest Shakespear fancies childe,
Warble his native Wood-notes wilde,
And ever against eating Cares,
Lap me in soft Lydian Aires,
Married to immortal verse
Such as the meeting soul may pierce
In notes, with many a winding bout
Of lincked sweetnes long drawn out,                                 
With wanton heed, and giddy cunning,
The melting voice through mazes running;
Untwisting all the chains that ty
The hidden soul of harmony.
That Orpheus self may heave his head
From golden slumber on a bed
Of heapt Elysian flowres, and hear
Such streins as would have won the ear
Of Pluto, to have quite set free
His half regain'd Eurydice.

These delights, if thou canst give,
Mirth with thee, I mean to live.
And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess,
As thick and numberless
As the gay motes that people the Sun Beams,
Or likest hovering dreams
But hail thou Goddess, sage and holy,
Hail divinest Melancholy
Whose Saintly visage is too bright
To hit the Sense of human sight;
And therefore to our weaker view,
Ore laid with black staid Wisdoms hue.
Black, but such as in esteem,
Prince Memnons sister might beseem,
Or that Starr'd Ethiope Queen that strove
To set her beauties praise above                                     
The Sea Nymphs, and their powers offended.
Yet thou art higher far descended,
Thee bright-hair'd Vesta long of yore,
To solitary Saturn bore;
His daughter she (in Saturns raign,
Such mixture was not held a stain)
Oft in glimmering Bowres, and glades
He met her, and in secret shades
Of woody Ida's inmost grove,
While yet there was no fear of Jove.                                 
Com pensive Nun, devout and pure,
Sober, stedfast, and demure,
All in a robe of darkest grain,
Flowing with majestick train,
And sable stole of Cipres Lawn,
Over thy decent shoulders drawn.
Com, but keep thy wonted state,
With eev'n step, and musing gate,
And looks commercing with the skies,
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes:                                 
There held in holy passion still,
Forget thy self to Marble, till
With a sad Leaden downward cast,
Thou fix them on the earth as fast.
And joyn with thee calm Peace, and Quiet,
Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet,
And hears the Muses in a ring,
Ay round about Joves Altar sing.
And adde to these retired Leasure,
That in trim Gardens takes his pleasure;                             
But first, and chiefest, with thee bring,
Him that yon soars on golden wing,
Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne,
The Cherub Contemplation,
And the mute Silence hist along,
'Less Philomel will daign a Song,
In her sweetest, saddest plight,
Smoothing the rugged brow of night,
While Cynthia checks her Dragon yoke,
Gently o're th'accustom'd Oke;                                       
Sweet Bird that shunn'st the noise of folly
Most musical!, most melancholy!
Thee Chauntress oft the Woods among
I woo to hear thy eeven-Song;
And missing thee, I walk unseen
On the dry smooth-shaven Green,
To behold the wandring Moon,
Riding neer her highest noon,
Like one that had bin led astray
Through the Heav'ns wide pathles way;                                
And oft, as if her head she bow'd,
Stooping through a fleecy cloud.
Oft on a Plat of rising ground,
I hear the far-off Curfeu sound,
Over som wide-water'd shoar,
Swinging slow with sullen roar;
Or if the Ayr will not permit,
Som still removed place will fit,
Where glowing Embers through the room
Teach light to counterfeit a gloom                                   
Far from all resort of mirth,
Save the Cricket on the hearth,
Or the Belmans drowsie charm,
To bless the dores from nightly harm:
Or let my Lamp at midnight hour,
Be seen in som high lonely Towr,
Where I may oft out-watch the Bear,
With thrice great Hermes, or unsphear
The spirit of Plato to unfold
What Worlds, or what vast Regions hold                               
The immortal mind that hath forsook
Her mansion in this fleshly nook:
And of those Daemons that are found
In fire, air, flood, or under ground,
Whose power hath a true consent
With planet or with Element.
Som time let Gorgeous Tragedy
In Scepter'd Pall com sweeping by,
Presenting Thebs, or Pelops line,
Or the tale of Troy divine.                                         
Or what (though rare) of later age,
Ennobled hath the Buskind stage.
But, O sad Virgin, that thy power
Might raise Musaeus from his bower,
Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing
Such notes as warbled to the string,
Drew Iron tears down Pluto's cheek,
And made Hell grant what Love did seek.
Or call up him that left half told
The story of Cambuscan bold,                                        
Of Camball, and of Algarsife,
And who had Canace to wife,
That own'd the vertuous Ring and Glass,
And of the wondrous Hors of Brass,
On which the Tartar King did ride;
And if ought els, great Bards beside,
In sage and solemn tunes have sung,
Of Turneys and of Trophies hung;
Of Forests, and inchantments drear,
Where more is meant then meets the ear.                             
Thus night oft see me in thy pale career,
Till civil-suited Morn appeer,
Not trickt and frounc't as she was wont,
With the Attick Boy to hunt,
But Cherchef't in a comly Cloud,
While rocking Winds are Piping loud,
Or usher'd with a shower still,
When the gust hath blown his fill,
Ending on the russling Leaves,
With minute drops from off the Eaves.                               
And when the Sun begins to fling
His flaring beams, me Goddes bring
To arched walks of twilight groves,
And shadows brown that Sylvan loves
Of Pine, or monumental Oake,
Where the rude Ax with heaved stroke,
Was never heard the Nymphs to daunt,
Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt.
There in close covert by som Brook,
Where no profaner eye may look,                                     
Hide me from Day's garish eie,
While the Bee with Honied thie,
That at her flowry work doth sing,
And the Waters murmuring
With such consort as they keep,
Entice the dewy-feather'd Sleep;
And let som strange mysterious dream,
Wave at his Wings in Airy stream,
Of lively portrature display'd,
Softly on my eye-lids laid.                                         
And as I wake, sweet musick breath
Above, about, or underneath,
Sent by som spirit to mortals good,
Or th'unseen Genius of the Wood.
But let my due feet never fail,
To walk the studious Cloysters pale,
And love the high embowed Roof
With antick Pillars massy proof,
And storied Windows richly dight,
Casting a dimm religious light.                                     
There let the pealing Organ blow,
To the full voic'd Quire below,
In Service high, and Anthems cleer,
As may with sweetnes, through mine ear,
Dissolve me into extasies,
And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes.
And may at last my weary age
Find out the peacefull hermitage,
The Hairy Gown and Mossy Cell,
Where I may sit and rightly spell                                   
Of every Star that Heav'n doth shew,
And every Herb that sips the dew;
Till old  experience do attain
To somthing like prophetic strain.
These pleasures Melancholy give,
And I with thee will choose to live.

GEN. Stay gentle Swains, for though in this disguise,
I see bright honour sparkle through your eyes,
Of famous Arcady ye are, and sprung
Of that renowned flood, so often sung,
Divine Alpheus, who by secret sluse,                                 
Stole under Seas to meet his Arethuse;
And ye the breathing Roses of the Wood,
Fair silver-buskind Nymphs as great and good,
I know this quest of yours, and free intent
Was all in honour and devotion ment
To the great Mistres of yon princely shrine,
Whom with low reverence I adore as mine,
And with all helpful service will comply
To further this nights glad solemnity;
And lead ye where ye may more neer behold                            
What shallow-searching Fame hath left untold;
Which I full oft amidst these shades alone
Have sate to wonder at, and gaze upon:
For know by lot from Jove I am the powr
Of this fair wood, and live in Oak'n bowr,
To nurse the Saplings tall, and curl the grove
With Ringlets quaint, and wanton windings wove.
And all my Plants I save from nightly ill,
Of noisom winds, and blasting vapours chill.
And from the Boughs brush off the evil dew,                          
And heal the harms of thwarting thunder blew,
Or what the cross dire-looking Planet smites,
Or hurtfull Worm with canker'd venom bites.
When Eev'ning gray doth rise, I fetch my round
Over the mount, and all this hallow'd ground,
And early ere the odorous breath of morn
Awakes the slumbring leaves, or tasseld horn
Shakes the high thicket, haste I all about,
Number my ranks, and visit every sprout
With puissant words, and murmurs made to bless,                      
But els in deep of night when drowsines
Hath lockt up mortal sense, then listen I
To the celestial Sirens harmony,
That sit upon the nine enfolded Sphears,
And sing to those that hold the vital shears,
And turn the Adamantine spindle round,
On which the fate of gods and men is wound.
Such sweet compulsion doth in musick ly,
To lull the daughters of Necessity,
And keep unsteddy Nature to her law,                                 
And the low world in measur'd motion draw
After the heavenly tune, which none can hear
Of human mould with grosse unpurged ear;
And yet such musick worthiest were to blaze
The peerles height of her immortal praise,
Whose lustre leads us, and for her most fit,
If my inferior hand or voice could hit
Inimitable sounds, yet as we go,
What ere the skill of lesser gods can show,
I will assay, her worth to celebrate,                                
And so attend ye toward her glittering state;
Where ye may all that are of noble stemm
Approach, and kiss her sacred vestures hemm.

Flowers of more mingled hew
Then her purfl'd scarf can shew,
And drenches with Elysian dew

Beds of Hyacinth, and roses
Where young Adonis oft reposes,
Waxing well of his deep wound                                      
In slumber soft, and on the ground
Sadly sits th' Assyrian Queen;

Holds his dear Psyche sweet intranc't
After her wandring labours long,
Till free consent the gods among

Love vertue, she alone is free,
She can teach ye how to clime

HAIL native Language, that by sinews weak
Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak,
And mad'st imperfect words with childish tripps,
Half unpronounc't, slide through my infant-lipps,
Driving dum silence from the portal dore,
Where he had mutely sate two years before:
Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask,
That now I use thee in my latter task:
Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee,
I know my tongue but little Grace can do thee:                       
Thou needst not be ambitious to be first,
Believe me I have thither packt the worst:
And, if it happen as I did forecast,
The daintest dishes shall be serv'd up last.
I pray thee then deny me not thy aide
For this same small neglect that I have made:
But haste thee strait to do me once a Pleasure,
And from thy wardrope bring thy chiefest treasure;
Not those new fangled toys, and triming slight
Which takes our late fantasticks with delight,                       
But cull those richest Robes, and gay'st attire
Which deepest Spirits, and choicest Wits desire:
I have some naked thoughts that rove about
And loudly knock to have their passage out;
And wearie of their place do only stay
Till thou hast deck't them in thy best aray;
That so they may without suspect or fears
Fly swiftly to this fair Assembly's ears;
Yet I had rather if I were to chuse,
Thy service in some graver subject use,                              
Such as may make thee search thy coffers round
Before thou cloath my fancy in fit sound:
Such where the deep transported mind may scare
Above the wheeling poles, and at Heav'ns dore
Look in, and see each blissful Deitie
How he before the thunderous throne doth lie,
Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings
To th'touch of golden wires, while Hebe brings
Immortal Nectar to her Kingly Sire:
Then passing through the Spherse of watchful fire,                   
And mistie Regions of wide air next under,
And hills of Snow and lofts of piled Thunder,
May tell at length how green-ey'd Neptune raves,
In Heav'ns defiance mustering all his waves;
Then sing of secret things that came to pass
When Beldam Nature in her cradle was;
And last of Kings and Queens and Hero's old,
Such as the wise Demodocus once told
In solemn Songs at King Alcinous feast,
While sad Ulisses soul and all the rest                              
Are held with his melodious harmonie
In willing chains and sweet captivitie.
But fie my wandring Muse how thou dost stray !
Expectance calls thee now another way,
Thou know'st it must he now thy only bent
To keep in compass of thy Predicament:
Then quick about thy purpos'd business come,
That to the next I may resign my Roome
Good luck befriend thee Son; for at thy birth
The Faiery Ladies daunc't upon the hearth;                           
Thy drowsie Nurse hath sworn she did them spie
Come tripping to the Room where thou didst lie;
And sweetly singing round about thy Bed
Strew all their blessings on thy sleeping Head.
She heard them give thee this, that thou should'st still
From eyes of mortals walk invisible,
Yet there is something that doth force my fear,
For once it was my dismal hap to hear
A Sybil old, bow-bent with crooked age,
That far events full wisely could presage,
And in Times long and dark Prospective Glass
Fore-saw what future dayes should bring to pass,
Your Son, said she, (nor can you it prevent)
Shall subject be to many an Accident.
O're all his Brethren he shall Reign as King,
Yet every one shall make him underling,
And those that cannot live from him asunder
Ungratefully shall strive to keep him under,
In worth and excellence he shall out-go them,
Yet being above them, he shall be below them;                        
From others he shall stand in need of nothing,
Yet on his Brothers shall depend for Cloathing.
To find a Foe it shall not be his hap,
And peace shall lull him in her flowry lap;
Yet shall he live in strife, and at his dore
Devouring war shall never cease to roare;
Yea it shall be his natural property
To harbour those that are at enmity.
What power, what force, what mighty spell, if not
Your learned hands, can loose this Gordian knot?                     
Rivers arise; whether thou be the Son,
Of utmost Tweed, or Oose, or gulphie Dun,
Or Trent, who like some earth-born Giant spreads
His thirty Armes along the indented Meads,
Or sullen Mole that runneth underneath,
Or Severn swift, guilty of Maidens death,
Or Rockie Avon, or of Sedgie Lee,
Or Coaly Tine, or antient hallowed Dee,
Or Humber loud that keeps the Scythians Name,
Or Medway smooth, or Royal Towred Thame.

When I behold thy Heavens, thy Fingers art,
The Moon and Starrs which thou so bright hast set,                   
In the pure firmament, then saith my heart,
O What is man that thou remembrest yet,

RHYME a b a b

And think'st upon him; or of man begot
That him thou visit'st and of him art found;
Scarce to be less then Gods, thou mad'st his lot,
With honour and with state thou hast him crown'd.

RHYME a b a b

O're the works of thy hand thou mad'st him Lord,
Thou hast put all under his lordly feet,
All Flocks, and Herds, by thy commanding word,
All beasts that in the field or forrest meet.                        

RHYME a b a b

Fowl of the Heavens, and Fish that through the wet
Sea-paths in shoals do slide. And know no dearth.

   A Vine from Aegypt thou hast brought,
    Thy free love made it thine,

RHYME a b a b

   Thou did'st prepare for it a place

  Her branches on the western side

  Why hast thou laid her Hedges low
    And brok'n down her Fence,                          
    That all may pluck her, as they go,
    With rudest violence?

RHYME a b a b

    Wild Beasts there brouze, and make their food
    Her Grapes and tender Shoots.

RHYME a b a b

  Return now, God of Hosts, look down
    From Heav'n, thy Seat divine,

RHYME a b a b

  But now it is consum'd with fire,

   When trouble did thee sore assaile,
    On me then didst thou call,

    With clouds encompass'd round;

  Then would I soon bring down their foes

    There Seated in his Sanctuary,
    His Temple there is plac't.

RHYME a b a b

   Sions fair Gates the Lord loves more
    Then all the dwellings faire
    Of Jacobs Land, though there be store,
    And all within his care.

RHYME a b a b

   City of God, most glorious things
    Of thee abroad are spoke;                    
   I mention Egypt, where proud Kings
    Did our forefathers yoke,

RHYME a b a b

    I mention Babel to my friends,
    Philistia full of scorn,
    And Tyre with Ethiops utmost ends,
    Lo this man there was born:

RHYME a b a b

   But twise that praise shall in our ear
    Be said of Sion last
    This and this man was born in her,
    High God shall fix her fast.                 

RHYME a b a b

   The Lord shall write it in a Scrowle
    That ne're shall be out-worn
    When he the Nations doth enrowle
    That this man there was born.

RHYME a b a b

   Both they who sing, and they who dance
    With sacred Songs are there,
    In thee fresh brooks, and soft streams glance
    And all my fountains clear.

RHYME a b a b

   LORD God that dost me save and keep,
    All day to thee I cry;
    And all night long, before thee weep
    Before thee prostrate lie.

RHYME a b a b

   Into thy presence let my praier
    With sighs devout ascend
    And to my cries, that ceaseless are,
    Thine ear with favour bend.

RHYME a b a b

   For cloy'd with woes and trouble store
    Surcharg'd my Soul doth lie,                 
    My life at death's uncherful dore
    Unto the grave draws nigh.

RHYME a b a b

   Reck'n'd I am with them that pass
    Down to the dismal pit
    I am a *man, but weak alas               
    And for that name unfit.                     

RHYME a b a b

   From life discharg'd and parted quite
    Among the dead to sleep
    And like the slain in bloody fight
    That in the grave lie deep.                  

RHYME a b a b

    Whom thou rememberest no more,
    Dost never more regard,
    Them from thy hand deliver'd o're
    Deaths hideous house hath barr'd.

RHYME a b a b

   Thou in the lowest pit profound'
    Hast set me all forlorn,
    Where thickest darkness hovers round,
    In horrid deeps to mourn.

RHYME a b a b

   Thy wrath from which no shelter saves
    Full sore doth press on me;                  
   *Thou break'st upon me all thy waves,         
   *And all thy waves break me                   

RHYME a b a b

   Thou dost my friends from me estrange,
    And mak'st me odious,
    Me to them odious, for they change,
    And I here pent up thus.

RHYME a b a b

   Through sorrow, and affliction great
    Mine eye grows dim and dead,
    Lord all the day I thee entreat,
    My hands to thee I spread.                   

RHYME a b a b

  Wilt thou do wonders on the dead,
    Shall the deceas'd arise
    And praise thee from their loathsom bed
    With pale and hollow eyes ?

RHYME a b a b

  Shall they thy loving kindness tell
    On whom the grave hath hold,
    Or they who in perdition dwell
    Thy faithfulness unfold?

RHYME a b a b

  In darkness can thy mighty hand
    Or wondrous acts be known,                   
    Thy justice in the gloomy land
    Of dark oblivion?

RHYME a b a b

  But I to thee O Lord do cry
    E're yet my life be spent,
    And up to thee my praier doth hie
    Each morn, and thee prevent.

RHYME a b a b

  Why wilt thou Lord my soul forsake,
    And hide thy face from me,
  That am already bruis'd, and *shake          
    With terror sent from thee;                  

RHYME a b a b

    Bruz'd, and afflicted and so low
    As ready to expire,
    While I thy terrors undergo
    Astonish'd with thine ire.

RHYME a b a b

  Thy fierce wrath over me doth flow
    Thy threatnings cut me through.
  All day they round about me go,
    Like waves they me persue.

RHYME a b a b

  Lover and friend thou hast remov'd
    And sever'd from me far.                     
    They fly me now whom I have lov'd,
    And as in darkness are.

RHYME a a *

WHEN I beheld the Poet blind, yet bold,
In slender Book his vast Design unfold,
Messiah Crown'd, Gods Reconcil'd Decree,
Rebelling Angels, the Forbidden Tree,
Heav'n, Hell, Earth, Chaos, All; the Argument
Held me a while misdoubting his Intent,
That he would ruine (for I saw him strong)
The sacred Truths to Fable and old Song
(So Sampson groap'd the Temples Posts in spight)
The World o'rewhelming to revenge his sight.

RHYME a a *

Yet as I read soon growing less severe,
I lik'd his Project, the success did fear;
Through that wide Field how he his way should find
O're which lame Faith leads Understanding blind;
Lest he perplex'd the things he would explain,
And what was easie he should render vain.

RHYME a a *

Or if a Work so infinite he spann'd,
Jealous I was that some less skilful hand
(Such as disquiet always what is well,
And by ill imitating would excell)
Might hence presume the whole Creations day
To change in Scenes. and show it in a Play.

RHYME a a *

Pardon me, Mighty Poet, nor despise
My causeless, yet not impious, surmise.
But I am now convinc'd, and none will dare
Within thy Labours to pretend a share,
Thou hast not miss'd one thought that could be fit,
And all that was improper dost omit:
So that no room is here for Writers left,
But to detect their Ignorance or Theft.

RHYME a a *

That Majesty which through thy Work doth Reign
Draws the Devout, deterring the Profane,
And things divine thou treatst of in such state
As them preserves, and thee, inviolate.
At once delight and horrour on us seise,
Thou singst with so much gravity and ease;

RHYME a a *

And above humane flight dost soar aloft
With Plume so strong, so equal, and so soft.
The Bird nam'd from that Paradise you sing
So never flaggs, but always keeps on Wing.

RHYME a a *

Where couldst thou words of such a compass find?
Whence furnish such a vast expence of mind?
Just Heav'n thee like Tiresias to requite
Rewards with Prophesie thy loss of sight.

RHYME a a *

Well mightst thou scorn thy Readers to allure
With tinkling Rhime, of thy own sense secure;
While the Town-Bayes writes all the while and spells,
And like a Pack-horse tires without his Bells:
Their Fancies like our Bushy-points appear,
The Poets tag them, we for fashion wear.
I too transported by the Mode offend,
And while I meant to Praise thee must Commend.
Thy Verse created like thy Theme sublime,
In Number, Weight, and Measure, needs not Rhime.

Fly envious Time till thou run out thy race
call on the lazie leaden-stepping howres
whose speed is but the heavie plummets pace
& glut thy selfe wth what thy womb devoures
Wch is no more then what is false & vaine
& meerly mortall drosse
so little is our losse

for when as each thing bad thou hast entomb'd
& last of all thy greedie selfe consum'd                             
then long Aeternity shall greet our blisse
wth an individuall kisse
and Joy shall overtake us as a flood
when every thing yt is sincerely good
& pfectly divine
with Truth, & Peace, & Love shall ever shine
about the supreme throne
of him t' whose happy-making sight alone
when once our heav'nly-guided soule shall clime
then all this earthie grossnesse quit                                
attir'd wth starres wee shall for ever sit
Triumphing over Death, & Chance, & thee O Time.

O Nightingale, that on yon bloomy Spray
Warbl'st at eeve, when all the Woods are still,
Thou with fresh hope the Lovers heart dost fill,
While the jolly hours lead on propitious May,
Thy liquid notes that close the eye of Day,
First heard before the shallow Cuccoo's bill
Portend success in love; O if Jove's will
Have linkt that amorous power to thy soft lay,
Now timely sing, ere the rude Bird of Hate
Foretell my hopeles doom in som Grove ny:                            
As thou from yeer to yeer hast sung too late
For my relief; yet hadst no reason why,
Whether the Muse, or Love call thee his mate,
Both them I serve, and of their train am I.

TITLE Luminarium Poems

RHYME a a b c c b

Wise men alway,
Affirm and say,
That best 'tis for a man,
Diligently,
For to apply
The business that he can;

RHYME a a b c c b

And in no wise
To enterprise
Another faculty,
For he that will
And can no skill
Is never like to thrive           

RHYME a a b c c b

He that hath left
The hosier's craft,
And falleth to making shone,
The smith that shall
To painting fall,
His thrift is well-nigh done.

RHYME a a b c c b

A black draper
With white paper,
To go to writing school,
An old butler
Become a cutler,
I ween shall prove a fool.

RHYME a a b c c b

And an old trot,
That can God wot
Nothing but kiss the cup,
With her physic,
Will keep one sick,
Till she have soused him up.

RHYME a a b c c b

A man of law,
That never saw
The ways to buy and sell,
Weening to rise
By merchandise,
I pray God speed him well.

RHYME a a b c c b

A merchant eke
That will go seek,
By all the means he may,
To fall in suit
Till he dispute
His money clean away;

RHYME a a b c c b

Pleading the law
For every straw,
Shall prove a thrifty man
With 'bate and strife,
But by my life
I cannot tell you whan.

RHYME a a b c c b

When an hatter
Will go smatter
In philosophy,
Or a pedlar
Were a meddler
In theology,

RHYME a a b c c b

All that ensue
Such craftes new,
They drive so far a cast,
That evermore
They do therefore
Beshrew themselves at last.

RHYME a a b c c b

This thing was tried
And verified
Here by a serjeant late
That thriftly was,
Or he could pass,
Rapped about the pate,

RHYME a a b c c b

While that he would
See how he could
In God's name play the frere;
Now if you will
Know how it fell
Take heed and ye shall hear.

RHYME a a b c c b

It happed so
Not long ago
A thrifty man there died,
An hundred pound
Of nobles round,
That had he laid aside.

RHYME a a b c c b

His son he would
Should have this gold
For to begin withal;
But to suffice
This child, well thrice
That money was too small.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet ere this day
I have heard say,
That many a man certes
Hath with good cast
Be rich at last,
That hath begun with less.

RHYME a a b c c b

But this young man
So well began
His money to employ,
That certainly
His policy,
To see it was a joy.

RHYME a a b c c b

For lest some blast
Might overcast
His ship, or by mischance,
Men with some wile
Might him beguile
And 'minish his substance,

RHYME a a b c c b

For to put out
All manner doubt,
He made a good purvey
For ev'ry whit
By his own wit
And took another way.

RHYME a a b c c b

First fair and well
Thereof much deal
He digg'd it in a pot,
But then he thought
That way was nought
And there he left it not.

RHYME a a b c c b

So was he fain
From thence again
To put it in a cup;
And by and by
Covetously
He supped it fairly-up.

RHYME a a b c c b

In his own breast
He thought it best
His money to inclose,
Then wist he well
Whatever fell
He could it never lose.

RHYME a a b c c b

He borrow'd then
Of other men
Money and merchandise,
Never paid it,
Up he laid it
In like manner wise.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet on the gear
That he would wear
He rought not what he spent,
So it were nice,
As for the price
Could him not miscontent.

RHYME a a b c c b

With lusty sport
And with resort
Of joly company
In mirth and play
Full many a day
He lived merrily.

RHYME a a b c c b

And men had sworn
Some man is born
To have a lucky hour,
And so was he,
For such degree
He gat and such honour,

RHYME a a b c c b

That without doubt
When he went out,
A serjeant well and fair
Was ready strait
On him to wait
As soon as on the may'r;

RHYME a a b c c b

But he doubtless
Of his meekness
Hated such pomp and pride
And would not go
Companied so
But drew himself aside.

RHYME a a b c c b

To Saint Cath'rine
Strait as a line
He gat him at a tide,
For devotion
Or promotion
There would he needs abide.

RHYME a a b c c b

There spent he fast
Till all was past
And to him came there many
To ask their debt
But none could get
The value of a penny.

RHYME a a b c c b

With visage stout
He bare it out
Even unto the hard hedge,
A month or twain,
Till he was fain
To lay his gown to pledge.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then was he there
In greater fear
Than ere that he came thither,
And would as fain
Depart again
But that he wist not whither.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then after this
To a friend of his
He went, and there abode,
Whereas he lay
So sick alway
He might not come abroad.

RHYME a a b c c b

It happed than
A merchant man
That he ow'd money to
Of an officer
Then 'gan enquire
What him was best to do.

RHYME a a b c c b

And he ans'red,
" Be not afraid
Take an action therefore
I you behest,
I shall him 'rest
And then care for no more."

RHYME a a b c c b

I fear quoth he
It will not be
For he will not come out.
The sergeant said
" Be not afraid
It shall be brought about.

RHYME a a b c c b

In many a game
Like to the same
Have I been well in ure,
And for your sake
Let me be bake
But if I do this cure."

RHYME a a b c c b

Thus part they both,
And forth then go'th
Apace this officer
And for a day
All his array
He changed with a frere.

RHYME a a b c c b

So was he dight
That no man might
Him for a frere deny
He dopp'd and dook'd
He spake and look'd
So religiously.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet in a glass
Ere he would pass
He toted and he peer'd
His heart for pride
Leapt in his side
To see how well he frer'd.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then forth apace
Unto the place
He goeth in God's name
To do this deed;
But now take heed,
For here begins the game.

RHYME a a b c c b

He drew him nigh
And softily
Straight at the door he knock'd
And a damsel
That heard him well
There came and it unlock'd.

RHYME a a b c c b

The friar said
God speed fair maid
Here lodgeth such a man
It is told me;
Well Sir, quoth she,
And if he do what than?

RHYME a a b c c b

Quoth he, mistress
No harm doubtless,
It 'longeth for our order
To hurt no man,
But as we can
Every wight to farther.

RHYME a a b c c b

With him truly
Fain speak would I.
Sir, quoth she, by my fai
He is so sick
Ye be not like
To speak with him to-day.

RHYME a a b c c b

Quoth he, fair mai
Yet I you pray
This much at my desire
Vouchsafe to do,
As go him to
And say an Austin friar

RHYME a a b c c b

Would with him speak
And matters break
For his avail certain.
Quoth she, I will
Stand you here still
Till I come down again.

RHYME a a b c c b

Up did she go
And told him so
As she was bid to say.
He mistrusting
No manner thing
Said, maiden go thy way

RHYME a a b c c b

And fetch him hither
That we together
May talk.  Adown she go'th.
Up she him brought
No harm she thought
But it made some folk wroth.

RHYME a a b c c b

This officer
This feigned frere
When he was come aloft
He dopped than
And greet this man
Religiously and oft.

RHYME a a b c c b

And he again
Right glad and fain
Took him there by the hand,
The friar then said
You be dismay'd
With trouble I understand.

RHYME a a b c c b

Indeed, quoth he,
It hath with me
Been better than it is.
Sir, quoth the frere,
Be of good cheer,
Yet shall it after this.

RHYME a a b c c b

For Christ his sake
Look that you take
No thought within your breast;
God may turn all,
And so he shall
I trust, unto the best.

RHYME a a b c c b

But I would now
Commune with you,
In counsel if you please,
Or elles not,
Of matters that
Shall set your heart at ease.

RHYME a a b c c b

Down went the maid,
The merchant said
Now say-on gentle frere,
Of this tiding
That you me bring
I long full sore to hear.

RHYME a a b c c b

When there was none
But they alone
The friar with evil grace
Said, I 'rest thee,
Come on with me,
And out he took his mace.

RHYME a a b c c b

Thou shalt obey
Come on thy way
I have thee in my clutch
Thou go'st not hence
For all the pence
The may'r hath in his pouch.

RHYME a a b c c b

This merchant there,
For wrath and fear
He waxing-well nigh wood,
Said, whoreson thief,
With a mischief,
Who hath taught thee thy good.

RHYME a a b c c b

And with his fist
Upon the list
He gave him such a blow
That backward down
Almost in swoon
The friar did overthrow.

RHYME a a b c c b

Yet was this man
Well fearder than
Lest he the fri'r had slain
Till with good raps
And heavy claps
He dawde him up again.

RHYME a a b c c b

The friar took heart
And up he start
And well he laid about
And so there go'th
Between them both
Many a lusty clout.

RHYME a a b c c b

They rent and tear
Each others hair
And clave together fast
Till with lugging
And with tugging
They fell down both at last.

RHYME a a b c c b

Then on the ground
Together round
With many a sad stroke
They roll and rumble,
They turn and tumble
As pigs do in a poke.

RHYME a a b c c b

So long above
They heave and shove
Together, that at last
The maid and wife
To break the strife
Hied them upward fast.

RHYME a a b c c b

And when they spy
The captain's lie
Both weltring on the place
The friar's hood
They pull'd agood
Adown about his face.

RHYME a a b c c b

While he was blind
The wench behind
Lent him laid on the floor
Many a joll
About the noul
With a great battledoor.

RHYME a a b c c b

The wife came yet
And with her feet
She holpe to keep him down
And with her rock
Many a knock
She gave him on the crown.

RHYME a a b c c b

They laid his mace
About his face
That he was wood for pain
The friar frap
Gat many a swap,
Till he was full nigh slain.

RHYME a a b c c b

Up they him lift
And with ill thrift
Headlong along the stair
Down they him threw
And said adieu,
Commend us to the may'r.

RHYME a a b c c b

The friar arose
But I suppose
Amazed was his head
He shook his ears
And from great fears
He thought him well afled.

RHYME a a b c c b

Quoth he, now lost
Is all this cost
We be never the near,
Ill must he theeh
That caused me
To make myself a frere.

RHYME a a b c c b

Now masters all
Here now I shall
End there as I began,
In anywise
I would advise
And counsel ev'ry man,

RHYME a a b c c b

His own craft use
All new refuse
And lightly let them gone
Play not the frere;
Now make good cheer,
And welcome ev'ry chone.

TITLE A Rueful Lamentation

RHYME a b a b b c c

O ye that put your trust and confidence,
In worldly joy and frail prosperity,
That so live here as ye should never hence,
Remember death and look here upon me.
Ensaumple I think there may no better be.
Yourself wotte well that in this realm was I,
Your queen but late, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Was I not born of old worthy lineage?
Was not my mother queen my father king?
Was I not a king’s fere  in marriage?
Had I not plenty of every pleasant thing?
Merciful god this is a strange reckoning:
Riches, honor, wealth, and ancestry
Hath me forsaken and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

If worship might have kept me, I had not gone.
If wit might have me saved, I needed not fear.
If money might have holpe, I lacked none.
But O good God what vaileth  all this gere. 
When death is come thy mighty messenger,
Obey we must there is no remedy,
Me hath he summoned, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Yet was I late promised otherwise,
This year to live in wealth and delice.
Lo where to cometh thy blandishing promise,
O false astrology devynatrice,
Of goddes secrets making thyself so wise?
How true for this year thy prophecy?
The year yet lasteth, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

O brittle wealth, ay full of bitterness,
Thy single pleasure doubled is with pain.
Account my sorrow first and my distress,
In sundry wise, and reckon there again,
The joy that I have had, and I dare sayne.
For all my honor, endured yet have I,
More woe than wealth, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Where are our castles, now where are our Towers?
Goodly Richmond son art thou gone from me,
At Westminster that costly work of yours,
Mine own dear lord now shall I never see.
Almighty god vouchsafe to grant that ye,
For you and your children well may edify.
My palace builded is, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Adieu mine own dear spouse my worthy lord,
The faithful love, that did us both combine,
In marriage and peaceable concord,
Into your hands here I clean resign
To be bestowed upon your children and mine.
Erst were you father, and now must ye supply,
The mothers part also, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Farewell my daughter lady Margaret.
God wotte full oft it grieved hath my mind,
That ye should go where we should seldom meet.
Now am I gone, and have left you behind.
O mortal folk that we be very blind,
That we least fear, full oft it is most nye,
From you depart I first, and lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Farewell Madam my lords worthy mother,
Comfort your son, and be ye of good cheer,
Take all a worth, for it will be no nother.
Farewell my daughter Katherine late the fere, 
To prince Arthur mine own child so dear,
It booteth not for me to weep and cry,
Pray for my soul, for now lo here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Thy mother never know, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Lady Cicily Anne and Katherine,
Farewell my well-beloved sisters three.
O lady Briget other sister mine,
Lo here the end of worldly vanity.
Now well are ye that earthly folly flee,
And heavenly things love and magnify,
Farewell and pray for me, for lo now here I lie.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Adieu my lords, adieu my ladies all,
Adieu my faithful servants every chone, 
Adieu my commons whom I never shall,
See in this world wherefore to the alone,
Immortal god verily three and one,
I me commend thy infinite mercy,
Show to thy servant, for lo now here I lie. 

TITLE Words of Fortune

RHYME a b a b b c c

 Mine high estate power and auctoritie,
If ye ne know, enserche and ye shall spye,
That richesse, worship, welth, and dignitie,
Joy, rest, and peace, and all thyng finally,
That any pleasure or profit may come by,
To mannes comfort, ayde, and sustinaunce,
Is all at my devyse and ordinaunce.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Without my favour there is nothyng wonne.
Many a matter have I brought at last,
To good connclusion, that fondly was begonne.
And many a purpose, bounden sure and fast
With wise provision, I have overcast.
Without good happe there may no wit suffise,
Better is to be fortunate than wyse.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And therefore hath there some men bene or this,
My deadly foes and written many a boke,
To my disprayse. And other cause there nys,
But for me list not frendly on them loke,
Thus lyke the fox they fare that once forsoke,
The pleasaunt grapes, and gan for to defy them,
Because he lept and yet could not come by them.

RHYME a b a b b

But let them write theyr labour is in vayne,
For well ye wote, myrth, honour, and richesse,
Much better is than penury and payne.
The nedy wretch that lingereth in distresse,
Without myne helpe is ever comfortlesse,

TITLE Pageant of Life

RHYME a b a b b c c

I am called Childhood, in play is all my mind,
       To cast a quoit, a cokstele and a ball,
A top can I set and drive it in his kind;
       But would to God these hateful bookes all
       Were in a fire burnt to powder small;
Then might I lead my life always in play,
Which life God send me to mine ending day!

RHYME a b a b b c c

Manhood I am, therefore I me delight
       To hunt and hawk, to nourish-up and feed,
The greyhound to the course, the hawk to the flight,
       And to bestride a good and lusty steed—
       These things become a very man indeed.
Yet thinketh this boy his peevish game sweeter,
But what, no force, his reason is no better.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Whoso na knoweth the strength, power, and might,
       Of Venus and me her little son Cupid;
Thou Manhood shalt a mirrour been aright,
       By us subdued for all thy great pride,
       My fiery dart pierceth thy tender side.
Now thou who erst dispisedst children small
Shall wax a child again and be my thrall.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Old age am I, with lockes thin and hoar,
       Of our short life the last and best part,
Wise and discreet; the public weal therefore
       I help to rule, to my labour and smart.
       Therefore Cupid withdraw thy fiery dart.
Chargeable matters shall of love oppress
Thy childish game and idle business.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Though I be foul, ugly, lean, and mishape,
       Yet there is none in all this world wide,
That may my power withstand or escape;
       Therefore sage father, greatly magnified,
       Descend from your chair, set apart your pride,
Vouchsafe to lend, tho' it be to your pain,
To me, a fool, some of your wise brain.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Fame I am called, marvel you nothing,
       Though with tongues am compassed all round,
For in voice of people is my chief living,
       O cruel Death, thy power I confound.
       When thou a noble man hast brought to ground,
Maugre thy teeth, to live cause him shall I
Of people in perpetual memory.
 	
RHYME a b a b b c c

I whom thou sees with horologe in hand,
       Am named Time, the lord of every hour,
I shall in space destroy both sea and land.
       O simple Fame, how darest thou man honour,
       Promising of his name an endless flower;
Who may in the world have a name eternal
When I shall in process destroy the world and all.

RHYME a b a b a a c c

He needeth not to boast, I am Eternity,
       The very name signifieth well,
And mine empire infinite shall be.
       Thou, mortal Time, every man can tell,
Art nothing else but the mobility
Of sun and moon, changing in every degree;
When they shall leave their course, thou shalt be brought,
For all thy pride and boasting, into nought.

TITLE Two Poems

RHYME a b a b b c c

Eye-flattering Fortune! look thou ne'er so fair,
     Or ne'er so pleasantly begin to smile,
As though thou wouldst my ruin all repair,
     During my life thou shalt not me beguile;
     Trust shall I God to enter in erewhile,
His haven of havens sure and uniform:—
After a calm I still expect the storm.*

RHYME a b a b b c c

Long was I, Lady Luck, your serving-man,
     And now have lost again all that I gat;
When, therefore, I think of you now and then,
     And in my mind remember this and that,
     Ye may not blame me, though I shrew your cat;
In faith I bless you, and a thousand times,
For lending me some leisure to make rhymes.

TITLE 12 Properties

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The first point is to love but one alone,
And for that one all others to forsake:
For whoso5 loveth many loveth none:6
The flood that is in many channels take
In each of them shall feeble streams make:
The love that is divided among many
Uneath7 sufficeth that any part have any.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So thou that hast thy love set unto God
In thy remembrance this imprint8 and grave:
As He in sovereign dignity is odd,9
So will He in love no parting fellows10 have:
Love Him therefore with all that He thee gave:
For body, soul, wit, cunning, mind and thought,
Part will He none, but either all or naught.11

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Of his love, lo, the sight and company
To the lover so glad and pleasant is,
That whoso hath the grace to come thereby
He judgeth him in perfect joy and bliss:
And whoso of that company doth miss,
Live he in never so prosperous estate,12
He thinketh him wretched and infortunate.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So should the lover of God esteem that he
Which all the pleasure hath, mirth and disport,
That in this world is possible to be,
Yet till the time that he may once resort
Unto that blessed, joyful, heavenly port
Where he of God may have the glorious sight,
Is void of perfect joy and sure delight.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The third point of a perfect lover is
To make him fresh to see that all things been13
Appointed well and nothing set amiss
But all well fashioned, proper, goodly, clean:
That in his person, there be nothing seen
In speech, apparel, gesture, look or pace14
That may offend or diminish15 any grace.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So thou that wilt with God get into favor
Garnish16 thyself up in as goodly wise
As comely17 be, as honest in behaviour,
As it is possible for thee to devise:
I mean not hereby that thou shouldest arise
And in the glass upon thy body prowl,18
But with fair virtue to adorn thy soul.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If love be strong, hot, mighty and fervent,
There may no trouble, grief, or sorrow fall,
But that the lover would be well content
All to endure and think it also19 too small,
Though it were death, so he might therewithal
The joyful presence of that person get
On whom he hath his heart and love set.20

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thus should of God the lover be content
Any distress or sorrow to endure,
Rather than to be from God absent,
And glad to die, so that he may be sure
By his departing hence for to procure,
After this valley dark, the heavenly light,
And of his love the glorious blessed sight.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Not only a lover content is in his heart
But coveteth also and longeth to sustain
Some labor, incommodity,21 or smart,22
Loss, adversity, trouble, grief, or pain:
And of his sorrow joyful is and fain,23
And happy thinketh himself that he may take
Some misadventure24 for his lover's sake.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thus shouldest thou, that lovest God also,
In thine heart wish, covet and be glad
For Him to suffer trouble, pain and woe:
For Whom if thou be never so woe bestead,25
Yet thou ne shalt sustain (be not adread)26
Half the dolour,27 grief and adversity
That He already suffered hath for thee.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The perfect lover longeth for to be
In presence of his love both night and day,
And if it haply so befall that he
May not as he would, he will yet as he may
Ever be with his love, that is to say,
Where his heavy body will not28 be brought
He will be conversant29 in mind and thought.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Lo in like manner the lover of God should,
At the least in such wise as he may,
If he may not in such wise as he would,
Be present with God and conversant always;
For certes, whoso list,30 he may purvey,31
Though all the world would him therefrom bereaven32
To bear his body in earth, his mind in heaven.33

RHYME a b a b b c c 

There is no page or servant, most or least,34
That doth upon his love attend and wait,
There is no little worm, no simple beast,
Nor35 none so small a trifle or conceit,
Lace, girdle, point,36 or proper37 glove strait,38
But that if to his love it has39 been near,
The lover hath40 it precious, lief41 and dear.42

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So every relic, image or picture
That doth pertain to God's magnificence,
The lover of God should with all busy cure43
Have it in love, honor and reverence
And specially give them pre-eminence
Which daily done His blessed body wurche,44
The quick45 relics, the ministers of His Church.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

A very lover above all earthly things
Coveteth and longeth evermore to hear
The honour, laud, commendation and praising,
And everything that may the fame clear46
Of his love: he may in no manner
Endure to hear that therefrom mighten vary
Or anything sound into47 the contrary.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The lover of God should covet in likewise
To hear His honor, worship, laud and praise,
Whose sovereign goodness none heart may comprise,48
Whom hell, earth, and all the heaven obeys,
Whose perfect lover ought by no manner ways
To suffer the cursed words of blasphemy,
Or anything spoken of God unreverently.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

A very lover believeth in his mind
On whomsoever he hath his heart bent,49
That in that person men may nothing find
But honorable, worthy and excellent,
And also50 surmounting far in his intent51
All other that he hath known by sight or name:
And would that every man should think the same.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Of God likewise, so wonderful and high,
All things esteem and judge his lover ought,
So reverence, worship, honor and magnify,52
That all the creatures in this world wrought53
In comparison should he set at nought,
And glad be if he might the mean devise
That all the world would thinken in likewise.54

RHYME a b a b b c c 

The lover is of color dead and pale;
There will no sleep into his eyes stalk;
He favoureth neither meat, wine, nor ale;
He mindeth not what men about him talk;
But eat he, drink he, sit, lie down or walk,
He burneth ever as it were with a fire
In the fervent heat of his desire.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Here should the lover of God example55 take
To have Him continually in remembrance,
With him in prayer and meditation wake,
While others play, revel, sing, and dance:
None earthly joy, disport, or vain plesance56
Should him delight, or anything remove
His ardent mind from God, his heavenly love.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Diversely passioned57 is the lover's heart:
Now pleasant hope, now dread and grievous fear,
Now perfect bliss, now bitter sorrow smart;
And whether his love be with him, or elsewhere,
Oft from his eyes there falleth many a tear,
For very joy, when they together be;
When they be sundered, for adversity.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Like affections58 feeleth also59 the breast
Of God's lover in prayer and meditation:
When that his love liketh in him rest
With inward60 gladness of pleasant contemplation,
Out break the tears for joy and delectation;61
And when his love list eft to part him fro,62
Out break the tears again for pain and woe.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

A very lover will his love obey:
His joy it is and all his appetite
To pain himself in all that ever he may,
That person in whom he set hath his delight63
Diligently to serve both day and night
For very love, without any regard
To any profit, guerdon64 or reward.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

So thou likewise that hast thine heart set65
Upward to God, so well thyself endeavor,
So studiously that nothing may thee let
Not for His service any wise dissever:
Freely look also that thou serve thereto,66 never
Trust of reward or profit do thee bind,
But only faithful heart and loving mind.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Wageless to serve, three things may us move:67
First, if the service self be desirable:
Second, if they whom that we serve and love
Be very good and very, amiable:
Thirdly, of reason be we serviceable
Without the gaping68 after any more
To such as have done much for us before.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Serve God for love, then, not for hope of meed:69
What service may so desirable be
As where all turneth to thine own speed?
Who is so good, so lovely also70 as He
Who hath already done so much for thee,
As He that first thee made, and on the rood71
Eft72 thee redeemèd with His precious blood?

RHYME a b a b b c c 

O holy God of dreadful majesty,
Verily one in three and three in one,
Whom angels serve, Whose work all creatures be,
Which heaven and earth directest all alone,
We Thee beseech, good Lord, with woeful moan,
Spare us wretches and wash away our guilt,
That we be not by Thy just anger spilt.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In strait73 balance of rigorous judgment
If Thou shouldst our sin ponder and weigh:
Who able were to bear Thy punishment?
The whole engine74 of all this world, I say,
The engine that enduren shall for aye,
With such examination might not stand
Space of a moment in Thine angry hand.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Who is not born in sin original?
Who doth not actually sin in sundry wise?
But thou, good Lord, art he that sparest all,
With piteous mercy tempering justice:
For as thou dost reward us device75
About our merit / so dost thou dispense
Thy punishment far under our offence.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

More is thy mercy far than76 all our sin,
To give them also that unworthy be,
More godly is and more mercy therein,
Howbeit worthy enough are they pardee,77
Be they never so unworthy, whom that he
Chooses78 to accept, which where so ever he taketh,
Whom he unworthy findeth, worthy maketh.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Wherefore, Good Lord, that always79 merciful art,
Unto thy grace and sovereign dignity,
We silly80 wretches cry with humble heart
Our sin forgot and our malignity,
With piteous yes of thy benignity,
Friendly look on us once,81 thine own we be,
Servants or sinners whether it liketh thee.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Sinners if thou our crime behold certain,
Our crime the work of our uncourteous82 mind
But if thy gifts thou behold again,
Thy gifts noble, wonderful, and kind,
Thou shalt us then the same persons find,
Which are to thee and have be long space,83
Servants by nature, children by thy grace.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

But this thy goodness wringeth84 us alas,
For we whom grace had made thee children dear,
Are made thy guilty folk by our trespass,
Sin hath us guilty made this many a year,
But let thy grace, thy grace that hath no peer.
Of our offence surmount all the preace,85
That in our sin thine honor may increase.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

For thou, thy wisdom though thy sovereign power,
May otherwise appear sufficiently,
As things which thy creatures every hour,
All with one voice declare and testify,
Thy goodness: yet thy singular mercy,
Thy piteous heart thy gracious indulgence
No thing so clearly showeth as our offence.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

What but our sin hath showed that mighty love,
Which able was thy dreadful majesty,
To draw down into earth from heaven above,
And crucify god, that we poor wretches we,
Should from our filthy sin cleansed86 be,
With blood and water of thine own side,
That streamed from thy blessed wounds wide.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thy love and pity thus, O heavenly King,
Our evil maketh matter of thy goodness,
O love, O pity, our wealth ay providing,
O goodness serving thy servants in distress,
O love, O pity, well nigh now thankless
O goodness mighty gracious and wise,
And yet almost now vanquished with our vice.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Grant I thee pray such heat into mine heart,
That to this love of thine may be egall:87
Grant me from Sathanas88 service to astart,89
With whom me rueth90 so long to have be thrall,91
Grant me good Lord and creator of all,
The flame to quench of all sinful desire,
And in thy love set all mine heart afire.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

That when the journey92 of this deadly life
My silly93 ghost hath finished and thence
Departed must without his94 fleshly wife
Alone into his lord’s high presence
He may thee find: O well of indulgence,
In thy lordship not as a lord: but rather
As a very tender loving father.

TITLE 12 Rules

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Whoso2 to virtue esteems3 hard the way
Because we must have war continual
Against the world, the flesh, the devil,4 that ave
Enforce6 themselves to make us bond and thrall,7
Let him remember that choose what may he shall,
Even after the world,8 yet must he need sustain9
Sorrow, adversity, labor, grief, and pain.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Think10 in this wretched world’s busy woe
The battle more sharp and longer is, I wis11
With more labor and less fruit also
In which the end of labor, labor is.12
And when the world hath left us after this
Void of all virtue: the reward when we die
Is nought but fire and pain perpetually.13

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider well that folly it is and vain
To look for heaven with pleasure and delight.
Since Christ our Lord and sovereign captain
Ascended never but by manly14 fight
And bitter passion; then were it no right
That any servant, ye will yourself record,15
Should stand in better condition than his lord.16

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Think how that we not only should not grudge
But also be glad and joyful of this fight,
And long therefore—although we could not judge
How that thereby redound17 unto us might
Any profit, but only for delight—
To be conformed and like in some behavior
To Jesu Christ our blessed Lord and Savoir.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

As often as thou dost war and strive,
By the resistance of any sinful motion,
Against any of thy sensual wits five,18
Cast in thy mind19 as oft with good devotion
How thou resemblest Christ: as with sour potion
If thou pain thy taste: remember therewithal
How Christ for thee tasted eysell and gall.20

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If thou withdraw thine hands and forbear
The ravishing21 of anything: remember then
How His innocent hands nailed were.
If thou be tempt with pride: think how that when
He was in form of God, yet of a bondman22
He took the shape and humbled Himself for thee
To the most odious and vile death of a tree.23

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider when thou art moved to be wroth24
He Who that was God, and of all men the best,
Seeing Himself scorned and scourged both,
And as a thief between two thieves thrests25
With all rebuke and shame: yet from his breast
Came never sign of wrath or of disdain,
But patiently endured all the pain.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thus every snare and engine26 of the devil
If thou this wise27 peruse28 them by and by
There can be none so cursed or so evil
But to some virtue thou mayst it apply.
For oft thou shalt, resisting valiantly
The fiend’s might and subtle fiery dart,
Our Savior Christ resemble in some part.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Remember well that we in no wise must,
Neither in the foresaid spiritual armor29
Nor any other remedy, put our trust,
But only in the virtue of our Savior:
For He it is by Whose mighty power
The world was vanquished and its prince cast out
Which reigned before in all the earth about.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In Him let us trust to overcome all evil,
In Him let us put our hope and confidence
To subdue the flesh and master the devil,
To Him be all honor and lowly reverence;
Oft should we require with all our diligence
With prayer, with tears, and lamentable plaints
The aid of His grace and His holy saints.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

One sin vanquished, look thou not tarry,
But lie in await for another very hour,30
For as a wood31 lion, the fiend, our adversary,
Runneth about seeking whom he may devour;32
Wherefore continually upon thy tower,33
Lest he thee unpurveyed34 and unready catch,
Thou must with the prophet stand and keep watch.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Enforce35 thyself not only for to stand
Unvanquished against the devil's might,
But over that take valiantly on hand
To vanquish him and put him unto flight:36
And that is when of the same deed, thought or sight
By which he would have thee with sin contract,
Thou takest occasion of some good virtuous act.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Sometime he secretly casteth in thy mind
Some laudable deed to stir thee to pride,
As vainglory maketh many a man blind.
But let humility be thy sure guide,
Thy good work to God let it be applied,
Think it not thine but a gift of His
Of Whose grace undoubtedly all goodness is.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In time of battle so put thyself in preace37
As though thou shouldest after that victory
Enjoy forever a perpetual peace:
For God of His goodness and liberal mercy
May grant the gift, and also thy proud enemy,
Confounded and rebuked by thy battle,
Shall thee no more haply for very shame assail.38

RHYME a b a b b c c 

But when thou mayest once the triumph obtain
Prepare thyself and trim thee in thy gear
As thou shouldest incontinent39 fight again,
For if thou be ready, the devil will thee fear:
Wherefore in any wise so even thou thee bear
That thou remember and have ever in memory
In victory battle, in battle victory.40

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If thou think thyself well fenced and sure
Against every subtle suggestion of vice,
Consider frail glass may no distress endure,
And great adventurers often curse the dice:41
Jeopard not too far42 therefore and ye be wise,
But evermore eschew43 the occasions of sin,
For he that loveth peril shall perish therein.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In all temptation withstand the beginning—
The cursed infants of wretched Babylon!44
To suffer them wax is a jeopardous thing:45
Beat out their brains therefore at the stone:46
Perilous is the canker that catcheth the bone:47
Too late cometh the medicine if thou let the sore
By long continuance increase more and more.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Though in the time of the battle and war
The conflict seem bitter, sharp and sour,
Yet consider it is more pleasure far
Over the devil to be a conqueror
Than is in the use of thy beastly pleasure:
Of virtue more joy the conscience hath within
Than outward the body of all his filthy sin.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

In this point many men err for negligence
For they compare not the joy of the victory
To the sensual pleasure of their concupiscence,48
But like rude beasts unadvisedly
Lacking discretion they compare and apply
Of their foul sin the voluptuous delight
To the laborious travail of the conflict and fight.49

RHYME a b a b b c c 

And yet alas he that oft hath known
What grief it is by long experience
Of his cruel enemy to be overthrown,
Should once at the leastwise do his diligence
To prove and essay50 with manly defense
What pleasure there is, what honor, peace and rest
In glorious victory, triumph and conquest.51

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Though thou be tempted, despair thee nothing:
Remember the glorious apostle Saint Paul
When he had seen God in His perfect being,
Lest such revelation should his heart extol,
His flesh was suffered to rebel against his soul:52
This did almighty God of His goodness provide
To preserve His servant from the danger of pride.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

And here take heed that he whom God did love,
And for His most especial vessel chose,
Ravished into the third heaven above,
Yet stood in peril lest pride might him depose:
Well ought we then our hearts fence and close
Against vainglory, the mother of reprief,53
The very crop and root of all mischief.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Against this pomp and wretched worlds gloss
Consider how Christ the Lord, sovereign power,
Humbled Himself for us unto the cross:
And peradventure death within one hour
Shall us bereave wealth, riches and honor:
And bring us down full low both small and great
To vile carrion and wretched worms meat.

TITLE 12 Weapons

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider well the pleasure that thou hast,
Stand it in touching or in wanton sight,1
In vain smell or in thy licorous2 taste,
Or finally, in whatsoever delight
Occupied is thy wretched appetite:
Thou shalt it find, when thou hast all cast,3
Little, simple, short and suddenly past.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Any good work if thou with labor do,
The labor goeth, the goodness doth remain:
If thou do evil with pleasure joined thereto,
The pleasure which thine evil work doth contain
Glideth his way, thou must him not restrain:
The evil then in thy breast cleaveth behind
With grudge of heart and heaviness of mind.4

RHYME a b a b b c c 

When thou laborest thy pleasure for to buy
Upon the price look thou well thee advise,
Thou sellest thy soul therefore even by and by
To thy most utter despiteous5 enemies:6
O mad merchant, O foolish merchandise,
To buy a trifle, O childish reckoning,
And pay therefore so dear a precious thing!

RHYME a b a b b c c 

This wretched life, the trust and confidence
Of whose continuance maketh us bold to sin,
Thou perceivest well by experience,
Since that hour in which it did begin,
It holdeth on the course and will not lin,7
But fast it runneth on and passen shall
As doth a dream or shadow on the wall.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Consider well that ever night and day,
While that we busily provide and care
For our disport,8 revel, mirth and play,
For pleasant melody and dainty fare,
Death stealeth on full slyly and unaware:
He lieth at hand and shall us enterprise9
We know not how soon nor in what manner wise.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

If thou shouldst God offend, think how therefore
Thou were forthwith10 in very jeopardous11 case:
For haply thou shouldst not live an hour more
Thy sin to cleanse, and though thou haddest space,
Yet peradventure shouldst thou lack the grace:
Well ought we then be feared to do offence
Impenitent lest we departen hence.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Thou seest this world is but a thoroughfare,12
See thou behave thee wisely with thine host;13
Hence must thou needs depart naked and bare,
And after thy desert look to what cost
Thou art conveyed at such time as thy ghost14
From this wretched carcass shall dissever:15
Be it joy or pain, endure it shall forever.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Remember how God hath made thee reasonable
Like unto His image and figure,16
And for thee suffered pains intolerable17
That He, for an angel, never would endure.18
Regard, O man, thine excellent nature;19
Thou that with angels art made to be equal,20
For very shame be not the devil's thrall.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Why lovest thou so this brittle21 world’s joy?
Take all the mirth, take all the fantasies,
Take every game, take every wanton toy,
Take every sport that men can thee devise:
And among them all on warrantise22
Thou shalt no pleasure comparable find
To th' inward gladness of a virtuous mind.23

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Beside that God thee bought24 and formed both
Many a benefit hast thou received of His:
Though thou have moved Him often to be wroth25
Yet He thee kept hath and brought thee up to this,
And daily calleth upon thee to His bliss:
How mayst thou then to Him unloving be
That ever hath been so loving unto thee?

RHYME a b a b b c c 

When thou in flame of the temptation friest
Think on the very lamentable pain,
Think on the piteous cross of woeful Christ,
Think on His blood beat out at every vein,
Think on His precious heart carved in twain,26
Think how for thy redemption all was wrought:
Let Him not lose thee that He so dear hath bought.

RHYME a b a b b c c 

Sin to withstand say not thou lackest might:
Such allegations27 folly it is to use;28
The witness of saints, and martyrs' constant sight
Shall thee of slothful29 cowardice accuse:
God will thee help if thou do not refuse:
If other have stood30 or,31 this thou mayst eftsoon:32
Nothing impossible is that hath been done.

TITLE Rape of the Lock

RHYME a a *

  What dire offence from amorous causes springs,
  What mighty contests rise from trivial things,
  I sing--This verse to CARYL, Muse! is due:
  This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:
  Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,                 
  If She inspire, and He approve my lays.

RHYME a a *

  Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel
  A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?
  O say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,
  Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?                  
  In tasks so bold, can little men engage,
  And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?

RHYME a a *

  Sol thro' white curtains shot a timorous ray,
  And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:
  Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,           
  And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:
  Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,
  And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.
  Belinda still her downy pillow prest,
  Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest:              
  'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed
  The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head;
  A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,
  (That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)
  Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,                
  And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.

RHYME a a *

  Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care
  Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!
  If e'er one vision touch.'d thy infant thought,
  Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;          
  Of airy Elves by moonlight shadows seen,
  The silver token, and the circled green,
  Or virgins visited by Angel-pow'rs,
  With golden crowns and wreaths of heav'nly flow'rs;
  Hear and believe! thy own importance know,                
  Nor bound thy narrow views to things below.
  Some secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,
  To Maids alone and Children are reveal'd:
  What tho' no credit doubting Wits may give?
  The Fair and Innocent shall still believe.                
  Know, then, unnumber'd Spirits round thee fly,
  The light Militia of the lower sky:
  These, tho' unseen, are ever on the wing,
  Hang o'er the Box, and hover round the Ring.
  Think what an equipage thou hast in Air,                  
  And view with scorn two Pages and a Chair.
  As now your own, our beings were of old,
  And once inclos'd in Woman's beauteous mould;
  Thence, by a soft transition, we repair
  From earthly Vehicles to these of air.                    
  Think not, when Woman's transient breath is fled
  That all her vanities at once are dead;
  Succeeding vanities she still regards,
  And tho' she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.
  Her joy in gilded Chariots, when alive,                   
  And love of Ombre, after death survive.
  For when the Fair in all their pride expire,
  To their first Elements their Souls retire:
  The Sprites of fiery Termagants in Flame
  Mount up, and take a Salamander's name.                   
  Soft yielding minds to Water glide away,
  And sip, with Nymphs, their elemental Tea.
  The graver Prude sinks downward to a Gnome,
  In search of mischief still on Earth to roam.
  The light Coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,               
  And sport and flutter in the fields of Air.

RHYME a a *

  "Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste
  Rejects mankind, is by some Sylph embrac'd:
  For Spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease
  Assume what sexes and what shapes they please.            
  What guards the purity of melting Maids,
  In courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,
  Safe from the treach'rous friend, the daring spark,
  The glance by day, the whisper in the dark,
  When kind occasion prompts their warm desires,            
  When music softens, and when dancing fires?
  'Tis but their Sylph, the wise Celestials know,
  Tho' Honour is the word with Men below.

RHYME a a *

  Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,
  For life predestin'd to the Gnomes' embrace.              
  These swell their prospects and exalt their pride,
  When offers are disdain'd, and love deny'd:
  Then gay Ideas crowd the vacant brain,
  While Peers, and Dukes, and all their sweeping train,
  And Garters, Stars, and Coronets appear,                  
  And in soft sounds, Your Grace salutes their ear.
  'T is these that early taint the female soul,
  Instruct the eyes of young Coquettes to roll,
  Teach Infant-cheeks a bidden blush to know,
  And little hearts to flutter at a Beau.                   

RHYME a a *

  Oft, when the world imagine women stray,
  The Sylphs thro' mystic mazes guide their way,
  Thro' all the giddy circle they pursue,
  And old impertinence expel by new.
  What tender maid but must a victim fall                   
  To one man's treat, but for another's ball?
  When Florio speaks what virgin could withstand,
  If gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?
  With varying vanities, from ev'ry part,
  They shift the moving Toyshop of their heart;         
  Where wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,
  Beaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.
  This erring mortals Levity may call;
  Oh blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.

RHYME a a *

  Of these am I, who thy protection claim,              
  A watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.
  Late, as I rang'd the crystal wilds of air,
  In the clear Mirror of thy ruling Star
  I saw, alas! some dread event impend,
  Ere to the main this morning sun descend,             
  But heav'n reveals not what, or how, or where:
  Warn'd by the Sylph, oh pious maid, beware!
  This to disclose is all thy guardian can:
  Beware of all, but most beware of Man!"

RHYME a a *

  He said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,  
  Leap'd up, and wak'd his mistress with his tongue.
  'T was then, Belinda, if report say true,
  Thy eyes first open'd on a Billet-doux;
  Wounds, Charms, and Ardors were no sooner read,
  But all the Vision vanish'd from thy head.

  And now, unveil'd, the Toilet stands display'd,
  Each silver Vase in mystic order laid.
  First, rob'd in white, the Nymph intent adores,
  With head uncover'd, the Cosmetic pow'rs.

RHYME a a *

  A heav'nly image in the glass appears,                
  To that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;
  Th' inferior Priestess, at her altar's side,
  Trembling begins the sacred rites of Pride.
  Unnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here
  The various off'rings of the world appear;            
  From each she nicely culls with curious toil,
  And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil.

RHYME a a *

  This casket India's glowing gems unlocks,
  And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.
  The Tortoise here and Elephant unite,                 
  Transformed to combs, the speckled, and the white.
  Here files of pins extend their shining rows,
  Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.

RHYME a a *

  Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms;
  The fair each moment rises in her charms,             
  Repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace,
  And calls forth all the wonders of her face;
  Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,
  And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.
  The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,          
  These set the head, and those divide the hair,
  Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown:
  And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own.

RHYME a a *

  Not with more glories, in th' etherial plain,
  The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main,
  Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams
  Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames.
  Fair Nymphs, and well-drest Youths around her shone.          
  But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.
  On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore,
  Which Jews might kiss, and Infidels adore.
  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,
  Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:               
  Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;
  Oft she rejects, but never once offends.
  Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,
  And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.
  Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,           
  Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to hide:
  If to her share some female errors fall,
  Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.

RHYME a a *

  This Nymph, to the destruction of mankind,
  Nourish'd two Locks, which graceful hung behind           
  In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck
  With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck.
  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,
  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.
  With hairy springes we the birds betray,                  
  Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,
  Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,
  And beauty draws us with a single hair.

RHYME a a *

  Th' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd;
  He saw, he wish'd, and to the prize aspir'd.              
  Resolv'd to win, he meditates the way,
  By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;
  For when success a Lover's toil attends,
  Few ask, if fraud or force attain'd his ends.

RHYME a a *

  For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implor'd               
  Propitious heav'n, and ev'ry pow'r ador'd,
  But chiefly Love--to Love an Altar built,
  Of twelve vast French Romances, neatly gilt.
  There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;
  And all the trophies of his former loves;                 
  With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre,
  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.
  Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes
  Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:
  The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,         
  The rest, the winds dispers'd in empty air.

RHYME a a *

  But now secure the painted vessel glides,
  The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides:
  While melting music steals upon the sky,
  And soften'd sounds along the waters die;                 
  Smooth flow the waves, the Zephyrs gently play,
  Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay.
  All but the Sylph--with careful thoughts opprest,
  Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast.
  He summons strait his Denizens of air;                    
  The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:
  Soft o'er the shrouds aerial whispers breathe,
  That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath.
  Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,
  Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;            
  Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,
  Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light,
  Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,
  Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew,
  Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies,                
  Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,
  While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings,
  Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.
  Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,
  Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd;                   
  His purple pinions op'ning to the sun,
  He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun.

RHYME a a *

  Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear!
  Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and Daemons, hear!
  Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd            
  By laws eternal to th' aerial kind.
  Some in the fields of purest AEther play,
  And bask and whiten in the blaze of day.
  Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high,
  Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky.              
  Some less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light
  Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,
  Or suck the mists in grosser air below,
  Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,
  Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,               
  Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.
  Others on earth o'er human race preside,
  Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:
  Of these the chief the care of Nations own,
  And guard with Arms divine the British Throne.

  Our humbler province is to tend the Fair,
  Not a less pleasing, tho' less glorious care;
  To save the powder from too rude a gale,
  Nor let th' imprison'd-essences exhale;
  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs;            
  To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs
  A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,
  Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;
  Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,
  To change a Flounce, or add a Furbelow.

  This day, black Omens threat the brightest Fair,
  That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care;

  Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,            
  Or some frail China jar receive a flaw;
  Or stain her honour or her new brocade;
  Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade;
  Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;
  Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall.    
  Haste, then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:
  The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care;
  The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;
  And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;
  Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite Lock;           
  Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.

  To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,
  We trust th' important charge, the Petticoat:
  Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,
  Tho' stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;  
  Form a strong line about the silver bound,
  And guard the wide circumference around.

RHYME a a *

  Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,
  His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,
  Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,    
  Be stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;
  Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie,
  Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye:
  Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain,
  While clogg'd he beats his silken wings in vain;      
  Or Alum styptics with contracting pow'r
  Shrink his thin essence like a rivel'd flow'r:
  Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel
  The giddy motion of the whirling Mill,
  In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow,             
  And tremble at the sea that froths below!

  He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;
  Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;
  Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;
  Some hang upon the pendants of her ear:               
  With beating hearts the dire event they wait,
  Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.

  Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flow'rs,
  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,
  There stands a structure of majestic frame,
  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.
  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom                
  Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home;
  Here thou, great ANNA! whom three realms obey.
  Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes Tea.

  Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,
  To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court;                 
  In various talk th' instructive hours they past,
  Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;
  One speaks the glory of the British Queen,
  And one describes a charming Indian screen;
  A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;              
  At ev'ry word a reputation dies.
  Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,
  With singing, laughing, ogling, and _all that_.

  Mean while, declining from the noon of day,
  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;                 
  The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign,
  And wretches hang that jury-men may dine;
  The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace,
  And the long labours of the Toilet cease.
  Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,                 
  Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights,
  At Ombre singly to decide their doom;
  And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.
  Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,
  Each band the number of the sacred nine.

  Soon as she spreads her hand, th' aerial guard
  Descend, and sit on each important card:
  First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,
  Then each, according to the rank they bore;
  For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,            
  Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.
  Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd,
  With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;
  And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r,
  Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r;              
  Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,
  Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;
  And particolour'd troops, a shining train,
  Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.

  The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care:            
  Let Spades be trumps! she said, and trumps they were.

RHYME a a *

  Now move to war her sable Matadores,
  In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.
  Spadillio first, unconquerable Lord!
  Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.          
  As many more Manillio forc'd to yield,
  And march'd a victor from the verdant field.
  Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard
  Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card.
  With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,              
  The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,
  Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd,
  The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.
  The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,
  Proves the just victim of his royal rage.                 
  Ev'n mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew
  And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu,
  Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,

  Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;

  His warlike Amazon her host invades,

  The Club's black Tyrant first her victim dy'd,
  Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride:           
  What boots the regal circle on his head,

  That long behind he trails his pompous robe,
  And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?

  The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;                   
  Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face,
  And his refulgent Queen, with pow'rs combin'd
  Of broken troops an easy conquest find.
  Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,
  With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.           
  Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs,
  Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,
  With like confusion different nations fly,
  Of various habit, and of various dye,
  The pierc'd battalions dis-united fall,                   
  In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.

  The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,
  And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.
  At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,
  A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;               
  She sees, and trembles at th' approaching ill,
  Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille.
  And now (as oft in some distemper'd State)
  On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate.
  An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen             
  Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:
  He springs to Vengeance with an eager pace,
  And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.
  The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;
  The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.

  For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,    
  The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;
  On shining Altars of Japan they raise
  The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:
  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,
  While China's earth receives the smoking tide:        
  At once they gratify their scent and taste,
  And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.
  Straight hover round the Fair her airy band;
  Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,
  Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,     
  Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.
  Coffee, (which makes the politician wise,
  And see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes)
  Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain
  New Stratagems, the radiant Lock to gain.             
  Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere't is too late,
  Fear the just Gods, and think of Scylla's Fate!
  Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air,
  She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair!

  But when to mischief mortals bend their will,         
  How soon they find fit instruments of ill!
  Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace
  A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case:
  So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight,
  Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.         
  He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends
  The little engine on his fingers' ends;
  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,
  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.
  Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair,          
  A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;
  And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear;
  Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.
  Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought
  The close recesses of the Virgin's thought;           
  As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd,
  He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her mind,
  Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,
  An earthly Lover lurking at her heart.
  Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd,         
  Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd.

  The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide,
  T' inclose the Lock; now joins it, to divide.
  Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd,
  A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd;               
  Fate urg'd the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,
  (But airy substance soon unites again)
  The meeting points the sacred hair dissever
  From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!

  Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,      
  And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.
  Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast,
  When husbands, or when lapdogs breathe their last;
  Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high,
  In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie!

  Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine
  (The victor cry'd) the glorious Prize is mine!
  While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,
  Or in a coach and six the British Fair,
  As long as Atalantis shall be read,                   
  Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed,
  While visits shall be paid on solemn days,
  When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,
  While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,
  So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!       
  What Time would spare, from Steel receives its date,
  And monuments, like men, submit to fate!
  Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy,
  And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy;
  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,       
  And hew triumphal arches to the ground.
  What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel,
  The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel?

  But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd,
  And secret passions labour'd in her breast.
  Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive,
  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,
  Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss,                  
  Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss,
  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,
  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry,

  For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew
  And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,
  Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,
  As ever sully'd the fair face of light,

  Repair'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen.

  Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome,
  And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome.
  No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,
  The dreaded East is all the wind that blows.              
  Here in a grotto, shelter'd close from air,
  And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare,
  She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,
  Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head.

  Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,            
  But diff'ring far in figure and in face.
  Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid,
  Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd;
  With store of pray'rs, for mornings, nights, and noons,
  Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons.

  There Affectation, with a sickly mien,

  On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,                
  Wrapt in a gown, for sickness, and for show.

  Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise;               
  Dreadful, as hermit's dreams in haunted shades,
  Or bright, as visions of expiring maids.
  Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,
  Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:
  Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,                 
  And crystal domes, and angels in machines.

  Unnumber'd throngs on every side are seen,
  Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen.
  Here living Tea-pots stand, one arm held out,
  One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:            
  A Pipkin there, like Homer's Tripod walks;

  Safe past the Gnome thro' this fantastic band,            
  A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand.
  Then thus address'd the pow'r: "Hail, wayward Queen!
  Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:
  Parent of vapours and of female wit,
  Who give th' hysteric, or poetic fit,                     
  On various tempers act by various ways,
  Make some take physic, others scribble plays;
  Who cause the proud their visits to delay,
  And send the godly in a pet to pray.
  A nymph there is, that all thy pow'r disdains,            
  And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.
  But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace,
  Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,
  Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame,
  Or change complexions at a losing game;                   
  If e'er with airy horns I planted heads,
  Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,
  Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude,
  Or discompos'd the head-dress of a Prude,
  Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease,                  
  Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:
  Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin,
  That single act gives half the world the spleen."

  The Goddess with a discontented air
  Seems to reject him, tho' she grants his pray'r.          
  A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds,
  Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;
  There she collects the force of female lungs,
  Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.
  A Vial next she fills with fainting fears,                
  Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.
  The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,
  Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.

  Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found,
  Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.                   
  Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent,
  And all the Furies issu'd at the vent.
  Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,
  And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.
  "O wretched maid!" she spread her hands, and cry'd,       
  (While Hampton's echoes, "Wretched maid!" reply'd)
  "Was it for this you took such constant care
  The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?
  For this your locks in paper durance bound,
  For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around?        
  For this with fillets strain'd your tender head,
  And bravely bore the double loads of lead?
  Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,
  While the Fops envy, and the Ladies stare!
  Honour forbid! at whose unrivall'd shrine             
  Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign.
  Methinks already I your tears survey,
  Already hear the horrid things they say,
  Already see you a degraded toast,
  And all your honour in a whisper lost!                
  How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?
  'T will then be infamy to seem your friend!
  And shall this prize, th' inestimable prize,
  Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes,
  And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays,        
  On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?
  Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow,
  And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;
  Sooner let earth, air, sea, to Chaos fall,
  Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!"

  She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,
  And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs;
  (Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,
  And the nice conduct of a clouded cane)
  With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,         
  He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case,
  And thus broke out--"My Lord, why, what the devil?
  "Z--ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!
  Plague on't!'t is past a jest--nay prithee, pox!
  Give her the hair"--he spoke, and rapp'd his box.

  "It grieves me much" (reply'd the Peer again)
  "Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.
  But by this Lock, this sacred Lock I swear,
  (Which never more shall join its parted hair;
  Which never more its honours shall renew,             
  Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew)
  That while my nostrils draw the vital air,
  This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear."

  But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so;
  He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow.
  Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,
  Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears;
  On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head,           
  Which, with a sigh, she rais'd; and thus she said.
  "For ever curs'd be this detested day,
  Which snatch'd my best, my fav'rite curl away!
  Happy! ah ten times happy had I been,
  If Hampton-Court these eyes had never seen!           
  Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,
  By love of Courts to num'rous ills betray'd.
  Oh had I rather un-admir'd remain'd
  In some lone isle, or distant Northern land;
  Where the gilt Chariot never marks the way,           
  Where none learn Ombre, none e'er taste Bohea!
  There kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye,
  Like roses, that in deserts bloom and die.
  What mov'd my mind with youthful Lords to roam?
  Oh had I stay'd, and said my pray'rs at home!         
  'T was this, the morning omens seem'd to tell,
  Thrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;
  The tott'ring China shook without a wind.
  Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!
  A Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of fate,         
  In mystic visions, now believ'd too late!
  See the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!
  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares:
  These in two sable ringlets taught to break,
  Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;             
  The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,
  And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;
  Uncurl'd it hangs, the fatal shears demands,
  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands.
  Oh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize           
  Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!"

  She said: the pitying audience melt in tears.

  In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,
  For who can move when fair Belinda fails?
  Not half so fix'd the Trojan could remain,                    
  While Anna begg'd and Dido rag'd in vain.
  Then grave Clarissa graceful wav'd her fan;
  Silence ensu'd, and thus the nymph began.

RHYME a a *

  "Say why are Beauties prais'd and honour'd most,
  The wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast?         
  Why deck'd with all that land and sea afford,
  Why Angels call'd, and Angel-like ador'd?
  Why round our coaches crowd the white-glov'd Beaux,
  Why bows the side-box from its inmost rows;
  How vain are all these glories, all our pains,            
  Unless good sense preserve what beauty gains:
  That men may say, when we the front-box grace:
  'Behold the first in virtue as in face!'
  Oh! if to dance all night, and dress all day,
  Charm'd the small-pox, or chas'd old-age away;            
  Who would not scorn what housewife's cares produce,
  Or who would learn one earthly thing of use?
  To patch, nay ogle, might become a Saint,
  Nor could it sure be such a sin to paint.
  But since, alas! frail beauty must decay,                 
  Curl'd or uncurl'd, since Locks will turn to grey;
  Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,
  And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;
  What then remains but well our pow'r to use,
  And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose?              
  And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,
  When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.
  Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;
  Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul."

  "To arms, to arms!" the fierce Virago cries,
  And swift as lightning to the combat flies.
  All side in parties, and begin th' attack;
  Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;      
  Heroes' and Heroines' shouts confus'dly rise,
  And bass, and treble voices strike the skies.
  No common weapons in their hands are found,

TITLE An Essay on Criticism

RHYME a a *

  'Tis hard to say, if greater want of skill
  Appear in writing or in judging ill;
  But, of the two, less dang'rous is th' offence
  To tire our patience, than mislead our sense.
  Some few in that, but numbers err in this,                      
  Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss;
  A fool might once himself alone expose,
  Now one in verse makes many more in prose.

RHYME a a *

  'Tis with our judgments as our watches, none
  Go just alike, yet each believes his own.                   
  In Poets as true genius is but rare,
  True Taste as seldom is the Critic's share;
  Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light,
  These born to judge, as well as those to write.
  Let such teach others who themselves excel,                 
  And censure freely who have written well.
  Authors are partial to their wit, 'tis true,
  But are not Critics to their judgment too?

RHYME a a *

  Yet if we look more closely, we shall find
  Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind:

  Nature to all things fix'd the limits fit,
  And wisely curb'd proud man's pretending wit.
  As on the land while here the ocean gains,
  In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains;                 
  Thus in the soul while memory prevails,
  The solid pow'r of understanding fails;
  Where beams of warm imagination play,
  The memory's soft figures melt away.
  One science only will one genius fit;                       
  So vast is art, so narrow human wit:
  Not only bounded to peculiar arts,
  But oft in those confin'd to single parts.
  Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before,
  By vain ambition still to make them more;                   
  Each might his sev'ral province well command,

  First follow Nature, and your judgment frame
  By her just standard, which is still the same:
  Unerring NATURE, still divinely bright,                     
  One clear, unchang'd, and universal light,
  Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,
  At once the source, and end, and test of Art.
  Art from that fund each just supply provides,
  Works without show, and without pomp presides:              
  In some fair body thus th' informing soul
  With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,
  Each motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains;
  Itself unseen, but in th' effects, remains.
  Some, to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse,               
  Want as much more, to turn it to its use;
  For wit and judgment often are at strife,
  Tho' meant each other's aid, like man and wife.
  'T is more to guide, than spur the Muse's steed;
  Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;

  Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,
  When to repress, and when indulge our flights:
  High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,
  And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;              
  Held from afar, aloft, th' immortal prize,
  And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise.
  Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n,
  She drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n.
  The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire,             
  And taught the world with reason to admire.
  Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid prov'd,
  To dress her charms, and make her more belov'd:
  But following wits from that intention stray'd,
  Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;         
  Against the Poets their own arms they turn'd,
  Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.
  So modern 'Pothecaries, taught the art
  By Doctor's bills to play the Doctor's part,
  Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,                 
  Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.
  Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,
  Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.
  Some drily plain, without invention's aid,
  Write dull receipts how poems may be made.              
  These leave the sense, their learning to display,

  A perfect Judge will read each work of Wit
  With the same spirit that its author writ:
  Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find       
  Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;
  Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,
  The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with Wit.
  But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow,
  Correctly cold, and regularly low,                     
  That shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep,
  We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.
  In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts
  Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts;
  'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,                
  But the joint force and full result of all.
  Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,
  (The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!)
  No single parts unequally surprize,
  All comes united to th' admiring eyes;

  And if the means be just, the conduct true,
  Applause, in spight of trivial faults, is due;
  As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,
  T' avoid great errors, must the less commit:

  Once on a time, La Mancha's Knight, they say,
  A certain bard encount'ring on the way,
  Discours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage,
  As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage;             
  Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools,
  Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.
  Our Author, happy in a judge so nice,
  Produc'd his Play, and begg'd the Knight's advice;
  Made him observe the subject, and the plot,            
  The manners, passions, unities; what not?
  All which, exact to rule, were brought about,
  Were but a Combat in the lists left out.
  "What! leave the Combat out?" exclaims the Knight;
  Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.                
  "Not so, by Heav'n" (he answers in a rage),

  And hide with ornaments their want of art.
  True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd,
  What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;

  That gives us back the image of our mind.

  Where-e'er you find "the cooling western breeze,"      
  In the next line, it "whispers through the trees:"
  If crystal streams "with pleasing murmurs creep,"
  The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with "sleep:"
  Then, at the last and only couplet fraught

  Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:

  The treach'rous colours the fair art betray,
  And all the bright creation fades away!

  Unhappy Wit, like most mistaken things,
  Atones not for that envy which it brings.             
  In youth alone its empty praise we boast,
  But soon the short-liv'd vanity is lost:
  Like some fair flow'r the early spring supplies.
  That gaily blooms, but ev'n in blooming dies.
  What is this Wit, which must our cares employ?        
  The owner's wife, that other men enjoy;
  Then most our trouble still when most admir'd,
  And still the more we give, the more requir'd;
  Whose fame with pains we guard, but lose with ease,
  Sure some to vex, but never all to please;            
  'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun,
  By fools't is hated, and by knaves undone!

  If Wit so much from Ign'rance undergo,
  Ah let not Learning too commence its foe!
  Of old, those met rewards who could excel,            
  And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well:
  Tho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due,
  Crowns were reserv'd to grace the soldiers too,
  Now, they who reach Parnassus' lofty crown,
  Employ their pains to spurn some others down;         
  And while self-love each jealous writer rules,
  Contending wits become the sport of fools:
  But still the worst with most regret commend,
  For each ill Author is as bad a Friend.
  To what base ends, and by what abject ways,           
  Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise!
  Ah ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boast,
  Nor in the Critic let the Man be lost.

  To err is human, to forgive, divine.

  Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind;

  As shameful sure as Impotence in love.
  In the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease
  Sprung the rank weed, and thriv'd with large increase:
  When love was all an easy Monarch's care;
  Seldom at council, never in a war:
  Jilts rul'd the state, and statesmen farces writ;
  Nay wits had pensions, and young Lords had wit:
  The Fair sate panting at a Courtier's play,           
  And not a Mask went unimprov'd away:
  The modest fan was lifted up no more,
  And Virgins smil'd at what they blush'd before.
  The following licence of a Foreign reign
  Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain;              
  Then unbelieving priests reform'd the nation,
  And taught more pleasant methods of salvation;
  Where Heav'n's free subjects might their rights dispute,
  Lest God himself should seem too absolute:
  Pulpits their sacred satire learn'd to spare,         
  And Vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there!
  Encourag'd thus, Wit's Titans brav'd the skies,
  And the press groan'd with licens'd blasphemies.
  These monsters, Critics! with your darts engage,
  Here point your thunder, and exhaust your rage!       
  Yet shun their fault, who, scandalously nice,
  Will needs mistake an author into vice;
  All seems infected that th' infected spy,

  Fear most to tax an Honourable fool,

  Such, without wit, are Poets when they please,        
  As without learning they can take Degrees.
  Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful Satires,
  And flattery to fulsome Dedicators,
  Whom, when they praise, the world believes no more,
  Than when they promise to give scribbling o'er.       
  'T is best sometimes your censure to restrain,
  And charitably let the dull be vain:
  Your silence there is better than your spite,

  Still humming on, their drowsy course they keep,      
  And lash'd so long, like tops, are lash'd asleep.
  False steps but help them to renew the race,
  As, after stumbling, Jades will mend their pace.

  But in low numbers short excursions tries:
  Content, if hence th' unlearn'd their wants may view,
  The learn'd reflect on what before they knew:         
  Careless of censure, nor too fond of fame;
  Still pleas'd to praise, yet not afraid to blame,
  Averse alike to flatter, or offend;
  Not free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.

TITLE Essay on Man

RHYME a a *

        Awake, my ST. JOHN! leave all meaner things
        To low ambition, and the pride of Kings.
        Let us (since Life can little more supply
        Than just to look about us and to die)
        Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man;               
        A mighty maze! but not without a plan;
        A Wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;
        Or Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.
        Together let us beat this ample field,
        Try what the open, what the covert yield;            
        The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore
        Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;
        Eye Nature's walks, shoot Folly as it flies,
        And catch the Manners living as they rise;
        Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;         
        But vindicate the ways of God to Man.

RHYME a a *

      Say first, of God above, or Man below,
        What can we reason, but from what we know?
        Of Man, what see we but his station here,
        From which to reason, or to which refer?             
        Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,
        'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.
        He, who thro' vast immensity can pierce,
        See worlds on worlds compose one universe,
        Observe how system into system runs,                 
        What other planets circle other suns,
        What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry star,
        May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are.
        But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,
        The strong connexions, nice dependencies,            
        Gradations just, has thy pervading soul
        Look'd thro'? or can a part contain the whole?

        Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less?
        Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made

        And all that rises, rise in due degree;
        Then, in the scale of reas'ning life, 'tis plain,
        There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man:

        In God's, one single can its end produce;            
        Yet serves to second too some other use.
        So Man, who here seems principal alone,
        Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,
        Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;
        'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.

        Is now a victim, and now AEgypt's God:
        Then shall Man's pride and dulness comprehend        
        His actions', passions', being's, use and end;
        Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why
        This hour a slave, the next a deity.

        His time a moment, and a point his space.
        If to be perfect in a certain sphere,
        What matter, soon or late, or here or there?

VI.     What would this Man? Now upward will he soar,
        And little less than Angel, would be more;
        Now looking downwards, just as griev'd appears   
        To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.
        Made for his use all creatures if he call,
        Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all?
        Nature to these, without profusion, kind,
        The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd;       
        Each seeming want compensated of course,
        Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;
        All in exact proportion to the state;
        Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.
        Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:       
        Is Heav'n unkind to Man, and Man alone?

        For this plain reason, Man is not a Fly.

        Or quick effluvia darting thro' the brain,
        Die of a rose in aromatic pain?                  
        If Nature thunder'd in his op'ning ears,
        And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres,
        How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still
        The whisp'ring Zephyr, and the purling rill?

        From the green myriads in the peopled grass:   
        What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,
        The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:
        Of smell, the headlong lioness between,
        And hound sagacious on the tainted green:

        To that which warbles thro' the vernal wood:
        The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!
        Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:
        In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true
        From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew?
        How Instinct varies in the grov'lling swine,
        Compar'd, half-reas'ning elephant, with thine!
        'Twixt that, and Reason, what a nice barrier,
        For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near!
        Remembrance and Reflection how ally'd;        
        What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide:
        And Middle natures, how they long to join,
        Yet never pass th' insuperable line!
        Without this just gradation, could they be
        Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?

  The Dog-star rages! nay't is past a doubt,

  Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me;
  Then from the Mint walks forth the Man of rhyme,
  Happy to catch me just at Dinner-time.

  Friend to my Life! (which did not you prolong,

  What _Drop_ or _Nostrum_ can this plague remove?
  Or which must end me, a Fool's wrath or love?              
  A dire dilemma! either way I'm sped,

  That tends to make one worthy man my foe,
  Give Virtue scandal, Innocence a fear,
  Or from the soft-eyed Virgin steal a tear!
  But he who hurts a harmless neighbour's peace,         
  Insults fall'n worth, or Beauty in distress,
  Who loves a Lie, lame slander helps about,
  Who writes a Libel, or who copies out:
  That Fop, whose pride affects a patron's name,
  Yet absent, wounds an author's honest fame:            
  Who can _your_ merit _selfishly_ approve.
  And show the _sense_ of it without the _love_;
  Who has the vanity to call you friend,
  Yet wants the honour, injur'd, to defend;
  Who tells whate'er you think, whate'er you say,        
  And, if he lie not, must at least betray:
  Who to the _Dean_, and _silver bell_ can swear,
  And sees at _Canons_ what was never there;
  Who reads, but with a lust to misapply,
  Make Satire a Lampoon, and Fiction, Lie.               
  A lash like mine no honest man shall dread,
  But all such babbling blockheads in his stead.

  _Sporus_, that mere white curd of Ass's milk?
  Satire or sense, alas! can _Sporus_ feel?              
  Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?
  P. Yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings,
  This painted child of dirt, that stinks and stings;
  Whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys,
  Yet wit ne'er tastes, and beauty ne'er enjoys:         
  So well-bred spaniels civilly delight
  In mumbling of the game they dare not bite.
  Eternal smiles his emptiness betray,
  As shallow streams run dimpling all the way.
  Whether in florid impotence he speaks,                 
  And, as the prompter breathes, the puppet squeaks;
  Or at the ear of _Eve_, familiar Toad,

  _Eve's_ tempter thus the Rabbins have exprest,

  Not Fortune's worshipper, nor fashion's fool,
  Not Lucre's madman, nor Ambition's tool,
  Not proud, nor servile;--be one Poet's praise,
  That, if he pleas'd, he pleas'd by manly ways:         
  That Flatt'ry, ev'n to Kings, he held a shame,
  And thought a Lie in verse or prose the same.
  That not in Fancy's maze he wander'd long,
  But stoop'd to Truth, and moraliz'd his song:
  That not for Fame, but Virtue's better end,            
  He stood the furious foe, the timid friend,
  The damning critic, half approving wit,
  The coxcomb hit, or fearing to be hit;
  Laugh'd at the loss of friends he never had,
  The dull, the proud, the wicked, and the mad;          
  The distant threats of vengeance on his head,
  The blow unfelt, the tear he never shed;
  The tale reviv'd, the lie so oft o'erthrown,
  Th' imputed trash, and dulness not his own;
  The morals blacken'd when the writings scape,          
  The libell'd person, and the pictur'd shape;
  Abuse, on all he lov'd, or lov'd him, spread,
  A friend in exile, or a father, dead;
  The whisper, that to greatness still too near,
  Perhaps, yet vibrates on his SOV'REIGN'S ear:--       
  Welcome for thee, fair _Virtue_! all the past;
  For thee, fair Virtue! welcome ev'n the _last_!
    A. But why insult the poor, affront the great?
  P. A knave's a knave, to me, in ev'ry state:
  Alike my scorn, if he succeed or fail,                 
  _Sporus_ at court, or _Japhet_ in a jail
  A hireling scribbler, or a hireling peer,
  Knight of the post corrupt, or of the shire;
  If on a Pillory, or near a Throne,
  He gain his Prince's ear, or lose his own.             
    Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit,
  _Sappho_ can tell you how this man was bit;
  This dreaded Sat'rist _Dennis_ will confess
  Foe to his pride, but friend to his distress:
  So humble, he has knock'd at _Tibbald's_ door,         
  Has drunk with _Cibber_, nay has rhym'd for _Moore_.
  Full ten years slander'd, did he once reply?
  Three thousand suns went down on _Welsted's_ lie.
  To please a Mistress one aspers'd his life;
  He lash'd him not, but let her be his wife.            
  Let _Budgel_ charge low _Grubstreet_ on his quill,
  And write whate'er he pleas'd, except his Will;
  Let the two _Curlls_ of Town and Court, abuse
  His father, mother, body, soul, and muse.
  Yet why? that Father held it for a rule,               
  It was a sin to call our neighbour fool:
  That harmless Mother thought no wife a whore:
  Hear this, and spare his family, _James Moore!_
  Unspotted names, and memorable long!

  Born to no Pride, inheriting no Strife,

  Resistless falls: the Muse obeys the Pow'r.
  She comes! she comes! the sable Throne behold
  Of _Night_ primaeval and of _Chaos_ old!
  Before her, _Fancy's_ gilded clouds decay,                   
  And all its varying Rain-bows die away.
  _Wit_ shoots in vain its momentary fires,
  The meteor drops, and in a flash expires.
  As one by one, at dread Medea's strain,
  The sick'ning stars fade off th' ethereal plain;         
  As Argus' eyes by Hermes' wand opprest,
  Clos'd one by one to everlasting rest;
  Thus at her felt approach, and secret might,
  _Art_ after _Art_ goes out, and all is Night.
  See skulking _Truth_ to her old cavern fled,             
  Mountains of Casuistry heap'd o'er her head!
  _Philosophy_, that lean'd on Heav'n before,
  Shrinks to her second cause, and is no more.
  _Physic_ of _Metaphysic_ begs defence,
  And _Metaphysic_ calls for aid on _Sense_!               
  See _Mystery_ to _Mathematics_ fly!
  In vain! they gaze, turn giddy, rave, and die.
  _Religion_ blushing veils her sacred fires,

  For _public_ Flame, nor _private_, dares to shine;       
  Nor _human_ Spark is left, nor Glimpse _divine_!
  Lo! thy dread Empire, CHAOS! is restor'd;

First in these fields I try the sylvan strains,
Nor blush to sport on Windsor's blissful plains:
Fair Thames, flow gently from thy sacred spring,
While on thy banks Sicilian Muses sing;
Let vernal airs through trembling osiers play,
And Albion's cliffs resound the rural lay.

RHYME a a *

You that, too wise for pride, too good for power,
Enjoy the glory to be great no more,
And, carrying with you all the world can boast,
To all the world illustriously are lost!           
Oh, let my Muse her slender reed inspire,
Till in your native shades you tune the lyre:
So when the nightingale to rest removes,
The thrush may chant to the forsaken groves,
But, charm'd to silence, listens while she sings,
And all the aerial audience clap their wings.

RHYME a a *

Soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews,
Two swains, whom Love kept wakeful, and the Muse,
Pour'd o'er the whitening vale their fleecy care,
Fresh as the morn, and as the season fair:         
The dawn now blushing on the mountain's side,
Thus Daphnis spoke, and Strephou thus replied.

RHYME a a *

Hear how the birds, on every bloomy spray,
With joyous music wake the dawning day!
Why sit we mute when early linnets sing,

Why sit we sad, when Phosphor] shines so clear,
And lavish Nature paints the purple year?

RHYME a a *

Sing then, and Damon shall attend the strain,
While yon slow oxen turn the furrow'd plain.

Here western winds on breathing roses blow.
I'll stake yon lamb, that near the fountain plays,
And from the brink his dancing shade surveys.

And I this bowl, where wanton ivy twines,
And swelling clusters bend the curling vines:

And what is that, which binds the radiant sky,
Where twelve fair signs in beauteous order lie?

Now hawthorns blossom, now the daisies spring;

Cease to contend, for, Daphnis, I decree,
The bowl to Strephon, and the lamb to thee:
Blest swains, whose nymphs in every grace excel;
Blest nymphs, whose swains those graces sing so well!
Now rise, and haste to yonder woodbine bowers,
A soft retreat from sudden vernal showers;
The turf with rural dainties shall be crown'd.
While opening blooms diffuse their sweets around.
For see! the gath'ring flocks to shelter tend,
And from the Pleiads fruitful showers descend.

RHYME a a *

A shepherd's boy (he seeks no better name)
Led forth his flocks along the silver Thame,
Where dancing sunbeams on the waters play'd,
And verdant alders form'd a quivering shade.
Soft as he mourn'd, the streams forgot to flow,
The flocks around a dumb compassion show:
The Naiads wept in every watery bower,
And Jove consented in a silent shower.

RHYME a a *

Accept, O Garth] the Muse's early lays,
That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays;

From love, the sole disease thou canst not cure.

RHYME a a *

Ye shady beeches, and ye cooling streams,
Defence from Phoebus', not from Cupid's beams,
To you I mourn, nor to the deaf I sing,
'The woods shall answer, and their echo ring.'0]
The hills and rocks attend my doleful lay;
Why art thou prouder and more hard than they?
The bleating sheep with my complaints agree,
They parch'd with heat, and I inflamed by thee.    
The sultry Sirius burns the thirsty plains,
While in thy heart eternal winter reigns.

RHYME a a *

Where stray ye, Muses, in what lawn or grove,
While your Alexis pines in hopeless love?
In those fair fields where sacred Isis glides,
Or else where Cam his winding vales divides?
As in the crystal spring I view my face,
Fresh rising blushes paint the watery glass;
But since those graces please thy eyes no more,
I shun the fountains which I sought before.        
Once I was skill'd in every herb that grew,
And every plant that drinks the morning dew;
Ah, wretched shepherd, what avails thy art,
To cure thy lambs, but not to heal thy heart!
Let other swains attend the rural care,
Feed fairer flocks, or richer fleeces shear:
But nigh yon mountain let me tune my lays,
Embrace my love, and bind my brows with bays.
That flute is mine which Colin's tuneful breath
Inspired when living, and bequeath'd in death;     
He said, 'Alexis, take this pipe--the same
That taught the groves my Rosalinda's name:'
But now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree,
For ever silent, since despised by thee.
Oh! were I made by some transforming power
The captive bird that sings within thy bower!
Then might my voice thy listening ears employ,
And I those kisses he receives, enjoy.

RHYME a a *

And yet my numbers please the rural throng,
Rough Satyrs dance, and Pan applauds the song:     
The Nymphs, forsaking every cave and spring,
Their early fruit, and milk-white turtles bring;
Each amorous nymph prefers her gifts in vain.
On you their gifts are all bestow'd again.
For you the swains the fairest flowers design,
And in one garland all their beauties join;
Accept the wreath which you deserve alone,
In whom all beauties are comprised in one.

RHYME a a *

See what delights in sylvan scenes appear!
Descending gods have found Elysium here.           
In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray'd,
And chaste Diana haunts the forest shade.
Come, lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours,
When swains from shearing seek their nightly bowers,
When weary reapers quit the sultry field,
And crown'd with corn their thanks to Ceres yield;
This harmless grove no lurking viper hides,
But in my breast the serpent love abides.
Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew,
But your Alexis knows no sweets but you.           
Oh, deign to visit our forsaken seats,
The mossy fountains, and the green retreats!
Where'er you walk, cool gales shall fan the glade,
Trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade:
Where'er you tread, the blushing flowers shall rise,
And all things flourish where you turn your eyes.
Oh, how I long with you to pass my days,
Invoke the Muses, and resound your praise!
Your praise the birds shall chant in every grove,
And winds shall waft it to the Powers above.       
But would you sing, and rival Orpheus' strain,
The wondering forests soon should dance again,
The moving mountains hear the powerful call,
And headlong streams hang listening in their fall!

RHYME a a *

But see, the shepherds shun the noonday heat,
The lowing herds to murmuring brooks retreat,
To closer shades the panting flocks remove;
Ye gods! and is there no relief for love?
But soon the sun with milder rays descends
To the cool ocean, where his journey ends:         
On me Love's fiercer flames for ever prey,
By night he scorches, as he burns by day.

RHYME a a *

Beneath the shade a spreading beech displays,
Hylas and AEgon sung their rural lays;
This mourn'd a faithless, that an absent love.
And Delia's name and Doris' fill'd the grove.
Ye Mantuan nymphs, your sacred succour bring;
Hylas and AEgon's rural lays I sing.

RHYME a a *

Thou, whom the Nine with Plautus' wit inspire,
The art of Terence, and Menander's fire;
Whose sense instructs us, and whose humour charms,
Whose judgment sways us, and whose spirit warms!   
Oh, skill'd in Nature! see the hearts of swains,
Their artless passions, and their tender pains.

RHYME a a *

Now setting Phoebus shone serenely bright,
And fleecy clouds were streak'd with purple light;
When tuneful Hylas, with melodious moan,
Taught rocks to weep, and made the mountains groan.

Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs away!
To Delia's ear the tender notes convey.
As some sad turtle his lost love deplores,
And with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores,   
Thus, far from Delia, to the winds I mourn,
Alike unheard, unpitied, and forlorn.

RHYME a a *

Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs along!
For her, the feather'd choirs neglect their song:
For her, the limes their pleasing shades deny;
For her, the lilies hang their heads and die.
Ye flowers that droop, forsaken by the spring,
Ye birds that, left by summer, cease to sing,
Ye trees that fade when autumn-heats remove,
Say, is not absence death to those who love?       

RHYME a a *

Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs away!
Cursed be the fields that cause my Delia's stay;
Fade every blossom, wither every tree,
Die every flower, and perish all but she.

RHYME a a *

What have I said? Where'er my Delia flies,
Let spring attend, and sudden flowers arise;
Let opening roses knotted oaks adorn,
And liquid amber drop from every thorn.

RHYME a a *

Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs along!
The birds shall cease to tune their evening song,  
The winds to breathe, the waving woods to move,
And streams to murmur, ere I cease to love.
Not bubbling fountains to the thirsty swain,
Not balmy sleep to labourers faint with pain,
Not showers to larks, or sunshine to the bee,
Are half so charming as thy sight to me.
Go, gentle gales, and bear my sighs away!
Come, Delia, come; ah, why this long delay?
Through rocks and caves the name of Delia sounds,
Delia, each care and echoing rock rebounds.        
Ye Powers, what pleasing frenzy soothes my mind!
Do lovers dream, or is my Delia kind?
She comes, my Delia comes!--Now cease, my lay,
And cease, ye gales, to bear my sighs away!

Next AEgon sung, while Windsor groves admired;
Rehearse, ye Muses, what yourselves inspired.

RHYME a a *

Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful strain!
Of perjured Doris, dying I complain:
Here where the mountains, lessening as they rise,
Lose the low vales, and steal into the skies:      
While labouring oxen, spent with toil and heat,
In their loose traces from the field retreat:
While curling smokes from village-tops are seen,
And the fleet shades glide o'er the dusky green.

RHYME a a *

Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful lay!
Beneath yon poplar oft we pass'd the day:
Oft on the rind I carved her amorous vows,
While she with garlands hung the bending boughs:
The garlands fade, the vows are worn away;
So dies her love, and so my hopes decay.           

RHYME a a *

Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful strain!
Now bright Arcturus glads the teeming grain,
Now golden fruits on loaded branches shine,
And grateful clusters swell with floods of wine;
Now blushing berries paint the yellow grove;
Just gods! shall all things yield returns but love?

RHYME a a *

Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful lay!
The shepherds cry, 'Thy flocks are left a prey'--
Ah! what avails it me, the flocks to keep,
Who lost my heart--while I preserved my sheep.     
Pan came, and ask'd, what magic caused my smart,
Or what ill eyes malignant glances dart?
What eyes but hers, alas, have power to move?
And is there magic but what dwells in love?

RHYME a a *

Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful strains!
I'll fly from shepherds, flocks, and flowery plains.
From shepherds, flocks, and plains, I may remove,
Forsake mankind, and all the world--but Love!
I know thee, Love! on foreign mountains bred,
Wolves gave thee suck, and savage tigers fed.      
Thou wert from Etna's burning entrails torn,
Got by fierce whirlwinds, and in thunder born!

RHYME a a *

Resound, ye hills, resound my mournful lay!
Farewell, ye woods; adieu, the light of day!
One leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains;
No more, ye hills, no more resound my strains!

Thus sung the shepherds till the approach of night,
The skies yet blushing with departing light,
When falling dews with spangles deck'd the glade,
And the low sun had lengthen'd every shade.

Thyrsis, the music of that murmuring spring
Is not so mournful as the strains you sing;
Nor rivers winding through the vales below,
So sweetly warble, or so smoothly flow.
Now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces lie,
The moon, serene in glory, mounts the sky,
While silent birds forget their tuneful lays,
Oh sing of Daphne's fate, and Daphne's praise!

RHYME a a *

Behold the groves that shine with silver frost,
Their beauty wither'd, and their verdure lost.     
Here shall I try the sweet Alexis' strain,
That call'd the listening Dryads to the plain?
Thames heard the numbers as he flow'd along,
And bade his willows learn the moving song.

So may kind rains their vital moisture yield
And swell the future harvest of the field.
Begin; this charge the dying Daphne gave,

And with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn.

Ye gentle Muses, leave your crystal spring,
Let nymphs and sylvans cypress garlands bring;
Ye weeping Loves, the stream with myrtles hide,
And break your bows, as when Adonis died;
And with your golden darts, now useless grown,
Inscribe a verse on this relenting stone:
'Let Nature change, let Heaven and Earth deplore,
Fair Daphne's dead, and Love is now no more!'
'Tis done, and Nature's various charms decay;
See gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day!        
Now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear,
Their faded honours scatter'd on her bier.
See where, on earth, the flowery glories lie,
With her they flourish'd, and with her they die.
Ah, what avail the beauties Nature wore,
Fair Daphne's dead, and Beauty is no more!

RHYME a a *

For her the flocks refuse their verdant food,
The thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood,
The silver swans her hapless fate bemoan,
In notes more sad than when they sing their own;   
In hollow caves sweet Echo silent lies,
Silent, or only to her name replies;
Her name with pleasure once she taught the shore;
Now Daphne's dead, and Pleasure is no more!

RHYME a a *

No grateful dews descend from evening skies,
Nor morning odours from the flowers arise;
No rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field,
Nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield.
The balmy zephyrs, silent since her death,
Lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath;            
Th' industrious bees neglect their golden store;
Fair Daphne's dead, and Sweetness is no more!

RHYME a a *

No more the mounting larks, while Daphne sings,
Shall, listening in mid air, suspend their wings;
No more the birds shall imitate her lays,
Or, hush'd with wonder, hearken from the sprays:
No more the streams their murmurs shall forbear,
A sweeter music than their own to hear;
But tell the reeds, and tell the vocal shore,
Fair Daphne's dead, and Music is no more!          

RHYME a a *

Her fate is whisper'd by the gentle breeze,
And told in sighs to all the trembling trees;
The trembling trees, in every plain and wood,
Her fate remurmur to the silver flood;
The silver flood, so lately calm, appears
Swell'd with new passion, and o'erflows with tears;
The winds and trees and floods her death deplore,
Daphne, our grief, our glory now no more!

RHYME a a *

But see! where Daphne wondering mounts on high
Above the clouds, above the starry sky!            
Eternal beauties grace the shining scene,
Fields ever fresh, and groves for ever green!
There while you rest in amaranthine bowers,
Or from those meads select unfading flowers,
Behold us kindly, who your name implore,
Daphne, our goddess, and our grief no more!

RHYME a a *

How all things listen, while thy Muse complains!
Such silence waits on Philomela's strains,
In some still evening, when the whispering breeze
Pants on the leaves, and dies upon the trees.      
To thee, bright goddess, oft a lamb shall bleed,
If teeming ewes increase my fleecy breed.
While plants their shade, or flowers their odours give,
Thy name, thy honour, and thy praise shall live!

RHYME a a *

But see, Orion sheds unwholesome dews;
Arise, the pines a noxious shade diffuse;
Sharp Boreas blows, and Nature feels decay,
Time conquers all, and we must Time obey.
Adieu, ye vales, ye mountains, streams, and groves;
Adieu, ye shepherds, rural lays, and loves;        
Adieu, my flocks; farewell, ye sylvan crew;
Daphne, farewell; and all the world, adieu!

Ye Nymphs of Solyma! begin the song:
To heavenly themes sublimer strains belong.
The mossy fountains, and the sylvan shades,
The dreams of Pindus and the Aonian maids,
Delight no more--O Thou my voice inspire
Who touch'd Isaiah's hallow'd lips with fire!

RHYME a a *

Rapt into future times, the bard begun:
A virgin shall conceive, a virgin bear a son!
From Jesse's root behold the branch arise,
Whose sacred flower with fragrance fills the skies:
The ethereal Spirit o'er its leaves shall move,
And on its top descends the mystic Dove.
Ye Heavens! from high the dewy nectar pour,
And in soft silence shed the kindly shower!
The sick and weak the healing plant shall aid,
From storms a shelter, and from heat a shade.
All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail;
Returning Justice lift aloft her scale;
Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,
And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend.     
Swift fly the years, and rise the expected morn!
Oh spring to light, auspicious Babe, be born!
See, Nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring,
With all the incense of the breathing spring!
See lofty Lebanon his head advance,
See nodding forests on the mountains dance:
See spicy clouds from lowly Saron rise,
And Carmel's flowery top perfumes the skies!
Hark! a glad voice the lonely desert cheers;
'Prepare the way! a God, a God appears:'           
'A God, a God!' the vocal hills reply,
The rocks proclaim the approaching Deity.
Lo, Earth receives him from the bending skies!
Sink down, ye mountains, and ye valleys, rise;
With heads declined, ye cedars, homage pay;
Be smooth, ye rocks, ye rapid floods, give way!
The Saviour comes! by ancient bards foretold:
Hear him, ye deaf, and all ye blind, behold!
He from thick films shall purge the visual ray,
And on the sightless eyeball pour the day:         
'Tis he the obstructed paths of sound shall clear,
And bid new music charm th' unfolding ear:
The dumb shall sing, the lame his crutch forego,
And leap exulting like the bounding roe.
No sigh, no murmur the wide world shall hear,
From every face he wipes off every tear.
In adamantine chains shall Death be bound,
And Hell's grim tyrant feel th' eternal wound.
As the good shepherd tends his fleecy care,
Seeks freshest pasture and the purest air,         
Explores the lost, the wandering sheep directs,
By day o'ersees them, and by night protects,
The tender lambs he raises in his arms,
Feeds from his hand, and in his bosom warms;
Thus shall mankind his guardian care engage,
The promised Father of the future age.
No more shall nation against nation rise,
Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes,
Nor fields with gleaming steel be cover'd o'er,
The brazen trumpets kindle rage no more;           
But useless lances into scythes shall bend,
And the broad falchion in a ploughshare end.
Then palaces shall rise; the joyful son
Shall finish what his short-lived sire begun;
Their vines a shadow to their race shall yield,
And the same hand that sow'd, shall reap the field;
The swain in barren deserts with surprise
See lilies spring, and sudden verdure rise;
And start, amidst the thirsty wilds, to hear
New falls of water murmuring in his ear.           
On rifted rocks, the dragons' late abodes,
The green reed trembles, and the bulrush nods,
Waste sandy valleys, once perplex'd with thorn,
The spiry fir, and shapely box adorn:
To leafless shrubs the flowering palms succeed,
And odorous myrtle to the noisome weed.
The lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead,
And boys in flowery bands the tiger lead;
The steer and lion at one crib shall meet,
And harmless serpents lick the pilgrim's feet.     
The smiling infant in his hand shall take
The crested basilisk and speckled snake,
Pleased, the green lustre of the scales survey,
And with their forky tongue shall innocently play.
Rise, crown'd with light, imperial Salem, rise!
Exalt thy towery head, and lift thy eyes!
See, a long race thy spacious courts adorn;
See future sons, and daughters yet unborn,
In crowding ranks on every side arise,
Demanding life, impatient for the skies!           
See barbarous nations at thy gates attend,
Walk in thy light and in thy temple bend;
See thy bright altars throng'd with prostrate kings,
And heap'd with products of Sabean springs!
For thee Idume's spicy forests blow,
And seeds of gold in Ophir's mountains glow.
See Heaven its sparkling portals wide display,
And break upon thee in a flood of day!
No more the rising sun shall gild the morn,
Nor evening Cynthia fill her silver horn;      
But lost, dissolved in thy superior rays,
One tide of glory, one unclouded blaze
O'erflow thy courts: The Light himself shall shine
Reveal'd, and God's eternal day be thine!
The seas shall waste, the skies in smoke decay,
Rocks fall to dust, and mountains melt away;
But fix'd his word, his saving power remains;
Thy realm for ever lasts, thy own MESSIAH reigns!

Thy forests, Windsor! and thy green retreats,
At once the Monarch's and the Muse's seats,
Invite my lays. Be present, sylvan Maids!
Unlock your springs, and open all your shades.
Granville commands; your aid, O Muses, bring!
What Muse for Granville can refuse to sing?

The groves of Eden, vanish'd now so long,
Live in description, and look green in song:
These, were my breast inspired with equal flame,
Like them in beauty, should be like in fame.       
Here hills and vales, the woodland and the plain,
Here earth and water seem to strive again;
Not chaos-like, together crush'd and bruised,
But, as the world, harmoniously confused;
Where order in variety we see,
And where, though all things differ, all agree.
Here waving groves a chequer'd scene display,
And part admit, and part exclude the day;
As some coy nymph her lover's warm address
Nor quite indulges, nor can quite repress.         
There, interspersed in lawns and opening glades,
Thin trees arise that shun each other's shades.
Here in full light the russet plains extend:
There, wrapt in clouds the bluish hills ascend.
Ev'n the wild heath displays her purple dyes,
And 'midst the desert fruitful fields arise,
That crown'd with tufted trees and springing corn,
Like verdant isles the sable waste adorn.
Let India boast her plants, nor envy we
The weeping amber or the balmy tree,               
While by our oaks the precious loads are born,
And realms commanded which those trees adorn.
Not proud Olympus yields a nobler sight,
Though gods assembled grace his towering height.
Than what more humble mountains offer here,
Where, in their blessings, all those gods appear.
See Pan with flocks, with fruits Pomona crown'd,
Here blushing Flora paints the enamell'd ground,
Here Ceres' gifts in waving prospect stand,
And nodding tempt the joyful reaper's hand;        
Rich industry sits smiling on the plains,
And peace and plenty tell a Stuart reigns.

RHYME a a *

Not thus the land appear'd in ages past,
A dreary desert, and a gloomy waste,
To savage beasts and savage laws0] a prey,
And kings more furious and severe than they;
Who claim'd the skies, dispeopled air and floods,
The lonely lords of empty wilds and woods:
Cities laid waste, they storm'd the dens and caves,
(For wiser brutes were backward to be slaves).     
What could be free, when lawless beasts obey'd,
And even the elements a tyrant sway'd?
In vain kind seasons swell'd the teeming grain,
Soft showers distill'd, and suns grew warm in vain;
The swain with tears his frustrate labour yields,
And famish'd dies amidst his ripen'd fields.
What wonder, then, a beast or subject slain
Were equal crimes in a despotic reign?
Both doom'd alike, for sportive tyrants bled,
But while the subject starved, the beast was fed.  
Proud Nimrod first the bloody chase began,
A mighty hunter, and his prey was man:
Our haughty Norman boasts that barbarous name,
And makes his trembling slaves the royal game.
The fields are ravish'd from the industrious swains,
From men their cities, and from gods their fanes:
The levell'd towns with weeds lie cover'd o'er;
The hollow winds through naked temples roar;
Round broken columns clasping ivy twined;
O'er heaps of ruin stalk'd the stately hind;       
The fox obscene to gaping tombs retires,
And savage howlings fill the sacred choirs.
Awed by his Nobles, by his Commons cursed,
The oppressor ruled tyrannic where he durst,
Stretch'd o'er the poor and Church his iron rod,
And served alike his vassals and his God.
Whom even the Saxon spared, and bloody Dane,
The wanton victims of his sport remain.
But see, the man who spacious regions gave
A waste for beasts, himself denied a grave!     
Stretch'd on the lawn, his second hope survey,
At once the chaser, and at once the prey:
Lo Rufus, tugging at the deadly dart,
Bleeds in the forest like a wounded hart.
Succeeding monarchs heard the subjects' cries,
Nor saw displeased the peaceful cottage rise.
Then gathering flocks on unknown mountains fed,
O'er sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread,
The forests wonder'd at the unusual grain,
And secret transport touch'd the conscious swain.  
Fair Liberty, Britannia's goddess, rears
Her cheerful head, and leads the golden years.

RHYME a a *

Ye vigorous swains! while youth ferments your blood,
And purer spirits swell the sprightly flood,
Now range the hills, the gameful woods beset,
Wind the shrill horn, or spread the waving net.
When milder autumn summer's heat succeeds,
And in the new-shorn field the partridge feeds,
Before his lord the ready spaniel bounds,
Panting with hope, he tries the furrow'd grounds;
But when the tainted gales the game betray,
Couch'd close he lies, and meditates the prey:
Secure they trust the unfaithful field beset,
Till hovering o'er 'em sweeps the swelling net.
Thus (if small things we may with great compare)
When Albion sends her eager sons to war,
Some thoughtless town, with ease and plenty blest,
Near, and more near, the closing lines invest;
Sudden they seize the amazed, defenceless prize,
And high in air Britannia's standard flies.    

RHYME a a *

See! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs,
And mounts exulting on triumphant wings:
Short is his joy; he feels the fiery wound,
Flutters in blood, and panting beats the ground.
Ah! what avail his glossy, varying dyes,
His purple crest, and scarlet-circled eyes,
The vivid green his shining plumes unfold,
His painted wings, and breast that flames with gold?

RHYME a a *

Nor yet, when moist Arcturus clouds the sky,
The woods and fields their pleasing toils deny.
To plains with well-breath'd beagles we repair,
And trace the mazes of the circling hare;
(Beasts, urged by us, their fellow-beasts pursue,
And learn of man each other to undo.)
With slaughtering gun the unwearied fowler roves,
When frosts have whiten'd all the naked groves;
Where doves in flocks the leafless trees o'ershade,
And lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade.
He lifts the tube, and levels with his eye;
Straight a short thunder breaks the frozen sky;
Oft, as in airy rings they skim the heath,
The clamorous lapwings feel the leaden death:
Oft, as the mounting larks their notes prepare,
They fall, and leave their little lives in air.

RHYME a a *

In genial spring, beneath the quivering shade,
Where cooling vapours breathe along the mead,
The patient fisher takes his silent stand,
Intent, his angle trembling in his hand:
With looks unmoved, he hopes the scaly breed,
And eyes the dancing cork, and bending reed.   
Our plenteous streams a various race supply,
The bright-eyed perch with fins of Tyrian dye,
The silver eel, in shining volumes roll'd,
The yellow carp, in scales bedropp'd with gold,
Swift trouts, diversified with crimson stains,
And pikes, the tyrants of the watery plains.

RHYME a a *

Now Cancer glows with Phoebus' fiery car:
The youth rush eager to the sylvan war,
Swarm o'er the lawns, the forest walks surround,
Rouse the fleet hart, and cheer the opening hound.
The impatient courser pants in every vein,
And pawing, seems to beat the distant plain:
Hills, vales, and floods appear already cross'd,
And ere he starts, a thousand steps are lost.
See the bold youth strain up the threatening steep,
Rush through the thickets, down the valleys sweep,
Hang o'er their coursers' heads with eager speed,
And earth rolls back beneath the flying steed.
Let old Arcadia boast her ample plain,
The immortal huntress, and her virgin-train;   
Nor envy, Windsor! since thy shades have seen
As bright a goddess, and as chaste a queen,
Whose care, like hers, protects the sylvan reign,
The earth's fair light, and empress of the main.

RHYME a a *

Here too, 'tis sung, of old Diana stray'd,
And Cynthus' top forsook for Windsor shade;
Here was she seen o'er airy wastes to rove,
Seek the clear spring, or haunt the pathless grove;
Here, arm'd with silver bows, in early dawn,
Her buskin'd virgins traced the dewy lawn.     

RHYME a a *

Above the rest a rural nymph was famed,
Thy offspring, Thames! the fair Lodona named;
(Lodona's fate, in long oblivion cast,
The Muse shall sing, and what she sings shall last).
Scarce could the goddess from her nymph be known,
But by the crescent and the golden zone.
She scorn'd the praise of beauty, and the care;
A belt her waist, a fillet binds her hair;
A painted quiver on her shoulder sounds,
And with her dart the flying deer she wounds.
It chanced, as eager of the chase, the maid
Beyond the forest's verdant limits stray'd,    
Pan saw and loved, and, burning with desire,
Pursued her flight, her flight increased his fire.
Not half so swift the trembling doves can fly,
When the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky;
Not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves,
When through the clouds he drives the trembling doves;
As from the god she flew with furious pace,
Or as the god, more furious, urged the chase.
Now fainting, sinking, pale the nymph appears;
Now close behind, his sounding steps she hears;
And now his shadow reach'd her as she run,
His shadow lengthen'd by the setting sun;
And now his shorter breath, with sultry air,
Pants on her neck, and fans her parting hair.
In vain on father Thames she calls for aid,
Nor could Diana help her injured maid.
Faint, breathless, thus she pray'd, nor pray'd in vain:
'Ah, Cynthia! ah--though banish'd from thy train,
Let me, oh! let me, to the shades repair,
My native shades--there weep, and murmur there.' 
She said, and melting as in tears she lay,
In a soft, silver stream dissolved away.
The silver stream her virgin coldness keeps,
For ever murmurs, and for ever weeps;
Still bears the name the hapless virgin bore,
And bathes the forest where she ranged before.
In her chaste current oft the goddess laves,
And with celestial tears augments the waves.
Oft in her glass the musing shepherd spies
The headlong mountains and the downward skies, 
The watery landscape of the pendent woods,
And absent trees that tremble in the floods;
In the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen,
And floating forests paint the waves with green,
Through the fair scene roll slow the lingering streams,
Then foaming pour along, and rush into the Thames.

RHYME a a *

Thou, too, great Father of the British floods!
With joyful pride survey'st our lofty woods;
Where towering oaks their growing honours rear,
And future navies on thy shores appear.        
Not Neptune's self from all her streams receives
A wealthier tribute, than to thine he gives.
No seas so rich, so gay no banks appear,
No lake so gentle, and no spring so clear.
Nor Po so swells the fabling poet's lays,
While led along the skies his current strays,
As thine, which visits Windsor's famed abodes,
To grace the mansion of our earthly gods:
Nor all his stars above a lustre show,
Like the bright beauties on thy banks below;   
Where Jove, subdued by mortal passion still,
Might change Olympus for a nobler hill.

RHYME a a *

Happy the man whom this bright court approves,
His sovereign favours, and his country loves:
Happy next him who to these shades retires,
Whom Nature charms, and whom the Muse inspires:
Whom humbler joys of home-felt quiet please,
Successive study, exercise, and ease.
He gathers health from herbs the forest yields,
And of their fragrant physic spoils the fields:
With chemic art exalts the mineral powers,
And draws the aromatic souls of flowers:
Now marks the course of rolling orbs on high;
O'er figured worlds now travels with his eye;
Of ancient writ unlocks the learned store,
Consults the dead, and lives past ages o'er:
Or wandering thoughtful in the silent wood,
Attends the duties of the wise and good,
To observe a mean, be to himself a friend,
To follow nature, and regard his end;          
Or looks on Heaven with more than mortal eyes,
Bids his free soul expatiate in the skies,
Amid her kindred stars familiar roam,
Survey the region, and confess her home!
Such was the life great Scipio once admired,
Thus Atticus, and Trumbull thus retired.

RHYME a a *

Ye sacred Nine! that all my soul possess,
Whose raptures fire me, and whose visions bless,
Bear me, oh, bear me to sequester'd scenes,
The bowery mazes, and surrounding greens:      
To Thames's banks which fragrant breezes fill,
Or where ye Muses sport on Cooper's Hill.
(On Cooper's Hill eternal wreaths shall grow,
While lasts the mountain, or while Thames shall flow.)
I seem through consecrated walks to rove,
I hear soft music die along the grove:
Led by the sound, I roam from shade to shade,
By godlike poets venerable made:
Here his first lays majestic Denham sung;
There the last numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue.
Oh early lost! what tears the river shed,
When the sad pomp along his banks was led!
His drooping swans on every note expire,
And on his willows hung each Muse's lyre.

RHYME a a *

Since fate relentless stopp'd their heavenly voice,
No more the forests ring, or groves rejoice;
Who now shall charm the shades, where Cowley strung
His living harp, and lofty Denham sung?
But hark! the groves rejoice, the forest rings!
Are these revived? or is it Granville sings?   
'Tis yours, my lord, to bless our soft retreats,
And call the Muses to their ancient seats;
To paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes,
To crown the forest with immortal greens,
Make Windsor hills in lofty numbers rise,
And lift her turrets nearer to the skies;
To sing those honours you deserve to wear,
And add new lustre to her silver star.

Here noble Surrey felt the sacred rage,
Surrey, the Granville of a former age:         
Matchless his pen, victorious was his lance,
Bold in the lists, and graceful in the dance:
In the same shades the Cupids tuned his lyre,
To the same notes, of love and soft desire:
Fair Geraldine, bright object of his vow,
Then fill'd the groves, as heavenly Mira now.

RHYME a a *

Oh, wouldst thou sing what heroes Windsor bore,
What kings first breathed upon her winding shore,
Or raise old warriors, whose adored remains
In weeping vaults her hallow'd earth contains! 
With Edward's acts adorn the shining page,
Stretch his long triumphs down through every age,
Draw monarchs chain'd, and Cressy's glorious field,
The lilies blazing on the regal shield:
Then, from her roofs when Verrio's colours fall,
And leave inanimate the naked wall,
Still in thy song should vanquish'd France appear,
And bleed for ever under Britain's spear.

Let softer strains ill-fated Henry mourn,
And palms eternal flourish round his urn.      
Here o'er the martyr-king the marble weeps,
And, fast beside him, once-fear'd Edward sleeps.

From old Belerium to the northern main,
The grave unites; where ev'n the great find rest,
And blended lie the oppressor and the oppress'd!

Make sacred Charles' tomb for ever known,
(Obscure the place, and uninscribed the stone)
Oh fact accursed! what tears has Albion shed,
Heavens, what new wounds! and how her old have bled!
She saw her sons with purple deaths expire,
Her sacred domes involved in rolling fire,
A dreadful series of intestine wars,
Inglorious triumphs and dishonest scars.
At length great Anna said--'Let discord cease!'
She said, the world obey'd, and all was peace!

In that blest moment, from his oozy bed
Old Father Thames advanced his reverend head;
His tresses dropp'd with dews, and o'er the stream
His shining horns diffused a golden gleam:     
Graved on his urn appear'd the moon, that guides
His swelling waters, and alternate tides;
The figured streams in waves of silver roll'd,
And on their banks Augusta rose in gold.
Around his throne the sea-born brothers stood,
Who swell with tributary urns his flood;
First the famed authors of his ancient name,
The winding Isis and the fruitful Thame:
The Kennet swift, for silver eels renown'd;
The Loddon slow, with verdant alders crown'd;  
Cole, whose dark streams his flowery islands lave;
And chalky Wey, that rolls a milky wave;
The blue, transparent Vandalis appears;
The gulfy Lee his sedgy tresses rears;
And sullen Mole, that hides his diving flood;
And silent Darent, stain'd with Danish blood.

High in the midst, upon his urn reclined,
(His sea-green mantle waving with the wind)
The god appear'd: he turn'd his azure eyes
Where Windsor-domes and pompous turrets rise;  
Then bow'd and spoke; the winds forget to roar,
And the hush'd waves glide softly to the shore.

Hail, sacred Peace! hail, long-expected days,
That Thames's glory to the stars shall raise!
Though Tiber's streams immortal Rome behold,
Though foaming Hermus swells with tides of gold,
From heaven itself though sevenfold Nilus flows,
And harvests on a hundred realms bestows;
These now no more shall be the Muse's themes,
Lost in my fame, as in the sea their streams.  
Let Volga's banks with iron squadrons shine,
And groves of lances glitter on the Rhine,
Let barbarous Ganges arm a servile train;
Be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign.
No more my sons shall dye with British blood
Red Iber's sands, or Ister's foaming flood:
Safe on my shore each unmolested swain
Shall tend the flocks, or reap the bearded grain;
The shady empire shall retain no trace
Of war or blood, but in the sylvan chase;      
The trumpet sleep, while cheerful horns are blown,
And arms employ'd on birds and beasts alone.
Behold! the ascending villas on my side,
Project long shadows o'er the crystal tide,
Behold! Augusta's glittering spires increase,
And temples rise, the beauteous works of Peace.
I see, I see, where two fair cities bend
Their ample bow, a new Whitehall ascend!
There mighty nations shall inquire their doom,
The world's great oracle in times to come;     
There kings shall sue, and suppliant states be seen
Once more to bend before a British queen.

RHYME a a *

Thy trees, fair Windsor! now shall leave their woods,
And half thy forests rush into the floods,
Bear Britain's thunder, and her cross display,
To the bright regions of the rising day;
Tempt icy seas, where scarce the waters roll,
Where clearer flames glow round the frozen pole;
Or under southern skies exalt their sails,
Led by new stars, and borne by spicy gales!    
For me the balm shall bleed, and amber flow,
The coral redden, and the ruby glow,
The pearly shell its lucid globe infold,
And Phoebus warm the ripening ore to gold.
The time shall come when, free as seas or wind,
Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind,
Whole nations enter with each swelling tide,
And seas but join the regions they divide;
Earth's distant ends our glory shall behold,
And the new world launch forth to seek the old.
Then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tide,
And feather'd people crowd my wealthy side,
And naked youths and painted chiefs admire
Our speech, our colour, and our strange attire!
O stretch thy reign, fair Peace! from shore to shore,
Till conquest cease, and slavery be no more;
Till the freed Indians in their native groves
Reap their own fruits, and woo their sable loves,
Peru once more a race of kings behold,
And other Mexicos be roof'd with gold.         
Exiled by thee from earth to deepest hell,
In brazen bonds, shall barbarous Discord dwell;
Gigantic Pride, pale Terror, gloomy Care,
And mad Ambition shall attend her there:
There purple Vengeance bathed in gore retires,
Her weapons blunted, and extinct her fires:
There hateful Envy her own snakes shall feel,
And Persecution mourn her broken wheel:
There Faction roar, Rebellion bite her chain,
And gasping Furies thirst for blood in vain.   

RHYME a a *

Here cease thy flight, nor with unhallow'd lays
Touch the fair fame of Albion's golden days:
The thoughts of gods let Granville's verse recite,
And bring the scenes of opening fate to light.
My humble Muse, in unambitious strains,
Paints the green forests and the flowery plains,
Where Peace descending bids her olives spring,
And scatters blessings from her dove-like wing.
Ev'n I more sweetly pass my careless days,
Pleased in the silent shade with empty praise; 
Enough for me, that to the listening swains
First in these fields I sung the sylvan strains.

TITLE Ode on St Cecilia's Day

RHYME a b a b

1 Descend, ye Nine! descend and sing;
    The breathing instruments inspire,
  Wake into voice each silent string,
    And sweep the sounding lyre;

RHYME a a b b b c c d d e e f f g h h g

    In a sadly-pleasing strain
    Let the warbling lute complain:
      Let the loud trumpet sound,
      Till the roofs all around
      The shrill echoes rebound:
  While in more lengthen'd notes and slow,
  The deep, majestic, solemn organs blow.
      Hark! the numbers soft and clear,
      Gently steal upon the ear;
      Now louder, and yet louder rise,
      And fill with spreading sounds the skies;
  Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes,
  In broken air, trembling, the wild music floats;
      Till, by degrees, remote and small,
        The strains decay,
        And melt away,
      In a dying, dying fall.

RHYME a a *

2 By Music, minds an equal temper know,
  Nor swell too high, nor sink too low.
  If in the breast tumultuous joys arise,
  Music her soft, assuasive voice applies;
    Or, when the soul is press'd with cares,
    Exalts her in enlivening airs.
  Warriors she fires with animated sounds;
  Pours balm into the bleeding lover's wounds;
      Melancholy lifts her head,
      Morpheus rouses from his bed,
      Sloth unfolds her arms and wakes,
      Listening Envy drops her snakes;
  Intestine war no more our passions wage,
  And giddy factions hear away their rage.

RHYME a a *

3 But when our country's cause provokes to arms,
  How martial music every bosom warms!

RHYME a b a b c c d e e c d

  So when the first bold vessel dared the seas,
  High on the stern the Thracian raised his strain,
      While Argo saw her kindred trees
      Descend from Pelion to the main.
      Transported demigods stood round,
    And men grew heroes at the sound,
    Inflamed with glory's charms:
  Each chief his sevenfold shield display'd,
  And half unsheath'd the shining blade:
  And seas, and rocks, and skies rebound,
  'To arms, to arms, to arms!'

RHYME a a *

4 But when through all the infernal bounds,
  Which flaming Phlegethon surrounds,
      Love, strong as death, the poet led
      To the pale nations of the dead,
  What sounds were heard,
  What scenes appear'd,

RHYME a b b c c d d a

    O'er all the dreary coasts!
        Dreadful gleams,
        Dismal screams,
 Fires that glow,
        Shrieks of woe,
        Sullen moans,
        Hollow groans,
      And cries of tortured ghosts!
 
RHYME a a b c c b d d

 But, hark! he strikes the golden lyre;
  And see! the tortured ghosts respire,
          See, shady forms advance!
    Thy stone, O Sisyphus! stands still,
    Ixion rests upon his wheel.
          And the pale spectres dance!
  The Furies sink upon their iron beds,
  And snakes uncurl'd hang listening round their heads.

RHYME a a b c c b d d e e f f

5    'By the streams that ever flow,
      By the fragrant winds that blow
        O'er the Elysian flowers;
      By those happy souls who dwell
      In yellow meads of asphodel,
        Or amaranthine bowers;
      By the hero's armed shades,
      Glittering through the gloomy glades;
      By the youths that died for love,
      Wandering in the myrtle grove,
  Restore, restore Eurydice to life:
  Oh take the husband, or return the wife!'

RHYME a b a b c c d e e d
   
   He sung, and hell consented
        To hear the poet's prayer:
      Stern Proserpine relented,
        And gave him back the fair.
          Thus song could prevail
          O'er death and o'er hell,
  A conquest how hard and how glorious!
      Though fate had fast bound her
      With Styx nine times round her,
  Yet Music and Love were victorious.

RHYME a a *

6 But soon, too soon, the lover turns his eyes:
  Again she falls, again she dies, she dies!
  How wilt thou now the fatal sisters move?
  No crime was thine, if 'tis no crime to love.
    Now under hanging mountains,
    Beside the falls of fountains,
    Or where Hebrus wanders,
    Rolling in meanders,

RHYME a a a       

 All alone,
        Unheard, unknown,
        He makes his moan;

RHYME a a *

        And calls her ghost,
      For ever, ever, ever lost!
      Now with Furies surrounded,
      Despairing, confounded,
      He trembles, he glows,
      Amidst Rhodope's snows:
    
RHYME a a a

See, wild as the winds, o'er the desert he flies;
    Hark! Haemus resounds with the bacchanals' cries--
                       Ah see, he dies!

RHYME a a b b a  

  Yet even in death Eurydice he sung,
    Eurydice still trembled on his tongue,
          Eurydice the woods,
          Eurydice the floods,
  Eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung.

RHYME a a *

7     Music the fiercest grief can charm,
      And Fate's severest rage disarm:
      Music can soften pain to ease,
      And make despair and madness please:
      Our joys below it can improve,
      And antedate the bliss above.
    This the divine Cecilia found,
  And to her Maker's praise confined the sound.

RHYME a b a a b

  When the full organ joins the tuneful choir,
    The immortal powers incline their ear;
  Borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire,
  While solemn airs improve the sacred fire;
    And angels lean from heaven to hear.

RHYME a b a b

  Of Orpheus now no more let poets tell,
  To bright Cecilia greater power is given;
    His numbers raised a shade from hell,
      Hers lift the soul to heaven.

TITLE Chorus of Athenians

RHYME a a *

Ye shades, where sacred truth is sought;
Groves, where immortal sages taught:
    Where heavenly visions Plato fired,
    And Epicurus' lay inspired;
    In vain your guiltless laurels stood
    Unspotted long with human blood.
War, horrid war, your thoughtful walks invades,
And steel now glitters in the Muses' shades.

RHYME a a *

    O heaven-born sisters! source of art!
    Who charm the sense, or mend the heart;
    Who lead fair Virtue's train along,
    Moral truth, and mystic song!
    To what new clime, what distant sky,
    Forsaken, friendless, shall ye fly?
Say, will ye bless the bleak Atlantic shore,
Or bid the furious Gaul be rude no more?

RHYME a a *

    When Athens sinks by fates unjust,
    When wild barbarians spurn her dust;
    Perhaps even Britain's utmost shore
    Shall cease to blush with strangers' gore,
    See Arts her savage sons control,
    And Athens rising near the pole!
Till some new tyrant lifts his purple hand,
And civil madness tears them from the land.

RHYME a a *

    Ye gods! what justice rules the ball?
    Freedom and Arts together fall;
    Fools grant whate'er Ambition craves,
    And men, once ignorant, are slaves.
    Oh, cursed effects of civil hate,
    In every age, in every state!
Still, when the lust of tyrant power succeeds,
Some Athens perishes, some Tully bleeds.

TITLE

RHYME a a *

O tyrant Love! hast thou possess'd
The prudent, learn'd, and virtuous breast?
Wisdom and wit in vain reclaim,
And arts but soften us to feel thy flame.
  Love, soft intruder, enters here,
  But entering learns to be sincere.
  Marcus with blushes owns he loves,
  And Brutus tenderly reproves.

RHYME a b a b

    Why, Virtue, dost thou blame desire,
      Which Nature has impress'd
    Why, Nature, dost thou soonest fire
      The mild and generous breast?

RHYME a a *

  Love's purer flames the gods approve;
  The gods and Brutus bend to love:
  Brutus for absent Portia sighs,
And sterner Cassius melts at Junia's eyes.
What is loose love? a transient gust,
Spent in a sudden storm of lust,
A vapour fed from wild desire,
A wandering, self-consuming fire.

 RHYME a b a b

  But Hymen's kinder flames unite,
    And burn for ever one;
  Chaste as cold Cynthia's virgin light,
    Productive as the sun.

RHYME a a *

  Oh source of every social tie,
  United wish, and mutual joy!
  What various joys on one attend,
As son, as father, brother, husband, friend!
  Whether his hoary sire he spies,
  While thousand grateful thoughts arise;
  Or meets his spouse's fonder eye;
  Or views his smiling progeny;

RHYME a b a b

    What tender passions take their turns,
      What home-felt raptures move?
    His heart now melts, now leaps, now burns,
      With reverence, hope, and love.

RHYME a a a b c c c b

Hence, guilty joys, distastes, surmises,
Hence, false tears, deceits, disguises,
Dangers, doubts, delays, surprises,
  Fires that scorch, yet dare not shine!
Purest love's unwasting treasure,
Constant faith, fair hope, long leisure,
Days of ease, and nights of pleasure;
  Sacred Hymen! these are thine.

RHYME a a *

Begone, ye critics, and restrain your spite,
Codrus writes on, and will for ever write.
The heaviest Muse the swiftest course has gone,
As clocks run fastest when most lead is on;
What though no bees around your cradle flew,
Nor on your lips distill'd the golden dew,
Yet have we oft discover'd in their stead
A swarm of drones that buzz'd about your head.
When you, like Orpheus, strike the warbling lyre,
Attentive blocks stand round you and admire.
Wit pass'd through thee no longer is the same,
As meat digested takes a different name,
But sense must sure thy safest plunder be,
Since no reprisals can be made on thee.
Thus thou may'st rise, and in thy daring flight
(Though ne'er so weighty) reach a wondrous height.
So, forced from engines, lead itself can fly,
And ponderous slugs move nimbly through the sky.
Sure Bavius copied Maevius to the full,
And Chaerilus taught Codrus to be dull;
Therefore, dear friend, at my advice give o'er
This needless labour; and contend no more
To prove a _dull succession_ to be true,
Since 'tis enough we find it so in you.

1   Vital spark of heavenly flame!
    Quit, oh quit this mortal frame:
    Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying,
    Oh the pain, the bliss of dying!
  Cease, fond Nature, cease thy strife,
  And let me languish into life!

RHYME a a *

2   Hark! they whisper; angels say,
    'Sister Spirit, come away!'
    What is this absorbs me quite?
    Steals my senses, shuts my sight,
  Drowns my spirits, draws my breath?
  Tell me, my soul, can this be Death?

RHYME a a b c c b

3   The world recedes; it disappears!
    Heaven opens on my eyes! my ears
    With sounds seraphic ring!
    Lend, lend your wings! I mount! I fly!
  O Grave! where is thy victory?
  O Death! where is thy sting?

RHYME a a *

What beckoning ghost, along the moonlight shade
Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade?
'Tis she!--but why that bleeding bosom gored,
Why dimly gleams the visionary sword?
Oh, ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell,
Is it, in heaven, a crime to love too well?
To bear too tender, or too firm a heart,
To act a lover's or a Roman's part?
Is there no bright reversion in the sky,
For those who greatly think, or bravely die?       

RHYME a a *

Why bade ye else, ye Powers! her soul aspire
Above the vulgar flight of low desire?
Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;
The glorious fault of angels and of gods:
Thence to their images on earth it flows,
And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows.
Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age,
Dull, sullen prisoners in the body's cage:
Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years
Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres;           
Like Eastern kings a lazy state they keep,
And, close confined to their own palace, sleep.

RHYME a a *

From these perhaps (ere Nature bade her die)
Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky.
As into air the purer spirits flow,
And separate from their kindred dregs below;
So flew the soul to its congenial place,
Nor left one virtue to redeem her race.

RHYME a a *

But thou, false guardian of a charge too good,
Thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood!        
See on these ruby lips the trembling breath,
These cheeks, now fading at the blast of death;
Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before,
And those love-darting eyes must roll no more.
Thus, if Eternal Justice rules the ball,
Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall:
On all the line a sudden vengeance waits,
And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates.
There passengers shall stand, and pointing say,
(While the long funerals blacken all the way)      
'Lo, these were they, whose souls the Furies steel'd,
And cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield.'
Thus unlamented pass the proud away,
The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day!
So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow
For others' good, or melt at others' woe.

RHYME a a *

What can atone (O ever-injured Shade!)
Thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid?
No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear
Pleased thy pale ghost, or graced thy mournful bier, 
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
By strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd!
What, though no friends in sable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public show?
What, though no weeping loves thy ashes grace,
Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face?              
What, though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb?
Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dress'd,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast:
There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow,
There the first roses of the year shall blow;
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade
The ground, now sacred by thy relics made.

RHYME a a *

So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name,
What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame.    
How loved, how honour'd once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dust alone remains of thee,
'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be!

RHYME a a *

Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung,
Deaf the praised ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Even he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays,
Shall shortly want the generous tear he pays;
Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part,
And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart;  
Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er,
The Muse forgot, and thou beloved no more!

RHYME a a *

To wake the soul by tender strokes of art,
To raise the genius, and to mend the heart;
To make mankind, in conscious virtue bold,
Live o'er each scene, and be what they behold:
For this the tragic Muse first trod the stage,
Commanding tears to stream through every age;
Tyrants no more their savage nature kept,
And foes to virtue wonder'd how they wept.
Our author shuns by vulgar springs to move
The hero's glory, or the virgin's love;            
In pitying love, we but our weakness show,
And wild ambition well deserves its woe.
Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause,
Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws:
He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise,
And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes.

RHYME a a *

Virtue confess'd in human shape he draws,
What Plato thought, and godlike Cato was:
No common object to your sight displays,
But what with pleasure Heaven itself surveys,   
A brave man struggling in the storms of fate,
And greatly falling with a falling state.
While Cato gives his little senate laws,
What bosom beats not in his country's cause?
Who sees him act, but envies every deed?
Who hears him groan, and does not wish to bleed?

RHYME a a *

Even when proud Caesar, 'midst triumphal cars,
The spoils of nations, and the pomp of wars,
Ignobly vain and impotently great,
Show'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state;      
As her dead father's reverend image pass'd,
The pomp was darken'd and the day o'ercast;
The triumph ceased, tears gush'd from every eye;
The world's great victor pass'd unheeded by;
Her last good man dejected Rome adored,
And honour'd Caesar's less than Cato's sword.

RHYME a a *

Britons, attend: be worth like this approved,
And show you have the virtue to be moved.
With honest scorn the first famed Cato view'd
Rome learning arts from Greece, whom she subdued;  
Your scene precariously subsists too long
On French translation, and Italian song.
Dare to have sense yourselves; assert the stage,
Be justly warm'd with your own native rage;
Such plays alone should win a British ear,
As Cato's self had not disdain'd to hear.

In that soft season, when descending showers
Call forth the greens, and wake the rising flowers;
When opening buds salute the welcome day,
And earth relenting feels the genial ray;
As balmy sleep had charm'd my cares to rest,
And love itself was banish'd from my breast,
(What time the morn mysterious visions brings,
While purer slumbers spread their golden wings),
A train of phantoms in wild order rose,
And, join'd, this intellectual scene compose.      

RHYME a a *

I stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies;
The whole creation open to my eyes:
In air self-balanced hung the globe below,
Where mountains rise and circling oceans flow;
Here naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen,
There towery cities, and the forests green:
Here sailing ships delight the wandering eyes:
There trees, and intermingled temples rise;
Now a clear sun the shining scene displays,
The transient landscape now in clouds decays.      

RHYME a a *

O'er the wide prospect, as I gazed around,
Sudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound,
Like broken thunders that at distance roar,
Or billows murmuring on the hollow shore:
Then gazing up, a glorious pile beheld,
Whose towering summit ambient clouds conceal'd.
High on a rock of ice the structure lay,
Steep its ascent, and slippery was the way;
The wondrous rock like Parian marble shone,
And seem'd, to distant sight, of solid stone.      

RHYME a a *

Inscriptions here of various names I view'd,
The greater part by hostile time subdued;
Yet wide was spread their fame in ages past,
And poets once had promised they should last.
Some fresh engraved appear'd of wits renown'd;
I look'd again, nor could their trace be found.
Critics I saw, that other names deface,
And fix their own, with labour, in their place:
Their own, like others, soon their place resign'd,
Or disappear'd, and left the first behind.         
Nor was the work impair'd by storms alone,
But felt the approaches of too warm a sun;

RHYME a a *

For Fame, impatient of extremes, decays
Not more by envy than excess of praise.
Yet part no injuries of heaven could feel,
Like crystal faithful to the graving steel:
The rock's high summit, in the temple's shade,
Nor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade.
Their names inscribed unnumber'd ages past
From time's first birth, with time itself shall last;
These ever new, nor subject to decays,
Spread, and grow brighter with the length of days.

RHYME a a *

So Zembla's rocks (the beauteous work of frost)
Rise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast;
Pale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away,
And on the impassive ice the lightnings play;
Eternal snows the growing mass supply,
Till the bright mountains prop the incumbent sky:
As Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears,
The gather'd winter of a thousand years.           

RHYME a a *

On this foundation Fame's high temple stands.
Stupendous pile! not rear'd by mortal hands.
Whate'er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld,
Or elder Babylon, its frame excell'd.
Four faces had the dome, and every face
Of various structure, but of equal grace;

RHYME a a *

Four brazen gates, on columns lifted high,
Salute the different quarters of the sky.
Here fabled chiefs in darker ages born,
Or worthies old, whom arms or arts adorn,          
Who cities raised, or tamed a monstrous race,
The walls in venerable order grace;
Heroes in animated marble frown,
And legislators seem to think in stone.

RHYME a a *

Westward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear'd,
On Doric pillars of white marble rear'd,
Crown'd with an architrave of antique mould,
And sculpture rising on the roughen'd gold.
In shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld,
And Perseus dreadful with Minerva's shield:        
There great Alcides stooping with his toil,
Rests on his club, and holds th' Hesperian spoil.
Here Orpheus sings; trees, moving to the sound,
Start from their roots, and form a shade around;

RHYME a a *

Amphion there the loud creating lyre
Strikes, and behold a sudden Thebes aspire!
Cythaeron's echoes answer to his call,
And half the mountain rolls into a wall:
There might you see the lengthening spires ascend,
The domes swell up, the widening arches bend,      
The growing towers, like exhalations rise,
And the huge columns heave into the skies.

RHYME a a *

The eastern front was glorious to behold,
With diamond flaming, and barbaric gold.
There Ninus shone, who spread the Assyrian fame,
And the great founder of the Persian name:
There in long robes the royal Magi stand,
Grave Zoroaster waves the circling wand,
The sage Chaldeans robed in white appear'd,
And Brachmans, deep in desert woods revered.   

RHYME a a *

These stopp'd the moon, and call'd the unbodied shades
To midnight banquets in the glimmering glades;
Made visionary fabrics round them rise,
And airy spectres skim before their eyes;
Of talismans and sigils knew the power,
And careful watch'd the planetary hour.
Superior, and alone, Confucius stood,
Who taught that useful science--to be good.

RHYME a a *

But on the south, a long majestic race
Of Egypt's priests the gilded niches grace,    
Who measured earth, described the starry spheres,
And traced the long records of lunar years.
High on his car Sesostris struck my view,
Whom sceptred slaves in golden harness drew:
His hands a bow and pointed javelin hold;
His giant limbs are arm'd in scales of gold.
Between the statues obelisks were placed,
And the learn'd walls with hieroglyphics graced.

RHYME a a *

Of Gothic structure was the northern side,
O'erwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride. 
There huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown'd,
And Runic characters were graved around.
There sat Zamolxis with erected eyes,
And Odin here in mimic trances dies.
There on rude iron columns, smear'd with blood,
The horrid forms of Seythian heroes stood,

RHYME a a *

Druids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung)
And youths that died to be by poets sung.
These, and a thousand more of doubtful fame,
To whom old fables gave a lasting name,        
In ranks adorn'd the temple's outward face;
The wall, in lustre and effect like glass,
Which o'er each object casting various dyes,
Enlarges some, and others multiplies:
Nor void of emblem was the mystic wall,
For thus romantic Fame increases all.

RHYME a a *

The temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold
Wide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold:
Raised on a thousand pillars, wreathed around
With laurel foliage, and with eagles crown'd:  
Of bright, transparent beryl were the walls,
The friezes gold, and gold the capitals:
As heaven with stars, the roof with jewels glows,
And ever-living lamps depend in rows.
Full in the passage of each spacious gate,
The sage historians in white garments wait;

RHYME a a *

Graved o'er their seats the form of Time was found,
His scythe reversed, and both his pinions bound.
Within stood heroes, who through loud alarms
In bloody fields pursued renown in arms.       
High on a throne, with trophies charged, I view'd
The youth that all things but himself subdued;
His feet on sceptres and tiaras trod,
And his horn'd head belied the Libyan god.
There Caesar, graced with both Minervas, shone;
Caesar, the world's great master, and his own;
Unmoved, superior still in every state,
And scarce detested in his country's fate.

RHYME a a *

But chief were those, who not for empire fought,
But with their toils their people's safety bought:
High o'er the rest Epaminondas stood;
Timoleon, glorious in his brother's blood;
Bold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state;
Great in his triumphs, in retirement great;

RHYME a a a

And wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind,
With boundless power unbounded virtue join'd,
His own strict judge, and patron of mankind.

RHYME a a *

Much-suffering heroes next their honours claim,
Those of less noisy, and less guilty fame,
Fair Virtue's silent train: supreme of these   
Here ever shines the godlike Socrates:
He whom ungrateful Athens could expel,
At all times just, but when he sign'd the shell:
Here his abode the martyr'd Phocion claims,
With Agis, not the last of Spartan names:
Unconquer'd Cato shows the wound he tore,
And Brutus his ill Genius meets no more.

RHYME a a *

But in the centre of the hallow'd choir,
Six pompous columns o'er the rest aspire;
Around the shrine itself of Fame they stand,   
Hold the chief honours, and the fane command.
High on the first, the mighty Homer shone;
Eternal adamant composed his throne;
Father of verse! in holy fillets dress'd,
His silver beard waved gently o'er his breast;
Though blind, a boldness in his looks appears;
In years he seem'd, but not impair'd by years.
The wars of Troy were round the pillar seen:
Here fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen;

RHYME a a *

Here Hector, glorious from Patroclus' fall,    
Here dragg'd in triumph round the Trojan wall:
Motion and life did every part inspire,
Bold was the work, and proved the master's fire;
A strong expression most he seem'd to affect,
And here and there disclosed a brave neglect.

RHYME a a *

A golden column next in rank appear'd,
On which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd;
Finish'd the whole, and labour'd every part,
With patient touches of unwearied art:
The Mantuan there in sober triumph sate,       
Composed his posture, and his look sedate;
On Homer still he fix'd a reverend eye,
Great without pride, in modest majesty.

RHYME a a *

In living sculpture on the sides were spread
The Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead;
Eliza stretch'd upon the funeral pyre,
AEneas bending with his aged sire:
Troy flamed in burning gold, and o'er the throne,
ARMS AND THE MAN in golden cyphers shone.

RHYME a a *

Four swans sustain a car of silver bright,     
With heads advanced, and pinions stretch'd for flight:
Here, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode,
And seem'd to labour with the inspiring god.
Across the harp a careless hand he flings,
And boldly sinks into the sounding strings.

RHYME a a *

The figured games of Greece the column grace,
Neptune and Jove survey the rapid race.
The youths hang o'er their chariots as they run;
The fiery steeds seem starting from the stone;
The champions in distorted postures threat;    
And all appear'd irregularly great.

RHYME a a *

Here happy Horace tuned the Ausonian lyre
To sweeter sounds, and temper'd Pindar's fire:
Pleased with Alcaeus' manly rage t' infuse
The softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse.
The polish'd pillar different sculptures grace;
A work outlasting monumental brass.
Here smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear,
The Julian star, and great Augustus here;
The doves that round the infant poet spread    
Myrtles and bays, hung hovering o'er his head.

RHYME a a *

Here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light,
Sat, fix'd in thought, the mighty Stagyrite;
His sacred head a radiant zodiac crown'd,
And various animals his side surround;
His piercing eyes, erect, appear to view
Superior worlds, and look all Nature through.

RHYME a a *

With equal rays immortal Tully shone,
The Roman rostra deck'd the Consul's throne:
Gathering his flowing robe, he seem'd to stand 
In act to speak, and graceful stretch'd his hand.
Behind, Rome's Genius waits with civic crowns,
And the great Father of his country owns.

RHYME a a *

These massy columns in a circle rise,
O'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:
Scarce to the top I stretch'd my aching sight,
So large it spread, and swell'd to such a height.
Full in the midst, proud Fame's imperial seat
With jewels blazed, magnificently great;
The vivid emeralds there revive the eye,       
The flaming rubies show their sanguine dye,
Bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream,
And lucid amber casts a golden gleam.
With various-colour'd light the pavement shone,
And all on fire appear'd the glowing throne;
The dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze,
And forms a rainbow of alternate rays.
When on the goddess first I cast my sight,
Scarce seem'd her stature of a cubit's height;

RHYME a a *

But swell'd to larger size, the more I gazed,  
Till to the roof her towering front she raised.
With her, the temple every moment grew,
And ampler vistas open'd to my view:
Upward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend,
And arches widen, and long aisles extend.
Such was her form as ancient bards have told,
Wings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold;
A thousand busy tongues the goddess bears,
A thousand open eyes, and thousand listening ears.

RHYME a a *

Beneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine     
(Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine:
With eyes on Fame for ever fix'd, they sing;
For Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string;
With Time's first birth began the heavenly lays,
And last, eternal, through the length of days.

RHYME a a *

Around these wonders as I cast a look,
The trumpet sounded, and the temple shook,
And all the nations, summon'd at the call,
From different quarters fill the crowded hall:
Of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard 
In various garbs promiscuous throngs appear'd;
Thick as the bees, that with the spring renew
Their flowery toils, and sip the fragrant dew,
When the wing'd colonies first tempt the sky,
O'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly,
Or settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield,
And a low murmur runs along the field.
Millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend,
And all degrees before the goddess bend;

RHYME a a *

The poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage, 
And boasting youth, and narrative old age.
Their pleas were different, their request the same:
For good and bad alike are fond of Fame.
Some she disgraced, and some with honours crown'd;
Unlike successes equal merits found.
Thus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns,
And, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains.

RHYME a a *

First at the shrine the learned world appear,
And to the goddess thus prefer their prayer:
'Long have we sought to instruct and please mankind,
With studies pale, with midnight vigils blind;
But thank'd by few, rewarded yet by none,
We here appeal to thy superior throne;
On wit and learning the just prize bestow,
For fame is all we must expect below.'

RHYME a a *

The goddess heard, and bade the Muses raise
The golden trumpet of eternal praise:
From pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound,
That fills the circuit of the world around;
Not all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud;  
The notes at first were rather sweet than loud:
By just degrees they every moment rise,
Fill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies.
At every breath were balmy odours shed,
Which still grew sweeter as they wider spread;
Less fragrant scents the unfolding rose exhales,
Or spices breathing in Arabian gales.

RHYME a a *

Next these, the good and just, an awful train,
Thus on their knees address the sacred fane:
'Since living virtue is with envy cursed,      
And the best men are treated like the worst,
Do thou, just goddess, call our merits forth,
And give each deed the exact intrinsic worth.'

RHYME a a *

'Not with bare justice shall your act be crown'd,'
(Said Fame), 'but high above desert renown'd:
Let fuller notes the applauding world amaze,
And the loud clarion labour in your praise.'

RHYME a a *

This band dismiss'd, behold, another crowd
Preferr'd the same request, and lowly bow'd;
The constant tenor of whose well-spent days    
No less deserved a just return of praise.
But straight the direful trump of Slander sounds;
Through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds;
Loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies,
The dire report through every region flies,

RHYME a a *

In every ear incessant rumours rung,
And gathering scandals grew on every tongue.
From the black trumpet's rusty concave broke
Sulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:
The poisonous vapour blots the purple skies,   
And withers all before it as it flies.

RHYME a a *

A troop came next, who crowns and armour wore,
And proud defiance in their looks they bore:
'For thee' (they cried), 'amidst alarms and strife,
We sail'd in tempests down the stream of life;
For thee whole nations fill'd with flames and blood,
And swam to empire through the purple flood.
Those ills we dared, thy inspiration own,
What virtue seem'd, was done for thee alone.'

RHYME a a *

'Ambitious fools!' (the Queen replied, and frown'd)
'Be all your acts in dark oblivion drown'd;
There sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone,
Your statues moulder'd, and your names unknown!'
A sudden cloud straight snatch'd them from my sight,
And each majestic phantom sunk in night.

RHYME a a *

Then came the smallest tribe I yet had seen;
Plain was their dress, and modest was their mien.
'Great idol of mankind! we neither claim
The praise of merit, nor aspire to fame;
But safe in deserts from the applause of men,  
Would die unheard of, as we lived unseen;
'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight
Those acts of goodness which themselves requite.
Oh let us still the secret joy partake,
To follow virtue even for virtue's sake.'

RHYME a a *

'And live there men, who slight immortal Fame?
Who then with incense shall adore our name?
But, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride
To blaze those virtues which the good would hide.
Rise, Muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath;
These must not sleep in darkness and in death.'
She said: in air the trembling music floats,
And on the winds triumphant swell the notes;
So soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,
Even listening angels lean'd from heaven to hear:
To furthest shores the ambrosial spirit flies,
Sweet to the world, and grateful to the skies.

RHYME a a *

Next these a youthful train their vows express'd,
With feathers crown'd, with gay embroidery dress'd:
'Hither' (they cried) 'direct your eyes, and see 
The men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry;
Ours is the place at banquets, balls, and plays,
Sprightly our nights, polite are all our days;
Courts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care
To pay due visits, and address the fair:
In fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade,
But still in fancy vanquish'd every maid;
Of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell,
Yet, would the world believe us, all were well.
The joy let others have, and we the name,      
And what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.'

RHYME a a *

The Queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies,
And at each blast a lady's honour dies.

RHYME a a *

Pleased with the strange success, vast numbers press'd
Around the shrine, and made the same request:
'What! you,' (she cried) 'unlearn'd in arts to please,
Slaves to yourselves, and even fatigued with ease,
Who lose a length of undeserving days,
Would you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise?
To just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall,    
The people's fable and the scorn of all.'
Straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound,
Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round,
Whispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud,
And scornful hisses run through all the crowd.

RHYME a a *

Last, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done,
Enslave their country, or usurp a throne;
Or who their glory's dire foundation laid
On sovereigns ruin'd, or on friends betray'd;
Calm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix,
Of crooked counsels, and dark politics;
Of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne,
And beg to make the immortal treasons known.
The trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire,
With sparks, that seem'd to set the world on fire.
At the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast,
And startled Nature trembled with the blast.

RHYME a a *

This having heard and seen, some Power unknown
Straight changed the scene, and snatch'd me from the throne.
Before my view appear'd a structure fair,      
Its site uncertain, if in earth or air;
With rapid motion turn'd the mansion round;
With ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound;
Not less in number were the spacious doors,
Than leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores;
Which still unfolded stand, by night, by day,
Pervious to winds, and open every way.
As flames by nature to the skies ascend,
As weighty bodies to the centre tend,
As to the sea returning rivers roll,           
And the touch'd needle trembles to the pole;
Hither, as to their proper place, arise
All various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies,

RHYME a a *

Or spoke aloud, or whisper'd in the ear;
Nor ever silence, rest, or peace is here.
As on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes
The sinking stone at first a circle makes;
The trembling surface by the motion stirr'd,
Spreads in a second circle, then a third;
Wide, and more wide, the floating rings advance, 
Fill all the watery plain, and to the margin dance:
Thus every voice and sound, when first they break,
On neighbouring air a soft impression make;
Another ambient circle then they move;
That, in its turn, impels the next above;
Through undulating air the sounds are sent,
And spread o'er all the fluid element.

RHYME a a *

There various news I heard of love and strife,
Of peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life,
Of loss and gain, of famine and of store,      
Of storms at sea, and travels on the shore,
Of prodigies, and portents seen in air,
Of fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair,
Of turns of fortune, changes in the state,
The falls of favourites, projects of the great,
Of old mismanagements, taxations new:
All neither wholly false, nor wholly true.

RHYME a a *

Above, below, without, within, around,
Confused, unnumber'd multitudes are found,
Who pass, repass, advance, and glide away;      
Hosts raised by fear, and phantoms of a day:
Astrologers, that future fates foreshow;
Projectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few;
And priests, and party-zealots, numerous bands
With home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands;
Each talk'd aloud, or in some secret place,
And wild impatience stared in every face.
The flying rumours gather'd as they roll'd,
Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told;

RHYME a a a

And all who told it added something new,       
And all who heard it made enlargements too,
In every ear it spread, on every tongue it grew.

RHYME a a *

Thus flying east and west, and north and south,
News travell'd with increase from mouth to mouth.

RHYME a a *

So from a spark, that kindled first by chance,
With gathering force the quickening flames advance;
Till to the clouds their curling heads aspire,
And towers and temples sink in floods of fire.
When thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung,
Full grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue,  
Through thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow,
And rush in millions on the world below.
Fame sits aloft, and points them out their course,
Their date determines, and prescribes their force:
Some to remain, and some to perish soon;
Or wane and wax alternate like the moon.
Around, a thousand winged wonders fly,
Born by the trumpet's blast, and scatter'd through the sky.

RHYME a a *

There, at one passage, oft you might survey
A lie and truth contending for the way;        
And long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent,
Which first should issue through the narrow vent:
At last agreed, together out they fly,
Inseparable now, the truth and lie;
The strict companions are for ever join'd,
And this or that unmix'd, no mortal e'er shall find.

RHYME a a *

While thus I stood, intent to see and hear,
One came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:
'What could thus high thy rash ambition raise?
Art thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise?' 

RHYME a a *

''Tis true,' said I, 'not void of hopes I came,
For who so fond as youthful bards of fame?
But few, alas! the casual blessing boast,
So hard to gain, so easy to be lost.
How vain that second life in others' breath,
The estate which wits inherit after death!
Ease, health, and life, for this they must resign,
(Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine!)
The great man's curse, without the gains, endure,
Be envied, wretched, and be flatter'd, poor;   
All luckless wits their enemies profess'd,
And all successful, jealous friends at best.
Nor Fame I slight, nor for her favours call;
She comes unlook'd for, if she comes at all.
But if the purchase costs so dear a price,
As soothing folly, or exalting vice;
Oh! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway,
And follow still where fortune leads the way;
Or if no basis bear my rising name,
But the fallen ruins of another's fame;        
Then teach me, Heaven! to scorn the guilty bays,
Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise,
Unblemish'd let me live, or die unknown;
Oh, grant an honest fame, or grant me none!'

RHYME a a *

In these deep solitudes and awful cells,
Where heavenly-pensive Contemplation dwells,
And ever-musing Melancholy reigns,
What means this tumult in a vestal's veins?
Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?
Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?
Yet, yet I love!--From Abelard it came,
And Eloisa yet must kiss the name.

RHYME a a *

Dear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,
Nor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd:        
Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise
Where, mix'd with God's, his loved idea lies:
Oh write it not, my hand!--the name appears
Already written--wash it out, my tears!
In vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,
Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.

RHYME a a *

Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains
Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains:
Ye rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;
Ye grots and caverns, shagg'd with horrid thorn!   
Shrines! where their vigils pale-eyed virgins keep,
And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!
Though cold like you, unmoved and silent grown,
I have not yet forgot myself to stone.
All is not Heaven's while Abelard has part,
Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;
Nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,
Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain.

RHYME a a *

Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,
That well-known name awakens all my woes.          
Oh, name for ever sad! for ever dear!
Still breathed in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.
I tremble too, where'er my own I find,
Some dire misfortune follows close behind.
Line after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,
Led through a sad variety of woe;
Now warm in love, now withering in my bloom,
Lost in a convent's solitary gloom!
There stern religion quench'd the unwilling flame,
There died the best of passions, Love and Fame.    

RHYME a a *

Yet write, oh! write me all, that I may join
Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.
Nor foes nor fortune take this power away;
And is my Abelard less kind than they?
Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,
Love but demands what else were shed in prayer;
No happier task these faded eyes pursue;
To read and weep is all they now can do.

RHYME a a *

Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;
Ah, more than share it, give me all thy grief!     
Heaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,
Some banish'd lover, or some captive maid;
They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,
Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;
The virgin's wish without her fears impart,
Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,
Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,
And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.

RHYME a a *

Thou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,
When Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;   
My fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,
Some emanation of the all-beauteous Mind.
Those smiling eyes, attempering every ray,
Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.
Guiltless I gazed; Heaven listen'd while you sung;
And truths divine came mended from that tongue.
From lips like those, what precept fail'd to move?
Too soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love:
Back through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,
Nor wish'd an angel whom I loved a man.            
Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;
Nor envy them that heaven I lose for thee.

RHYME a a *

How oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,
Curse on all laws but those which Love has made!
Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,
Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.
Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,
August her deed, and sacred be her fame;           
Before true passion all those views remove;
Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?
The jealous god, when we profane his fires,
Those restless passions in revenge inspires,
And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,
Who seek in love for aught but love alone.
Should at my feet the world's great master fall,
Himself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn them all:
Not Caesar's empress would I deign to prove;
No, make me mistress to the man I love;
If there be yet another name more free,
More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!     
Oh, happy state! when souls each other draw,
When love is liberty, and nature law:
All then is full, possessing and possess'd,
No craving void left aching in the breast:
Even thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,
And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.
This, sure, is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)
And once the lot of Abelard and me.

RHYME a a *

Alas, how changed! what sudden horrors rise!
A naked lover bound and bleeding lies!         
Where, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,
Her poniard, had opposed the dire command.
Barbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;
The crime was common, common be the pain.
I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,
Let tears and burning blushes speak the rest.

RHYME a a *

Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,
When victims at yon altar's foot we lay?
Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,
When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?
As with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,
The shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale:
Heaven scarce believed the conquest it survey'd,
And saints with wonder heard the vows I made.
Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,
Not on the cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:
Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,
And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.
Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;
Those still at least are left thee to bestow.  
Still on that breast enamour'd let me lie,
Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,
Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;
Give all thou canst--and let me dream the rest.
Ah, no! instruct me other joys to prize,
With other beauties charm my partial eyes,
Full in my view set all the bright abode,
And make my soul quit Abelard for God.

RHYME a a *

Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,
Plants of thy hand, and children of thy prayer.
From the false world in early youth they fled,
By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.
You raised these hallow'd walls; the desert smiled,
And Paradise was open'd in the wild.
No weeping orphan saw his father's stores
Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;
No silver saints, by dying misers given,
Here bribed the rage of ill-requited Heaven:
But such plain roofs as Piety could raise,
And only vocal with the Maker's praise.        
In these lone walls, (their day's eternal bound)
These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,
Where awful arches make a noonday night,
And the dim windows shed a solemn light;
Thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray,
And gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.
But now no face divine contentment wears,
'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.
See how the force of others' prayers I try,
(Oh pious fraud of amorous charity!)           
But why should I on others' prayers depend?
Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!
Ah, let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,
And all those tender names in one--thy love!
The darksome pines that, o'er yon rocks reclined,
Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,
The wandering streams that shine between the hills,
The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,
The dying gales that pant upon the trees,
The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;   
No more these scenes my meditation aid,
Or lull to rest the visionary maid.
But o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,
Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,
Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws
A death-like silence, and a dread repose:
Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,
Shades every flower, and darkens every green,
Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,
And breathes a browner horror on the woods.    

RHYME a a *

Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;
Sad proof how well a lover can obey!
Death, only death, can break the lasting chain;
And here, even then, shall my cold dust remain;
Here all its frailties, all its flames resign,
And wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.

RHYME a a *

Ah, wretch! believed the spouse of God in vain,
Confess'd within the slave of love and man.
Assist me, Heaven! but whence arose that prayer?
Sprung it from piety, or from despair?         
Even here, where frozen chastity retires,
Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.
I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;
I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;
I view my crime, but kindle at the view,
Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;
Now turn'd to Heaven, I weep my past offence,
Now think of thee, and curse my innocence.
Of all affliction taught a lover yet,
'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!       
How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,
And love the offender, yet detest the offence?
How the dear object from the crime remove,
Or how distinguish penitence from love?
Unequal task! a passion to resign,
For hearts so touch'd, so pierced, so lost as mine.
Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,
How often must it love, how often hate!
How often hope, despair, resent, regret,
Conceal, disdain,--do all things but forget!   
But let Heaven seize it, all at once 'tis fired;
Not touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspired!
Oh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,
Renounce my love, my life, myself--and you.
Fill my fond heart with God alone, for He
Alone can rival, can succeed to thee.

RHYME a a *

How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!
The world forgetting, by the world forgot:
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!
Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd;  
Labour and rest, that equal periods keep;
'Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;'
Desires composed, affections ever even;
Tears that delight, and sighs that waft to heaven.
Grace shines around her with serenest beams,
And whispering angels prompt her golden dreams.
For her the unfading rose of Eden blooms,
And wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes;
For her the spouse prepares the bridal ring,
For her white virgins hymeneals sing,          
To sounds of heavenly harps she dies away,
And melts in visions of eternal day.

RHYME a a *

Far other dreams my erring soul employ,
Far other raptures, of unholy joy:
When at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,
Fancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,
Then conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,
All my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.
O curst, dear horrors of all-conscious night!
How glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!     
Provoking demons all restraint remove,
And stir within me every source of love.
I hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,
And round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.
I wake:--no more I hear, no more I view,
The phantom flies me, as unkind as you.
I call aloud; it hears not what I say:
I stretch my empty arms; it glides away.
To dream once more I close my willing eyes;
Ye soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!        
Alas, no more! methinks we wandering go
Through dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,
Where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps,
And low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.
Sudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;
Clouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.
I shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,
And wake to all the griefs I left behind.

RHYME a a *

For thee the Fates, severely kind, ordain
A cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;   
Thy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose;
No pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.
Still as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,
Or moving spirit bade the waters flow;
Soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven,
And mild as opening gleams of promised heaven.

RHYME a a *

Come, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?
The torch of Venus burns not for the dead.
Nature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;
Even thou art cold--yet Eloisa loves.          
Ah hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn
To light the dead, and warm the unfruitful urn.

RHYME a a *

What scenes appear where'er I turn my view?
The dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,
Rise in the grove, before the altar rise,
Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.
I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,
Thy image steals between my God and me,
Thy voice I seem in every hymn to hear,
With every bead I drop too soft a tear.        
When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,
And swelling organs lift the rising soul,
One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,
Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:
In seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,
While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.

RHYME a a *

While prostrate here in humble grief I lie,
Kind, virtuous drops just gathering in my eye,
While praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,
And dawning grace is opening on my soul:       
Come, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!
Oppose thyself to heaven; dispute my heart;
Come, with one glance of those deluding eyes
Blot out each bright idea of the skies;
Take back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;
Take back my fruitless penitence and prayers;
Snatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;
Assist the fiends, and tear me from my God!

RHYME a a *

No, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;
Rise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!   
Ah, come not, write not, think not once of me,
Nor share one pang of all I felt for thee!
Thy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;
Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.
Fair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view)
Long loved, adored ideas, all adieu!
O Grace serene! O Virtue heavenly fair!
Divine oblivion of low-thoughted care!
Fresh blooming Hope, gay daughter of the sky!  
And Faith, our early immortality!
Enter, each mild, each amicable guest;
Receive, and wrap me in eternal rest!

RHYME a a *

See in her cell sad Eloisa spread,
Propp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.
In each low wind methinks a spirit calls,
And more than echoes talk along the walls.
Here, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,
From yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.
'Come, sister, come!' (it said, or seem'd to say)
'Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!     
Once like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,
Love's victim then, though now a sainted maid:
But all is calm in this eternal sleep;
Here Grief forgets to groan, and Love to weep,
Even Superstition loses every fear:
For God, not man, absolves our frailties here.'

RHYME a a *

I come, I come! prepare your roseate bowers,
Celestial palms, and ever-blooming flowers.
Thither, where sinners may have rest, I go,
Where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow: 
Thou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,
And smooth my passage to the realms of day;
See my lips tremble, and my eyeballs roll,
Suck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!
Ah, no!--in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,
The hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,
Present the cross before my lifted eye,
Teach me at once, and learn of me to die.
Ah, then thy once-loved Eloisa see!
It will be then no crime to gaze on me.        
See from my cheek the transient roses fly!
See the last sparkle languish in my eye!
Till every motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;
And even my Abelard be loved no more.
O Death all-eloquent! you only prove
What dust we doat on when 'tis man we love.

RHYME a a *

Then too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,
(That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy!)
In trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,
Bright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round, 
From opening skies may streaming glories shine,
And saints embrace thee with a love like mine.

RHYME a a *

May one kind grave unite each hapless name,
And graft my love immortal on thy fame!
Then, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,
When this rebellious heart shall beat no more;
If ever chance two wandering lovers brings
To Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,
O'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,
And drink the falling tears each other sheds;  
Then sadly say,--with mutual pity moved,
'Oh, may we never love as these have loved!'
From the full choir when loud hosannas rise,
And swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,
Amid that scene, if some relenting eye
Glance on the stone where our cold relics lie,
Devotion's self shall steal a thought from heaven,
One human tear shall drop, and be forgiven.
And sure, if Fate some future bard shall join
In sad similitude of griefs to mine,           
Condemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,
And image charms he must behold no more;
Such if there be, who love so long, so well,
Let him our sad, our tender story tell;
The well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;
He best can paint them who shall feel them most.

RHYME a a *

Such were the notes thy once-loved Poet sung,
Till Death untimely stopp'd his tuneful tongue.
Oh just beheld and lost! admired and mourn'd!
With softest manners, gentlest arts adorn'd!
Blest in each science, blest in every strain!
Dear to the Muse! to Harley dear--in vain!

RHYME a a *

For him, thou oft hast bid the world attend,
Fond to forget the statesman in the friend;
For Swift and him, despised the farce of state,
The sober follies of the wise and great;           
Dext'rous, the craving, fawning crowd to quit,
And pleased to 'scape from Flattery to Wit.

RHYME a a *

Absent or dead, still let a friend be dear,
(A sigh the absent claims, the dead a tear,)
Recall those nights that closed thy toilsome days,
Still hear thy Parnell in his living lays,
Who, careless now of interest, fame, or fate,
Perhaps forgets that Oxford e'er was great;
Or deeming meanest what we greatest call,
Behold thee glorious only in thy fall.             

RHYME a a *

And sure, if aught below the seats divine
Can touch immortals, 'tis a soul like thine:
A soul supreme, in each hard instance tried,
Above all pain, all passion, and all pride,
The rage of power, the blast of public breath,
The lust of lucre, and the dread of death.

RHYME a a *

In vain to deserts thy retreat is made;
The Muse attends thee to thy silent shade:
'Tis hers the brave man's latest steps to trace,
Rejudge his acts, and dignify disgrace.            
When interest calls off all her sneaking train,
And all the obliged desert, and all the vain,
She waits, or to the scaffold, or the cell,
When the last lingering friend has bid farewell.
Even now she shades thy evening-walk with bays,
(No hireling she, no prostitute to praise),
Even now, observant of the parting ray,
Eyes the calm sunset of thy various day;
Through Fortune's cloud one truly great can see,
Nor fears to tell that Mortimer is he.

RHYME a b a b 

With ekes and alsos tack thy strain, 
Great bard ; and sing the deathless prince, 
Who lost Namur the same campaign, 
He bought Dixmuyd, and pUinder'd Deynse. 

RHYME a b a b *

I'll hold ten pound my dream is out : 
I'd tell it you, but for the rattle 
Of those confounded drums ; no doubt 
Yon bloody rogues intend a battle. 
Dear me ! a hundred thousand French 
With terror fill the neighb'ring field : 
While William carries on the trench, 
Till both the town and castle yield. 
Villeroy to Boufflers should advance, 
Says Mars, through cannons' mouths in fire ; 
Id est, one mareschal of France 
Tells t'other, he can come no nigher. 
Regain the lines the shortest way, 
Villeroy ; or to Versailles take post ; 
For, having seen it, thou canst say 
The steps, by which Namur was lost. 

RHYME a b a b *

The smoke and fiame may vex thy sight : 
Look not once back : but as thou goest, 
Quicken the squadrons in their flight, 
And bid the d â€” a  take the slowest. 
Think not what reason to produce, 
From Louis to conceal thy fear : 
He a a  own the strength of thy excuse ; 
Tell him that William was but there. 

RHYME a b a b *

Now let us look for Louis' feather, 
That us'd to shine so like a star : 
The gen'rals could not g'et together, 
Wanting that influence, great in war. 
O Poet ! thou hadst been discreeter, 
Hanging the monarch's hat so high ; 
If thou hadst dubb'd thy star a meteor. 
That did but blaze, and rove, and die. 

RHYME a b a b *

To animate the doubtful fight, 
Namur in vain expects that ray : 
In vain France hopes, the sickly light 
Should shine near William's fuller day : 
It knows Versailles, its proper station ; 
Nor cares for any foreign sphere : 
Where you see Boileau's constellation, 
Be sure no danger can be near. 

RHYME a b a b *

The French had gather'd all their force ; 
And William met them in their way : 
Yet oÂ£f they brush'd, both foot and horse. 
What has friend Boileau left to say ? 

RHYME a b a b *

When his high Muse is bent upon't, 
To sing her king â€” that great commander, 
Or on the shores of Hellespont, 
Or in the valleys near. Scamander ; 

RHYME a b a b *

Would it not spoil his noble task. 
If any foolish Phrygian there is 
Impertinent enough to ask. 
How far Namur may be from Paris. 

RHYME a b a b *

Two stanzas more before we end, 
Of death, pikes, rocks, arms, bricks, and fire : 
Leave them behind you, honest friend ; 
And with your countrymen retire. 

RHYME a b a b *

Your ode is spoilt ; Namur is freed ; 
For Dixmuyd something yet is due : 
â– ^0 good Count Guiscard may proceed; * 
But Boufflers, Sir, one word with you

RHYME a b a b *

"Tis done. In sight of these commanders, 
Who neither fight, nor raise the siege, 
The foes of France march safe through Flanders ; 
Divide to Bruxelles, or to Liege. 

RHYME a b a b *

Send, Fame, this news to Trianon, 
That Boufflers may new honours gain : 
He the same play by land has shown. 
As Tour^^lle did upon the main.

RHYME a b a b *

Yet is the marshal made a peer ! 
O William, may thy arms advance ; 
That he may lose Dinant next year, 
And so be constable of France. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Ye careful angels, whom eternal Fate 
Ordains, on earth and human acts to wait ; 
Who turn with secret power this restless ball, 
And bid predestin'd empires rise and fall : 
Your sacred aid religious monarchs own, 
When first they merit, then ascend the throne : 
But tyrants dread ye, lest your just decree 
Transfer the power, and set the people free. 
See rescu'd Britain at your altars bow ; 
And hear her hymns your happy care avow : 
That still her axes and her rods support 
The judge's frown, and grace the awful court ; 
That Law with all her pompous terror stands, 
To wrest the dagger from the traitor's hands ; 
And rigid justice reads the fatal word, 
Poises the balance first, then draws the sword. 

RHYME a a *

Britain her safety to your guidance owns, 
That she can sep'rate parricides from sons ; 
That, impious rage disarm'd, she lives and reigns, 
Her freedom kept by him, who broke her chains. 

RHYME a a *

And thou, great minister, above the rest 
Of guardian spirits, be thou for ever blest ; 
Thou, who of old wert sent to Israel's court, 
With secret aid great David's strong support ; 
To mock the frantic rage of cruel Saul, 
And strike the useless javelin to the wall. 
Thy later care o'er William's temples held. 
On Boyne's propitious banks, the heav'nly shield ; 
When power divine did sovereign right declare, 
And cannons mark'dwhom they were bid to spare. 

RHYME a a *

Still, blessed angel, be thy care the same ! 
Be William's life untouch'd, as is his fame ! 
Let him own thine, as Britain owns his hand : 
Save thou the king, as he has sav'd the land ! 

RHYME a a *

We angels' forms in pious monarchs view ; 
We reverence William ; for he acts like you ; 
Like you, commission'd to chastise and bless, 
He must avenge the world, and give it peace. 

RHYME a a *

Indulgent Fate our potent prayer receives ; 
And still Britannia smiles, and William lives. 
The hero dear to earth, by heav'n belov'd. 
By troubles must be vex'd, by dangers prov'd : 
His foes must aid to make his fame complete. 
And fix his throne secure on their defeat. 

RHYME a a *

So, though with sudden rage the tempest comes; 
Though the winds roar, and though the water foams, 

RHYME a a *

Imperial Britain on the sea looks down, 
And smiling sees her rebel subject frown : 
Striking her cliff, the storm confirms her pow'r ; 
The waves but whiten her triumphant shore : 
In vain they would advance, in vain retreat : 
Broken they dash, and perish at her feet. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d e e f f g g 

For William still new wonders shall be shown : 
The powers that rescued, shall preserve the throne. 
Safe on his darling Britain's joyful sea, 
Behold, the monarch ploughs his liquid way : 
His fleets in thunder through the world declare, 
Whose empire they obey, whose arms they bear. 
Bless'd by aspiring winds, he finds the strand 
Blacken'd with clouds ; he sees the nations stand 
Blessing his safety, proud of his command. 
In vsirious tongues he hears the captains dwell 
On their great leader's praise ; by turns they tell, 
And listen, each with emulous glory fir'd. 
How William conquer'd, and how France retir'd ; 
How Belgia freed the hero's arm confess'd, 
But trembled for the courage which she bless'd. 

RHYME a a *

O Louis, from this great example know. 
To be at once a hero, and a foe : 
By sounding trumpets, hear, and rattling drums. 
When William to the open vengeance comes : 
And see the soldier plead the monarch's right, 
Heading his troops, and foremost in the fight. 

RHYME a a *

Hence then, close Ambush and perfidious War, 
Down to your native seats of Night repair. 
And thou, Bellona, weep thy cruel pride 
Restraiii'd, behind the victor's chariot tied 
In brazen knots, and everlasting chains, 
(So Europe's peace, so William's fate ordains). 
While on the ivory chair, in happy state. 
He sits, secure in innocence, and great 
In regal clemency ; and views beneath 
Averted darts of rage, and pointless arms of death. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

See, whilst thou weep'st, fair Cloe, see 
The world in sympathy with thee. 
The cheerful birds no longer sing ; 
Each droops his head, and hangs his wing. 
The clouds have bent their bosom lower, 
And shed their sorrows in a shower. 
The brooks beyond their limits flow ; 
And louder murmurs speak their woe. 
The nymphs and swains adopt thy cares ; 
They heave thy sighs, and weep thy tears. 
Fantastic nymph ! that grief should move 
Thy heart obdurate against Love. 
Strange tears ! whose power can soften all. 
But that dear breast on which they fall. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

Dear Howard, from the soft assaults of Love, 
Poets and painters never are secure ; 
Can I untouch'd the fair ones' passions move ? 
Or thou draw beauty, and not feel its power ? 

RHYME a b a b 

To great Apelles when young Aramon brought * 
The darling idol of his captive heart ; 
And the pleas'd nymph with kind attention sat, 
To have her charms recorded by his art : 

RHYME a b a b 

The am'rous master own'd her potent eyes ; 
Sigh'd when he look'd, and trembled as he drew ; 
Each flowing line confirm'd his first surprise, 
And as the piece advanc'd, the passion grew. 

RHYME a b a b 

While Philip's son, while Venus' son was near. 
What different tortures does his bosom feel ! 
Great was the rival, and the god severe : 
Nor could he hide his flame, nor durst reveal. 

RHYME a b a b 

The prince, renown'd in bounty as in arms. 
With pity saw the ill-conceal'd distress ; 
Quitted his title to Campaspe's charms, 
And gave the fair one to the friend's embrace. 

RHYME a b a b 

Thus the more beauteous Cloe sat to thee, 
Good Howard, emulous of the Grecian art: 
But happy thou, from Cupid's arrow free, 
And flames that pierc'd thy predecessor's heart. 

RHYME a b a b 

Had thy poor breast receiv'd an equal pain ; 
Had I been vested with the monarch's power; 
Thou must have sigh'd, unlucky youth, in vain ; 
Nor from my bounty hadst thou found a cure. 

RHYME a b a b 

Though to convince thee, that the friend did feel 
A kind concern for thy ill-fated care, 
I would have sooth'd the flame I could not heal ; 
Giv'n thee the world, though I withheld the fair. 

TITLE

RHYME a a b b c c c 

Beneath a myrtle's verdant shade 
As Cloe half asleep was laid, 
Cupid perch'd lightly on her breast, 
And in that heav'n desir'd to rest : 
Over her paps his wings he spread : 
Between he found a downy bed, 
And nestled in his little head. 

RHYME a a b b 

Still lay the god : the nymph surpris'd, 
Yet mistress of herself, devis'd 
How she the vagrant might enthral, 
And captive him, who captives all. 

RHYME a a a 

Her bodice half-way she unlac'd ; 
About his arms she shiy cast 
The silken bond, and held him fast. 

RHYME a a b b 

The god awak'd ; and thrice in vain 
He strove to break the cruel chain ; 
And thrice in vain he shook his wing, 
Incumber'd in the silken string. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

Flutt'ring the god, and weeping said, 
Pity poor Cupid, generous maid, 
Who happen'd, being blind, to stray, 
And on thy bosom lost his way ; 
Who stray'd, alas ! but knew too well, 
He never there must hope to dwell : 
Set an unhappy pris'ner free. 
Who ne'er intended harm to thee. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

To me pertains not, she replies, 
To know or care where Cupid flies ; 
What are his haunts, or which his way ; 
Where he would dwell, or whither stray : 
Yet will I never set thee free : 
For harm was meant, and harm to me. 

RHYME a a b b 

Vain fears that vex thy virgin heart ! 
I'll give thee up my bow and dart; 
Untangle but this cruel chain, 
And freely let me fly again. 

RHYME a a b b 

Agreed : secure my virgin heart : 
Instant give up thy bow and dart: 
The chain I'll in return untie ; 
And freely thou again shalt fly. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Thus she the captive did deliver ; 
The captive thus gave up his quiver. 
The god disarm'd, e'er since that day 
Passes his life in harmless play : 
Flies round, or sits upon her breast, 
A little, fluttering, idle guest. 

RHYME a a *

E'er since that day the beauteous maid 
Governs the world in Cupid's stead ; 
Directs his arrow as she wills ; 
Gives grief, or pleasure ; spares, or kills. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

Behind her neck her comely tresses tied, 
Her ivory quiver graceful by her side, 
A-hunting Cloe went : she lost her way, 
And through the woods uncertain chanc'd to stray, 
Apollo passing by beheld the maid ; 
And, Sister dear, bright Cynthia, turn, he said : 
The hunted hind lies close in yonder brake. 
Loud Cupid laugh'd, to see the god's mistake ; 
And laughing, cried, Learn better, great divine. 
To know thy kindred, and to honour mine. 
Rightly advis'd, far hence thy sister seek. 
Or on Meander's bank, or Latmus' peak. 
But in this nymph, my friend, my sister know : 
She draws my arrows, and she bends my bow : 
Fair Thames she haunts, and every neighb'ring grove, 
Sacred to soft recess, and gentle love. 
Go, with thy Cynthia, hurl the pointed spear 
At the rough boar, or chase the flying deer : 
I and my Cloe take a nobler aim : 
At human hearts we fling, nor ever miss the game.

RHYME a a *

In Heaven, one holiday, you read 
In wise Anacreon, Ganymede 
Drew heedless Cupid in, to throw 
A main, to pass an hour, or so. 
The little Trojan, by the way. 
By Hermes taught, play'd all the play. 

RHYME a a *

The god unhappily engag'd. 
By nature rash, by play enrag'd, 
Complain'd, and sigh'd, and cried, and fretted 
Lost every earthly thing he betted : 
In ready-money, all the store 
Pick'd up long since from Dana'e's shower ; 
A snuff-box, set with bleeding hearts. 
Rubies, all pierc'd with diamond darts ; 
His nine-pins made of myrtle wood 
(The tree in Ida's forest stood) ; 
His bowl pure gold, the very same 
Which Paris gave the Cyprian dame ; 
Two table-books in shagreen covers ; 
Fill'd with good verse from real lovers ; 

RHYME a a *

Merchandise rare ! a billet-doux, 
Its matter passionate, yet true ; 
Heaps of hair rings, and cipher'd seals ; 
Rich trifles ; serious bagatelles. 

RHYME a a *

What sad disorders play begets ! 
Desperate and mad, at length he sets 
Those darts, whose points make gods adore 
His might, and deprecate his power : 
Those darts, whence all our joy and pain 
Arise : those darts â€” Come, seven's the main. 
Cries Ganymede : the usual trick : 
Seven, slur a six ; eleven, a nick. 

RHYME a a *

Ill news goes fast : 'twas quickly known. 
That simple Cupid was undone. 
Swifter than lightning Venus flew : 
Too late she found the thing too true. 
Guess how the goddess greets her son : 
Come hither, sirrah : no, begone ; 

RHYME a a *

And, hark ye, is it so indeed ? 
A comrade you for Ganymede ? 
An imp as wicked, for his age. 
As any earthly lady's page ; 
A scandal and a scourge to Troy ; 
A prince's son ! a black -guard boy ; 
A sharper, that with box and dice 
Draws in young deities to vice. 
All Heaven is by the ears together. 
Since first that little rogue came hither: 
Juno herself has had no peace : 
And truly I've been favour'd less : 

RHYME a a *

For Jove, as Fame reports (but Fame 
Says things not fit for me to name), 
Has acted ill for such a god, 
And taken ways extremely odd. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

And thou, unhappy child, she said 
(Her anger by her grief allay'd), 
Unhappy child, who thus hast lost 
All the estate we e'er could boast ; 
Whither, O whither wilt thou run. 
Thy name despis'd, thy weakness known ? 
Nor shall thy shrine on earth be crown'd ; 
Nor shall thy power in Heaven be own'd ; 
When thou, nor man, nor god canst wound. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Obedient Cupid kneeling cried. 
Cease, dearest mother, cease to chide : 
Gany's a cheat, and I'm a bubble : 
Yet why this great excess of trouble ? 
The dice were false : the darts are gone : 
Yet how are you or I undone ? 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

The loss of these I can supply 
With keener shafts from Cloe's eye : 
Fear not, we e'er can be disgrac'd, 
While that bright magazine shall last : 
Your crowded altars still shall smoke ; 
And man your friendly aid invoke : 
Jove shall again revere your power, 
And rise a swan, or fall a shower.

As after noon, one summer's day, 
Venus stood bathing in a river, 
Cupid a-shooting went that way. 
New stnmg his bow, new fill'd his quiver. 

RHYME a b a b 

With skill he chose his sharpest dart. 
With all his might his bow he drew ; 
Swift to his beauteous parent's heart 
The too well-guided arrow flew. 

RHYME a b a b 

I faint ! I die ! the goddess cried ; 
cruel, couldst thou find none other, 
To wreck thy spleen on ? Parricide ! 
Like Nero, thou hast slain thy mother. 

RHYME a b a b 

Poor Cupid sobbing scarce could speak ; 
Indeed, mamma, I did not know ye : 
Alas ! how easy my mistake ; 
I took you for your likeness Cloe. 

RHYME a a b b 

When Cloe's picture was to Venus shown, 
I Surpris'd, the goddess took it for her own. 
And what, said she, does this bold painter mean? 
When was I bathing thus, and naked seen? 

RHYME a b a b 

Pleas'd Cupid heard, and check'd his mother's pride : 
And who's blind now, mamma ? the urchin cried. 
'Tis Cloe's eye, and cheek, and lip, and breast : 
Friend Howard's g^enius fancied all the rest.

RHYME a b a b *

If wine and music have the power 
To ease the sickness of the soul ; 
Let Phoebus ever)" string explore ; 
And Bacchus fill the sprig-htly bowl. 
Let them their friendly aid employ. 
To make my Cloe's absence light ; 
And seek for pleasure, to destroy 
The sorrows of this live-long night. 

RHYME a b a b *

But she to-morrow will return ; 
Venus, be thou to-morrow great ; 
Thy myrtles strow, thy odours burn ; 
And meet thy fav'rite nymph in state. 
Kind goddess, to no other powers 
Let us to-morrow's blessings own : 
Thy darling loves shall gniide the hours, 
And all the day be thine alone. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b *

In Virgil's sacred verse we find. 
That passion can depress or raise 
The heavenly as the human mind : 
Who dare deny what Virgil says ? 

RHYME a b a b *

But if they should, what our great master 
Has thus laid down, my tale shall prove. 
Fair Venus wept the sad disaster 
Of having lost her favourite Dove. 

RHYME a b a b *

In complaisance poor Cupid mourn'd ; 
His grief reliev'd his mother's pain ; 
He vow'd he'd leave no stone unturn'd. 
But she should have her Dove again. 

RHYME a b a b *

Though none, said he, shall yet be nam'd. 
I know the felon well enough : 
But be she not, mamma, condemn'd 
Without a fair and legal proof. 

RHYME a b a b *

With that, his longest dart he took, 
As constable would take his staff: 
That gods desire like men to look, 
Would make e'en Heraclitus laugh. 

RHYME a b a b *

Love's subalterns, a duteous band, 
Like watchmen round their chief appear : 
Each had his lantern in his hand : 
And Venus mask'd brought up the rear. 

RHYME a b a b *

Accoutred thus, their eager step 
To Cloe's lodging they directed : 
(At once I write, alas ! and weep, 
That Cloe is of theft suspected.) 

RHYME a b a b *

Late they set out, had far to go : 
St. Dunstan's, as they pass'd, struck one. 
Cloe, for reasons good, you know, 
Lives at the sober end o' th' town. 

RHYME a b a b *

With one great peal they rap the door. 
Like footmen on a visiting day. 
Folks at her house at such an hour ! 
Lord ! what will all the neighbours say ? 

RHYME a b a b *

The door is open : up they run : 
Nor prayers, nor threats divert their speed : 
Thieves! thieves! cries Susan ; Ave're undone; 
They'll kill my mistress in her bed. 

RHYME a b a b *

In bed indeed the nymph had been 
Three hours : for all historians say, 
She commonly went up at ten, 
Unless piquet was in the way. 

RHYME a b a b *

She wak'd, he sure, with strangle surprise, 
O Cupid, is this right or law, 
Thus to disturb the brightest eyes. 
That ever slept, or ever saw ? 

RHYME a b a b *

Have you observ'd a sitting- hare, 
Listening, and fearful of the storm 
Of horns and hounds, clap back her ear. 
Afraid to keep, or leave her form ? 

RHYME a b a b *

Or have you mark'd a partridge quake. 
Viewing the towering falcon nigh ? 
She cuddles low behind the brake : 
Nor would she stay ; nor dares she fly. 

RHYME a b a b *

Then have you seen the beauteous maid ; 
When gazing on her midnight foes, 
She turn'd each way her frighted head. 
Then sunk it deep beneath the clothes. 

RHYME a b a b *

Venus this while was in the chamber 
Incognito : for Susan said. 
It smelt so strong of myrrh and amber 
And Susan is no lying maid. 

RHYME a b a b *

But since we have no present need 
Of Venus for an episode, 
With Cupid let us e'en proceed ; 
And thus to Cloe spoke the god : 

RHYME a b a b *

Hold up your head : hold up your hand : 
Would it were not my lot to show ye 
This cruel writ, wherein you stand 
Indicted by the name of Cloe ; 

RHYME a b a b *

For that by secret malice stirr'd, 
Or by an emulous pride invited, 
You have purloin'd the fav'i-ite bird, 
In which my mother most delighted 

RHYME a b a b *

Her blushing face the lovely maid 
Rais'd just above the milk-white sheet, 
A rose-tree in a lily bed 
Nor glows so red, nor breathes so sweet. 

RHYME a b a b *

Are you not he whom virgins fear. 
And widows court ? is not your name 
Cupid ? If so, pray come not near
Fair maiden, I'm the very same. 

RHYME a b a b *

Then what have I, good Sir, to say, 
Or do with hsr, you call your mother '' 
If I should meet her in my way. 
We hardly courtesy to each other. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b *

Diana chaste, and Hebe sweet, 
Witness that what I speak is true : 
I would not give my paroquet 
For all the Doves that ever flew. 

RHYME a b a b *

Yet, to compose this midnight noise, 
Go freely search where er you please : 
(The rage that rais'd, adorn'd her voice) 
Upon yon toilet lie my keys. 

RHYME a b a b *

Her keys he takes ; her doors unlocks : 
Through wardrobe, and through closet bounces 
Peeps into eveiy chest and box ; 
Turns all her furbelows and flounces. 

RHYME a b a b *

But Dove, depend on't, finds he none ; 
So to the bed returns again : 
And now the maiden, bolder grown, 
Begins to treat him with disdain. 

RHYME a b a b *

I marvel much, she smiling said. 
Your poultry cannot yet be found : 
Lies he in yonder slipper dead, 
Or may be, in the tea-pot drown'd ? 

RHYME a b a b *

No, traitor, angry Love replies. 
He's hid somewhere about your breast ; 
A place nor god nor man denies. 
For Venus' Dove the proper nest. 

RHYME a b a b *

Search then, she said, put in your hand, 
And Cynthia, dear protectress, guard me ; 
As guilty I, or free may stand. 
Do thou, or punish, or reward me. 

RHYME a b a b *

But ah ! what maid to Love can trust; 
He scorns, and breaks all legal power : 
Into her breast his hand he thrust ; 
And in a moment forc'd it lower. 

RHYME a b a b *

U, whither do those fingers rove. 
Cries Cloe, treacherous urchin, whither ? 
O Venus ! I shall find thy Dove, 
Savs he ; for sure I touch his feather. 

TITLE

RHYME a a *

As Cloe came into the room t'other day, 
I peevish began ; where so long could you stay ? 
In your life-time you never regarded your hour : 
You promis'd at two ; and (pray look, child) 'tis four. 
A lady's watch needs neither figures nor wheels : 
'Tis enough, that 'tis loaded with bawbles and seals. 
A temper so heedless no mortal can bear
Thus far I went on with a resolute air. 
Lord bless me, said she ; let a body but speak : 
Hero's an ugly hard rose-bud fallen into my neck ; 

RHYME a a *

It has hurt me, and vex'd me to such a degree 
See here ! for you never believe me ; pray see, 
On the left side my breast what a mark it has made ! 
So saying, her bosom she careless display'd : 
That seat of delight I with wonder suited
And forgot every word I designed to have said. 

RHYME a a *

In sullen humour one day Jove 
Sent Hermes down to Ida's grove, 
Commanding Cupid to deliver 
His store of darts, his total quiver ; 
That Hermes should the weapons break, 
Or throw 'em into Lethe's lake. 

RHYME a a *

Hermes, you know, must do his errand 
He found his man, produc'd his warrant ; 
Cupid, your darts â€” this very hour
There's no contending against power. 

RHYME a a *

How sullen Jupiter, just now, 
I think I said ; and you'll allow. 
That Cupid was as bad as he : 
Hear but the youngster's repartee. 

RHYME a a *

Come, kinsman (said the little god). 
Put off your wings, lay by your rod ; 
Retire with me to yonder bower. 
And rest yourself for half an hour : 
'Tis far indeed from hence to Heaven : 
But you fly fast ; and 'tis but seven. 
We'll take one cooling cup of nectar ; 
And drink to this celestial hector 

RHYME a a *

He break my dart, or hurt my power ! 
He, Leda's swan, and Danae's shower ! 
Go, bid him his wife's tongue restrain. 
And mind his thunder, and his rain. â€” 
My darts ! O certainly I'll give 'em : 
From Cloe's eyes he shall receive 'em. 
There's one, the best in all my quiver, 
Twang ! through his very heart and liver, 
He then shall pine, and sigh, and rave : 
Good lord ! what bustle shall we have ! 

RHYME a a *

Neptune must straight be sent to sea. 
And Flora summon'd twice a day : 
One must find shells, and t'other flowers, 
For cooling grots, and fragrant bowers. 
That Cloe may be serv'd in state : 
The Hours must at her toilet wait : 
Whilst all the reasoning fools below 
Wonder their watches go too slow, 
Lybs must fly south, and Eurus east, 
For jewels for her hair and breast : 

RHYME a a *

No matter though their cruel haste 
Sink cities, and lay forests waste. 
No matter though this fleet be lost ; 
Or that lie wind-bound on the coast. 
What whispering in my mother's ear ! 
What care, that Juno should not hear ! 
What woik among you scholar gods ! 
Phcebus must write him am'rous odes : 

RHYME a a *

And thou, poor cousin, must compose 
His letters in submissive prose ; 
Whilst haughty Cloe, to sustain 
The honour of my mystic reig-n. 
Shall all his gifts and vows disdain ; 
And laugh at your old bully's pain. 
Dear couz., said Hermes in a fright. 
For Heaven's sake, keep your darts ! good night. 

RHYME a a *

Resolve me, Cloe, what is this : 
Or forfeit me one precious kiss. 
'Tis the first oflfspring of the Graces ; 
Bears difterent forms in different places ; 
Acknowledg'd fine, where'er beheld ; 
Yet fancied finer, when conceal'd. 
'Twas Flora's wealth, and Circe's charm ; 
Pandora's box of good and harm : 
'Twas Mars's wish, Endymion's dream ; 
Apelles' draught, and Ovid's theme. 
This guided Theseus through the maze ; 
And sent him home with life and praise. 
But this undid the Phiygian boy ; 
And blew the flames that ruin'd Troy. 
This show'd great kindness to old Greece, 
And help'd rich Jason to the fleece. 
This through the east just vengeance hurl'd. 
And lost poor Anthony the world. 

RHYME a a *

Injur'd, though Lucrece found her doom ; 
This banish'd tyranny from Rome. 
Appeas'd though Lais gain'd her hire ; 
This set Persepolis on fire. 
For this Alcides learn'd to spin : 
His club laid down, and lion's skin. 
For this Apollo deign'd to keep, 
Witli servile care, a mortal's sheep. 

RHYME a a *

For this the father of the gods, 
Content to leave his high abodes. 
In borrow'd figures loosely ran, 
Europa's bull, and Leda's swan, 
For this he'reassumes the nod, 
(While Semele commands the God) 
Launches the bolt, and shakes the poles ; 
Though Momus laughs, and Juno scolds. 

RHYME a a *

Here listening' Cloe smil'd and said ; 
Your riddle is not hard to read : 
a  guess it â€” fair one, if you do; 
Need I , alas I the theme pursue ? 
For this thou see'st, for this I leave, 
Whate'er the world thinks wise or grave, 

RHYME a a *

Ambition, business, friendship, news. 
My useful books, and serious Muse. 
For this I willingly decline 
The mirth of feasts, and joys of wine ; 
And choose to sit and talk with thee, 
(As thy groat orders may decree) 
Of cocks and bulls, and flutes and fiddles, 
Of idle tales, and foolish riddles.

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e e f f 

What nymph should I admire, or trust, 
But Cloe, beauteous Cloe, just ? 
What nymph should I desire to see, 
But her who leaves the plain for me ? 
To whom should I compose the lay, 
But her who listens when I play ? 
To whom, in song^, repeat my cares, 
But her who in my sorrow shares ? 
For whom should I the garland make, 
But her who joys the gift to take, 
And boasts she wears it for my sake ? 
In love am I not fully blest ? 
Lisetta, pr'ythee tell the rest. 

RHYME a a *

Sure, Cloe just, and Cloe fair, 
Deserves to be your only care : 
But when you and she to-day 
Far into the wood did stray. 
And I happen'd to pass by. 
Which way did you cast your eye 
But when your cares to her you sing. 
Yet dare not tell her whence they spring ; 

RHYME a a b b b c c 

Does it not more afflict your heart, 
That in those cares she bears a part ? 
When you the flowers for Cloe twine, 
Why do you to her garland join 
The meanest bud that falls from mine ? 
Simplest of swains ! the world may see, 
Whom Cloe loves, and who loves me. 

TITLE

RHYME a b a b 

The pride of every grove I chose, 
The violet sweet, and lily fair, 
The dappled pink, and blushing; rose, 
To deck my charming Cloe's hair. 

RHYME a b a b 

At morn the nymph vouchsaFd to place 
Upon her brow the various wreath ; 
The flowers less blooming than her face. 
The scent less fragrant than her breath. 

RHYME a b a b 

The flowers she wore along the day : 
And every nymph and shepherd said, 
That in her hair they look'd more gay 
Than glowing in their native bed. 

RHYME a b a b 

Undrest at evening when she found 
Their odours lost, their colours past ; 
She chang'd her look, and on the ground 
Her garland and her eye she cast. 

RHYME a b a b 

That eye dropt sense distinct nnd clear, 
As any Muse's tongue could speak. 
When- from its lid a pearly tear 
Ran trickling; down her beauteous cheek. 

RHYME a b a b 

Dissembling' what I knew too well, 
My love, my life, said I, explain 
This change of humour : pr'ythee, tell : 
That falling tear â€” What does it mean '. 

RHYME a b a b 

She sigh'd ; she smil'd : and to the flowers 
Pointing, the lovely moralist said : 
See, friend, in some few fleeting hours, 
See yonder, what a change is made. 

RHYME a b a b 

Ah me ! the blooming pride of May, 
And that of beauty are but one : 
At morn both flourish bright and gay, 
Both fade at evening, pale, and gone. 

RHYME a b a b 

At dawn poor Stella danc'd and sung ; 
The amorous youth around her bow'd ; 
At night her fatal knell was rung ; 
I saw, and kiss'd her in her shroud. 

RHYME a b a b 

Such as she is, who died to-day, 
Such I, alas ! may be to-morrow ; 
Go, Damon, bid thy Muse display 
The justice of thy Cloe's sorrow.

RHYME a b a b 

Forbear to ask me, why I weep ; 
Vex'd Cloe to her shepherd said ; 
Tis for my two poor sti'ag-gling^ sheep 
Perhaps, or for my squirrel dead. 

RHYME a b a b 

For mind I what you late have writ '. 
Your subtle questions, and replies ; 
Emblems, to teach a female wit 
The ways, where changing Cupid flies. 

RHYME a b a b 

Your riddle purpos'd to rehearse 
The general power that beauty has ; 
But why did no peculiar verse 
Describe one charm of Cloe's face ? 

RHYME a b a b 

The glass, Avhich was at Venus' shrine, 
With such mysterious sorrow laid : 
The garland (and you call it mine) 
Which show'd how youth and beauty fade. 

RHYME a b a b 

Ten thousand trifles light as these 
Nor can my rage, nor anger move : 
She should be humble, who would please; 
And she must suffer, who can love. 

RHYME a b a b 

When in my glass I chanc'd to look ; 
Of Venus what did I implore ? 
That every grace which thence I took, 
Should know to charm my Damon more. 

RHYME a b a b 

Reading thy verse; Who heeds, said I, 
If here or there his glances flew ? 
O free for ever be his eye, 
Whose heart to me is always true. 

RHYME a b a b 

My bloom indeed, my little flower 
Of beauty quickly lost its pride ; 
For, sever'd from its native bower, 
It on thy glowing bosom died. 

RHYME a b a b 

Yet car'd I not what might presage. 
Or withering wreath, or fleeting youth ; 
Love I esteem'd more strong than age, 
And time less permanent than truth. 

RHYME a b a b 

Why then I weep, forbear to know : 
Fall uncontrolld my tears, and free : 
O Damon ! 'tis the only woe 
I ever yet conceal'd from thee. 

RHYME a b a b 

The secret wound with which I bleed 
Shall lie wrapt up, e'en in my hearse ; 
But on my tombstone thou shalt read 
My answer to thy dubious verse.

RHYME a b a b 

Yes, fairest proof of Beauty's power, 
Dear idol of my panting heart, 
Nature points this my fatal hour : 
And I have liv'd ; and we must part. 

RHYME a b a b 

While now I take my last adieu. 
Heave thou no sigh, nor shed a tear ; 
Lest yet my half-clos'd eye may view- 
On earth an object worth its care. 

RHYME a b a b 

From Jealousy's tormenting strife 
For ever be thy bosom freed : 
That nothing may disturb thy life, 
Content a  hasten to the dead. 

RHYME a b a b 

Yet when some better-fated youth 
Shall with his amorous parley move thee ; 
Reflect one moment on his truth 
AVho, dying thus, persists to love thee.

Dear Cloe, how blubber'd is that pretty face ; 
Thy cheek all on fire, and thy hair all uncurl'd: 
Pr'ythee quit this caprice ; and (as old Falstaff says) 
Let us e'en talk a little like folks of this world. 

RHYME a b a b 

How canst thou presume, thou hast leave to destroy 
The beauties, which Venus but lent to thy keeping ? 
Those looks were design'd to inspire love and joy : 
More ord'nary eyes may serve people for weeping-. 

RHYME a b a b 

To be vex'd at a trifle or two that I writ, 
Yourj udgment at once , and my passion you wrong : 
You take that for fact, which will scarce be found wit : 
Odds life ! must one swear to the truth of a song ? 

RHYME a b a b 

What I speak, my fair Cloe, and what I write, shows 
The difference there is betwixt nature and art : 
I court others in verse ; but I love thee in prose : 
And they have my whimsies, but thou hast my heart. 

RHYME a b a b 

The god of us' verse-men (you know child) the sun, 
How after his journeys he sets up his rest : 
If at morning o'er earth 'tis his fancy to run ; 
At night he declines on his Thetis's breast. 

RHYME a b a b 

So when I am wearied with wandering all day, 
To thee, my delight, in the evening I come : 
No matter what beauties I saw in ray way ; * 
They were but my visits, but thou art my home. 

RHYME a b a b 

Then finish, dear Cloe, this pastoral war; 
And let us, like Horace and Lydia, agree : 
For thou art a girl as much brighter than her, 
As he was a poet sublimer than me.

The Trojan swain had judg'd the great dispute, 
And beauty's power obtain'd the golden fruit ; 
When Venus, loose in all her naked charms, 
Met Jove's great daughter clad in shining arms. 
The wanton goddess vievv'd the warlike maid 
From head to foot, and tauntingly she said : 

RHYME a a *

My heart with her but, as guest-wise, sojourn'd ; 
And now to Helen it is lionie return'd, 

RHYME a a *

Yield, sister; rival, yield : naked, you see, 
a  vanquish : guess how potent I should be, 
If to the field I came in armour drest ; 
Dreadful, like thine, my shield, and terrible my crest! 

RHYME a a *

The warrior goddess with disdain replied : 
Thy folly, child, is equal to thy pride : 
Let a brave enemy for once advise, 
And Venus (if 'tis possible) be wise. 
Thou to be strong must put off every dress ; 
Thy only armour is thy nakedness : 
And niore than once, (or thou art much belied) 
By Mars himself that armour has been tried.

From public noise and factious strife. 
From all the busy ills of life. 
Take me, my Celia, to thy breast, 
And lull my wearied soul to rest. 
For ever, in this humble cell, 
Let thee and I, my fair one, dwell ; 

RHYME a a *

None enter else, but Love and he 
Shall bar the door, and keep the key. 
To painted roofs, and shining spires 
(Uneasy scats of high desires) 
Let the unthinking many crowd, 
That dare be covetous and proud : 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

In golden bondage let them wait, 
And barter happiness for state. 
But oh ! my Celia, when thy swain 
Desires to see a court again, 
May Heaven around this destin'd head 
The choicest of its curses shed ! 
To sum up all the rage of Fate, 
In the two things I dread and hate ; 
Mayst thou be false, and I be great ! 

RHYME a a *

Thus, on his Celia's panting breast, 
Fond Celadon his soul express'd ; 
While with delight the lovely maid 
Receiv'd the vows, she thus repaid : 
Hope of my age, joy of my youth, 
Blest miracle of love and truth ! 
All that could e'er be counted mine, 
My love and life, long since are thine : 

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

A real joy I never knew, 
Till I believ'd thy passion true : 
A real grief I ne'er can find, 
Till thou prov'st perjur'd or unkind. 
Contempt, and poverty, and care. 
All we abhor, and all we fear. 
Blest with thy presence, I can bear. 
Through waters, and through flames I'll go. 
Sufferer and solace of thy woe : 

RHYME a a *

Trace me some yet unheard-of way, 
That I thy ardour may repay ; 
And make my constant passion known, 
By more than woman yet has done. 

RHYME a a *

Had I a wish that did not bear 
The stamp and image of my dear ; 
I'd pierce my heart through every vein, 
And die to let it out again. 
No ; Venus shall my witness be, 
(If Venus ever lov'd like me) 
That for one hour I would not quit 
My shepherd's arms, and this retreat.

But soon, alas ! our pleasures pass. 
He thank'd her on his bended knee ; 
Then drank a quart of milk and tea : 
And leaving her ador'd embrace, 
Hasten'd to court to beg a place. 

RHYME a a *

While she, his absence to bemoan, 
The very moment he was gone, 
Call'd Thyrsis from beneath the bed ! 
Where all tliis time he had been hid.

While men have these ambitious fancies ;

Miss Danae, when fair and young, 
(As Horace has divinely sung) 
Could not be kept from Jove's embrace 
By doors of steel, and walls of brass. 
The reason of the thing is clear ; 
Would Jove the naked truth aver : 
Cupid was with him of the party. 
And show'd himself sincere and hearty : 

RHYME a a *

For, give that whipster but his errand, 
He takes my Lord Chief Justice' warrant;

Since this has been authentic truth, 
By age deliver'd down to youth ; 
Tell us, mistaken husband, tell us, 
Why so mysterious, why so jealous ? 
Does the restraint, the bolt, the bar 
Make us less curious, her less fair ? 
The spy, which does this treasure keep, 
Does she ne'er say her prayers, nor sleep ? 

RHYME a a *

Does she to no excess incline ? 
Does she fly music, mirth, and wine ? 
Or have not g^old and flattery power

Your care does farther yet extend : 
That spy is guarded by your friend. â€” 
But has this friend nor eye, nor heart? 
May he not feel the cruel dart, 
Which, soon or late, all mortals feel ? 
May he not, with too tender zeal. 
Give the fair pris'ner cause to see. 
How much he wishes she Avere free ?

In short, a  keep her from the sight

From pen and paper she's debarr'd. 
Has she a bodkin and a card ? 
She'll prick her mind. â€” She will you say : 
But how shall she that mind convey ? 
I keep her in one room ; I lock it ; 
The key (look here) is in this pocket.

She'll thrust her letter through â€” Sir Martin.

Dear angry friend, what must be done ? 
Is there no way ? â€” There is but one. 
Send her abroad ; and let her see, 
That all this mingled mass, which she. 
Being forbidden, longs to know, 
Is a dull farce, an empty show, 
Powder, and pocket-glass, and beau ; 
A staple of romance and lies. 
False tears, and real perjuries :

Where sighs and looks are bought and sold ; 
And love is made but to be told ; 
Where the fat bawd, and lavish heir 
The spoils of ruin'd beauty share : 
And youth, seduc'd from friends and fame, 
Must give up age to want and shame. 
Let her behold the frantic scene. 
The women wretched, false the men : 
And when, these certain ills to shun. 
She would to thy embraces run ; 
Receive her with extended arms : 
Seem more delighted with her charms : 
Wait on her to the park and play : 
Put on good humour; make her gay : 
Be to her virtues very kind ; 
Be to her faults a little blind ; 
Let all her ways be unconfin'd ; 
And clap your padlock â€” on her mind.

Hans Carvel, impotent and old, 
Married a lass of London mould : 
Handsome ? enough ; extremely gay 
Lov'd music, company, and play : 
High flights she had, and wit at will ; 
And so her tongue lay seldom still : 
For in all visits who but she, 
To argue, or to repartee ? 

RHYME a a *

She made it plain, that human passion 
Was order'd by predestination ; 
That if weak women went astray, 
Their stars were more in fault than they ; 
Who]e tragedies she had by heart ; 
Enter'd into Roxana's part : 

RHYME a a *

To triumph in her rival's blood, 
The action certainly was good. 
How like a vine young Ammon curl'd I 
Oh that deal' conqueror of the world ! 
She pitied Betterton in age. 
That ridicul'd the god-like rage. 

RHYME a a *

She, first of all the town, was told, 
Where ne^vcst India thing's were sold : 
So in a morning, without bodice, 
Slipt sometimes out to Mrs. Thody's; 
To cheapen tea, to buy a screen : 
What else could so much virtue mean ? 

RHYME a a *

For to prevent the least reproach, 
Betty went with her in the coach. 

RHYME a a *

But when no very great affair 
Excited her peculiar care. 
She without fail was wak'd at ten ; 
Drank chocolate, then slept again : 
At twelve she rose ; with much ado 
Her clothes were huddled on by two ; 
Then, does my lady dine at home ? 
Yes, sure ; â€” but is the Colonel come ? 
Next, how to spend the afternoon, 
And not come home again too soon ; 
The Change, the City, or the Play, 
As each was proper for the day : 
A turn in summer to Hyde Park, 
When it grew tolerably dark. 

RHYME a a *

Wife's pleasure causes husband's pain : 
Strange fancies come in Hans's brain : 
He thought of what he did not name ; 
And would reform, but durst not blame. 
At fii'st he therefore preacli'd his wife 
The comforts of a pious life : 
Told her how transient beauty was ; 
That all must die, and flesh was grass : 
He bought her sermons, psalms, and graces ; 
And doubled down the useful places. 
Pjut still the weight of worldly care 
Allow'd her little time for prayer : 
And Cleopatra* was read o'er, 
While Scot,* and Wake^f and twenty more, 

RHYME a a *

That teach one to deny oneself. 
Stood unmolested on the shelf. 

RHYME a a *

An untouch'd Bible grac'd her toilet : 
No fear that thumb of hers should spoil it. 

RHYME a a *

In short, the trade was still the same : 
The dame went out, the colonel came. 

RHYME a a *

What's to be done ? Poor Carvel cried : 
Another battery must be tried : 
What if to spells I had recourse ? 
'Tis but to hinder something worse. 
The end must justify the means : 
He only sins who ill intends : 
Since therefore 'tis to combat evil, 
'Tis lawful to employ the devil. 

RHYME a a *

Forthwith the devil did appear 
(For name him, and he's always near), 
Not in the shape in which he plies 
At miss's elbow when she lies ; 
Or stands before the nursery doors. 
To take the naughty boy that roars : 
But, without saucer-eye or claw, 
Like a grave barrister at law. 

RHYME a a *

Hans Carvel, lay aside your grief. 
The devil says ; I bring relief. 
Relief, says Hans : pray let me crave 
Your name, Sir, â€” Satan â€” Sir, your slave ; 

RHYME a a *

I did not look upon your feet : 
You'll pardon me : Ay, now I see't : 

RHYME a a *

And pray, Sir, when came you from hell ? 
Our friends there, did you leave them well ? 

RHYME a a *

All well ; but pr'ythee, honest Hans, 
(Says Satan) leave your complaisance : 

RHYME a a *

The truth is this : I cannot stay 
Flaring- in sunshine all the day : 

RHYME a a *

For, entre nous, we hellish sprites 
Love more the fresco of the nights ; 

RHYME a a *

And oftener our receipts convey 
In dreams, than any other way. 

RHYME a a *

I tell you therefore as a friend, 
Ere morning dawns, your fears shall end : 

RHYME a a *

Go then this evening', master Carvel,' 
Lay down your fowls, and broach your barrel ; 

RHYME a a *

Let friends and wine dissolve your care ; 
Whilst I the great receipt prepare : â€” 

RHYME a a *

To-night I'll bring it, by my faith; 
Believe for once what Satan saith. 

RHYME a a *

Away went Hans : glad ? not a little ; 
Obey'd the devil to a tittle ; 
Invited friends some half a dozen, 
The colonel and my lady's cousin. 
The meat was serv'd ; the bowls were crown'd ; 
Catches were sung ; and healths went round ; 
Barbadoes waters for the close ; 
Till Hans had fairly got his dose : 
The colonel toasted to the best : 
The Dame mov'd off, to be undiest : 
The chimes went twelve : the guests withdrew 
But wheji, or how, Hans hardly knew. 
Some modern anecdotes aver, 
He nodded in his elbow chair; 
F)om thence was carried off to bed : 
John held his heels, and Nan his head. 
My lady w'as disturb'd : new sorrow ! 
Which Hans must answer for to-morrow. 
In bed then view this happy pair ; 
And think how Hymen triumph'd there. 

RHYME a a *

Hans fast asleep as soon as laid, 
The duty of the night unpaid : 
The waking dame, with thoughts opprest. 
That made her hate both him and rest ; 
By such a husband, such a wife ! 
'Twas Acme's and Septimius' life : 
The lady sigh'd : the lover snor'd : 
The punctual devil kept his word : 
Appear 'd to honest Hans again ; 
But not at all by madam seen : 
And giving him a magic ring. 
Fit for the finger of a king" ; 
Dear Hans, said he, this jewel take, 
And wear it long for Satan's sake : 
'Twill do your business to a hair : 
For, long as you this ring shall wear, 
As sure as I look over Lincoln, 
That ne'er shall iiappen which you think on. 
Hans took the ring with joy extreme ; 
(All this was only in a dream) 

RHYME a a *

And, thrusting it beyond his joint, 
'Tis done, he cried : I've gain'd my point. â€” 
What point, said she, you ugly beast ? 
You neither give me joy nor rest : 
Tis done. â€” What's done, you drunken bear ? 
You've thrust your finger G-d knows where.

Beyond the fix'd and settled rules

Beyond the letter of the law,

Exact to rule, exempt from fault :

The Titian stroke, the Guido air; 
To nicest judgment show the piece ; 
At best 'twill only not displease :

And where will this dry moral end ? 
The truth of w^hat you here lay down

(And twenty other I forbear) 
May serve to make this thesis clear. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

A doctor of great skill and fame, 
Paulo Purganti was his name. 
Had a good, comely, virtuous wife; 
No woman led a better life : 
She to intrigues was e'en hard-hearted : 
She chuckled when a bawd was carted ; 
And thought the nation ne'er would thrive. 
Till all the Avhores were burnt alive. 

RHYME a a *

On married men, that dar'd be bad, 
She thought no mercy should be had ; 

RHYME a a *

They should be hang'd, or starv'd, or flead, 
Or serv'd Hke Romish priests in Swede. 
In short, all lewdness she defied : 
And stift' was her parochial pride. 

RHYME a a *

Yet, in an honest way, the dame 
Was a great lover of that same ; 
And could from scripture take her cue, 
That husbands should give wives their due. 

RHYME a a *

Her prudence did so justly steer 
Between the gay and the severe. 
That if in some regards she chose 
To curb poor Paulo in too close ; 
In others she relax'd again. 
And govern'd witli a looser rein. 

RHYME a a *

Thus though she strictly did confine 
The doctor from excess of wine ; 
With oysters, eggs, and vermicelli, 
She let him almost burst his belly : 
Thus drying coftee was denied ; 
But chocolate that loss supplied : 
And for tobacco (who could bear it), 
Filthy concomitant of claret ! 
(Blest revolution !) one might see 
Eringo roots, and bohea tea. 

RHYME a a *

She often set the doctor's band. 
And strok'd his beard, and squeez'd his hand 
Kindly complaiu'd, that after noon 
He went to pore on books too soon ; 
She held it wholesomer by much, 
To rest a little on the couch

RHYME a a *

About his waist in bed a-nig"hts 
She ching- so close â€” for fear of sprites. 

RHYME a a *

The Doctor undei'stood the call ; 
But had not always wherewithal. 

RHYME a a *

The lion's skin too short, you know 
(As Plutarch's Morals finely show), 
Was lengthen'd by the fox's tail ; 
And art supplies, where strength may fail. 

RHYME a a *

Unwilling- then, in arms to meet 
The enemy he could not beat ; 
He strove to lengthen the campaign, 
And save his forces by chicane. 
Fabius, the Roman chief, who thus 
By fair retreat grew Maximus, 
Shows us, that all the warrior can do 
With force inferior, is Cunctando. 

RHYME a a *

One day then, as the foe drew near, 
With love, and joy, and life, and dear ; 
Our don, who knew this tittle-tattle 
Did, sure as trumpet, call to battle : 
Thought it extremely a propos, 
To ward against the coming blow : 
To ward : but how ? Ay, there's the question ; 
Fierce the assault, unarm'd the bastion. 

RHYME a a *

The doctor feign'd a strange surprise : 
He felt her pulse ; he view'd her eyes ; 
That beat too fast, these roll'd too quick ; 
She was, he said,. or would be sick ; 
He judg'd it absolutely good, 
That she should purge and cleanse her blood. 

RHYME a a *

Spa waters for that end were got : 
If they pass'd easily or not, 
What matters it ? the lady's fever 
Continued violent as ever. 

RHYME a a *

For a distemper of this kind, 
(Blackraore* and Hanst are of my mind,) 
If once it youthful blood infects, 
And chiefly of the female sex. 
Is scarce remov'd by pill or potion ; 
Whate'er might be our doctor's notion. 

RHYME a a *

One luckless night then, as in bed 
The doctor and the dame were laid ; 
Again this cruel fever came, 
High pulse, short breath, and blood in flame. 

RHYME a b a b 

What measures shall poor Paulo keep 
With madam in this piteous taking? 
She, like Macbeth, has murder'd sleep, 
And won't allow him rest though waking. 

RHYME a a b b c c c d d 

Sad state of matters ! when we dare 
Nor ask for peace, nor ofter war ; 
Nor Livy nor Comines have shown. 
What in this juncture may be done. 
Grotius might own, that Paulo's case is 
Harder than any which he places 
Amongst his Belli and his Pacis. 
He strove, alas ! l)ut strove in vain, 
By dint of logic to maintain, 

RHYME a a *

That all the sex was born to grieve, 
Down to her ladyship from Eve. 

RHYME a a *

He rang'd his tropes, and preach'd up patience ; 
Back'd his opinion with quotations, 

RHYME a a *

Divines and moraHsts ; and run ye on 
Quite through from Seneca to Banyan.

RHYME a a *

As much in vain he bid her try 
To fold her arms, and close her eye ; 

RHYME a a *

Telling' her, rest would do her good, 
If any thing in nature could: 

RHYME a a *

So held the Greeks quite down from Galen, 
Masters and princes of their calling

RHYME a a *

So all our modern friends maintain 
(Though no great Greeks) in Warwick-lane. 

RHYME a a *

Reduce, my Muse, the wandering song: 
A tale should never be too long. 

RHYME a a *

The more he talk'd, the more she burn'd. 
And sigh'd, and toss'd, and groan'd, and turn'd : 
At last, I wish, said she, my dear 
(And whisper'd something in his ear.) 
You wish ! wish on, the doctor cries : 
Lord ! when will womankind be wise ? 
What, in youi' waters? are you mad ? 
Why poison is not half so bad. 
I'll do it but I give you warning : 
You'll die before to-morrow morning. 
'Tis kind, my dear, what you advise ; 
The lady with a sigh replies ! 
But life, you know, at best is pain ; 
And death is what we shouhl disdain. 

RHYME a a *

So do it, therefore, and adieu : 
For I will die for love of you. 
Let wanton wives by death be scar'd : 
But, to my comfort, I'm prepar'd.

So said, so done : the gods consent :

Jove made his leg, and kiss'd the dame : 
Obsequious Hermes did the same.

My destin'd miles I shall have gone, 
By Thames or Maese, by Po or Rhone, 
And found no foot of earth my own ; 
Great Mother, let me once be able 
To have a garden, house, and stable ; 
That I may read, and ride, and plant, 
Superior to desire, or want ; 

RHYME a a *

And as health fails, and years increase. 
Sit down, and think, and die in peace. 
Oblige thy favourite undertakers 
To throw me in but twenty acres : 
This number sure they may allow ; 
For ])asture ten, and ten for plow : 
'Tis all that a  Avould wish, or hope, 
For me and John, and Nell, and Crop.

Then, as thou wilt, dispose the rest 
(And let not Fortune spoil the jest) 
To those, who at the market-rate 
Can barter honour for estate 

RHYME a a *

Now if thou grant'st me my request, 
To make thy votai*y truly blest, 
Let curst revenge, and saucy pride 
To some bleak rock far off be tied ; 
Nor e'er approach my rural seat. 
To tempt me to be base and great.

And, Goddess, this kind office done, 
Charge Venus to command her son,

At once instructed and delighted

Yet for the fume of all these deeds, 
What beg'gar in the Invalides,

With lameness broke, with blindness smitten, 
Wish'd ever decently to die, 
To have been either Mezeray,

It's strange, dear author, yet it true is, 
That, down from Pharamond to Louis,

All covet life," yet call it pain : 
All feel the ill, yet shun the cure : 
Can sense this paradox endure ?

The man in g'raver tragic known 
(Though his best part long since was done)

After the jest still loads the scene 
Unwilling to retire, though weary.

Blest be the princes, who have fought 
For pompous names, or wide dominion ;

Thy humorous vein, thy pleasing- folly 
Lies all neglected, nil forgot : 
And pensive, wavering, melancholy.

RHYME a a *

In awful pomp, and melancholy state, 
â€¢See settled Reason on the judgment seat; 
Around her crowd Distrust, and Doubt, and Fear, 
And thoughtful Foresight, and tormenting Care : 
Far from the throne, the trembling Pleasures stand, 
Chain'd up, or exil'd by her stern command. 
Wretched her subjects, gloomy sits the queen ; 
Till happy Chance reverts the cruel scene : 
And apish Folly with her wild resort 
Of wit and jest disturbs the solemn court. 

RHYME a a *

See the fantastic minstrelsy advance. 
To breathe the song, and animate the dance. 
Blest the usurper! happy the surprise-! 
Her mimic postures catch our eager eyes : 
Her jingling bells affect our captive ear; 
And in the sights we see, and sounds we hear. 
Against our judgment she our sense employs; 
The laws of troubled Reason she destroys : 
And in her place rejoices to indite- 
Wild schemes of mirth, and plans of loose delight.

Forgive the Muse, who, in unhallovv'd strains, 
The Saint one moment from his God detains : 
For sure, whate'er you do, where'er you are, 
'Tis all but one good work, one constant prayer : 
Forgive her ; and intreat that God, to whom 
Thy favour'd vows with kind acceptance come, 
To raise her notes to that sublime degree. 
Which suits a song of piety and thee. 

RHYME a a *

Wondrous good man ! whose labours may repel 
The force of sin, may stop the rage of hell : 
Thou, like the Baptist, from thy God wast sent, 
The cr}'ing voice, to bid the world repent. 

RHYME a a *

The Youth shall study, and no more engage 
Their flattering wishes for uncertain age ; 
No more with fruitless care, and cheated strife, 
Chase fleeting Pleasure through this maze of life : 
Finding the wretched all they here can have, 
But present food, and but a future grave : 
Each, great as Philip's victor son, shall view 
This abject world, and weeping, ask a new. 
Decrepid Age shall read thee, and confess, 
Thy labours can assuage, where medicines cease ; 

RHYME a a b b b 

Shall bless thy words, their wounded soul's relief, 
The drops that sweeten their last dreg:s of life ; 
Shall look to Heaven, and laugh at all beneath ; 
Own riches gather'd, trouble ; fame a breath ; 
And life an ill, whose only cure is death. 

RHYME a a b b 

Thy even thoughts with so much plainness flow, 
Their sense untutor'd infancy may know :

Easy in words, thy style in sense sublime. 
On its blest steps each age and sex may rise ; 
'Tis like the ladder in the Patriarch's dream. 
Its foot on earth, its height above the skies, 
Diflus'd its virtue, boundless is its power; 
'Tis public health, and universal cure ; 
Of heavenly manna 'tis a second feast ; 
A nation's food, and all to every taste. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

To its last height mad Britain's guilt was rear'd ; 
And various death for various crimes she fear'd. 
With your kind work her drooping hopes revive ; 
You bid her read, repent, adore, and live : 
You wrest the bolt from Heaven's avenging hand ; 
Stop ready death, and save a sinking land. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

O ! save us still : still bless us with thy stay : 
O ! want thy Heaven, till we have learnt the way : 
Refuse to leave thy destin'd charge too soon : 
And for the church's good, defer thy own. 
O ! live : and let thy works urge our belief ; 
Live to e.xplain thy doctrine by thy life ; 
Till future infancy, baptiz'd by thee, 
Grow ripe in yeais, and old in piety ; 
Till Christians, yet unborn, be taug-ht to die. 

RHYME a a *

Then in full ag-e, and hoary holiness, 
Retire, great teacher ! to thy promis'd bliss : 
Untouch'd thy tomb, uninjur'd be thy dust, 
As thy own fame among the future just ; 
Till in last sounds the dreadful trumpet speaks ; 
Till Judgment calls ; and quicken'd Nature wakes: 
Till through the utmost earth, and deepest sea. 
Our scatter'd atoms find their destin'd way, 
In haste to clothe their kindred souls again, 
Perfect our state, and build immortal man : 
Then fearless thou, who well sustain'st the fight. 
To paths of joy, or tracts of endless light, 

RHYME a a a

'Midst thy own flock, great shepherd, be receiv'd ; 
And glad all Heaven with millions thou hast sav'd.

To modern wonders, and to Britain's king : 
With equal justice and historic care,

Confess the various attributes of fame 
Collected and complete in William's name :

That nothing went before so great, 
And nothing greater can succeed. 

RHYME a b a b 

Thy native Latium was thy darling care. 
Prudent in peace, and terrible in war : 
The boldest virtues that have govern'd earth 
From Lati urn's fruitful womb derive their birth.

Then turn to her fair written page ; 
From dawning childhood to establish'd age, 
The glories of her empire trace ; 
Confront the heroes of thy Roman race ; 
And let the justest palm the victor's temples grace. 
The son of Mars reduc'd the trembling swains, 
And spread his empire o'er the distant plains : 

RHYME a a b b 

But yet the Sabines' violated charms 
Obscur'd the glory of his rising arms. 
Numa the rights of strict religion knew ; 
On ever}' altar laid the incense due ;

Unskill'd to dart the pointed spear, 
Or lead the forward youth to noble war.

Stern Brutus was with too much horror good, 
Holding his fasces stain'd with filial blood.

Fabius was wise, but with excess of care 
He sav'd his country ; but prolong'd the war. 

RHYME a a *

While Decius, Paulus, Curius, greatly fought. 
And by their strict examples taught, 
How wild desires should be controlled, 
And how much brighter virtue was, than gold : 

RHYME a a *

They scarce their swelling thirst of fame could hide ; 
And boasted poverty with too much pride.

Excess in youth made Scipio less rever'd ;

Julius with honour tam'd Rome's foreign foes ; 
But patriots fell, ere the dictator rose.

With justest honour be their merits dress'd ; 
But be their failings too confess'd : 
Their virtue, like their Tyber's flood, 
Rolling its course, design'd the country's good. 

RHYME a a *

But oft the torrent's too impetuous speed 
From the low earth tore some polluting weed ; 

RHYME a a *

And with the hlood of Jove there always ran, 
Some viler part, some tincture of the man. 

RHYME a a b c b c 

Few virtues after these so far prevail, 
But that their vices more than turn the scale : 
Valour grown wild hy pride, and power by rage. 
Did the true charms of majesty impair ; 
Rome by degrees advancing more in age, 
Shew'd sad remains of what had once been fair; 

RHYME a a *

Till Heaven a better race of men supplies : 
And glory shoots new beams from western skies. 

RHYME a a *

Turn then to Pharamond, and Charlemain, 
And the long heroes of the Gallic strain ; 
Experienc'd chiefs, for hardy prowess known. 
And bloody wreaths in venturous battles won. 
From the first William, our great Nonnan king, 
The bold Plantagenets, and Tudors bring ; 
Illustrious \Trtues, who by turns have rose 
In foreign fields to check Britannia's foes ; 

RHYME a a *

With happy laws her empire to sustain, 
And with full power assert her ambient main. 
But sometimes too industrious to be great, 
Nor patient to expect the turns of fate, 
They open'd camps deform'd by civil fight. 
And made proud conquest trample over right ; 
Disparted Britain mourn'd their doubtful sway. 
And dreaded both when neither would obey.

Then see the kindred blood of Orange flow, 
From warlike Cornet, through the loins of Beau ; 
Through Chalon next, and there with Nassau join. 
From Rhone's fair banks transplanted to the Rhine. 
Bring next the royal list of Stuarts forth, 
Undaunted minds that rul'd the rugged north ;

Till Scotland's kings ascend the English throne ; 
And the fair rivals live for ever one.

Does our modern story trace, 
Finding some of Stuart's race 
Unhappy, pass their annals by : 
No harsh reflection let remembrance raise : 
Forbear to mention what thou canst not praise : 
But as thou dwell'st upon that heavenly name,* 
To grief for ever sacred, as to fame. 
Oh ! read it to thyself; in silence weep ; 
And thy convulsive sorrows inward keep ; 
Lest Britain's grief should waken at the sound ; 
And blood gush fresh froni her eternal wound.

Whither wouldst thou further look ? 
Read William's acts, and close the ample book :

With infant patience calm'd seditious strife, 
And quell'd the snakes which round his cradle ran.

When conq'ring-, mild ; when conquer'd, not disgrac'd ; 
By wrongs not lessen'd, nor by triumphs rais'd : 

RHYME a a b b b 

Superior to the blind events 
Of little human accidents ; 
And constant to his first decree. 
To curb the proud, to set the injur'd free ; 
To bow the haughty neck, and raise the suppliant knee.

His opening years to riper manhood bring ; 
And see the hero perfect in the king : 
Imperious arms by manly reason sway'd. 
And power supreme by free consent obey'd ; 
With how much haste his mercy meets his foes : 
And how unbounded his forgiveness flows ; 
With what desire he makes his subjects bless'd, 
His favours granted ere his throne address'd : 
What trophies o'er our captiv'd hearts he rears, 
By arts of peace more potent, than by wars : 
How o'er himself, as o'er the world, he reigns, 
His morals strenc-thenincr what his law ordains.

And losing not its lustre nor its weight.

Till she by William's trumpets was alarm'd,

RHYME a a *

Jove and Pallas, mighty powers, 
Guided the hero to the hostile towers. 
Perseus seem'd less swift in war,

Streams arm'd with rocks, and mountains red with fire 
In vain against his force conspire. 
Behold him from the dreadful height appear ! 
And lo ! Britannia's lions waving there. 

RHYME a a b c b c d d e e 

Europe freed, and France repell'd. 
The hero from the height beheld : 
He spake the word, that war and rage should cease : 
He bid the Maese and Rhine in safety flow ; 
And dictated a lasting peace 
To the rejoicing world below. 
To rescu'd states, and vindicated crowns, 
His equal hand prescrib'd their ancient bounds; 
Ordain'd, Avhom every province should obey; 
How far each monarch should extend his sway : 

RHYME a a *

Taught 'em how clemency made power rever'd ; 
And that the prince belov'd was truly fear'd. 
Firm by his side unspotted Honour stood, 
Pleas'd to confess him not so great as good ; 
His head with brighter beams fair Virtue deck'd. 
Than those wliich all his numerous crowns reflect: 
Establish'd Freedom clapp'd her joyful wings ; 
Proclaim'd the first of men, and best of kings.

To mind the rider's voice, or hear the reins : 
When glorious fields and opening camps he views ;

Hardly the Muse can sit the headstrong horse ; 
Nor would she, if she could, check his impetuous force ;

Views him advancing his auspicious prow ; 
Combating adverse winds and winter seas, 
Sighing the moments that defer our ease ; 
Daring to wield the sceptre's dangerous weight, 
And taking the command, to save the state ; 
Thoug'h ere the doubtful gift can be secur'd, 
New wars must be sustain'd, new wounds endur'd.

Through rough lerne's camps she sounds alarms, 
And kingdoms yet to be redeem'd by arms ; 
In the dank marshes finds her glorious theme ; 
And plunges after him thro' Boyne's fierce stream.

To tell old Ocean how the Hero past. 
The god rebukes their fear, and owns the praise 
Worthy that arm, whose empire he obeys. 

RHYME a a *

Back to his Albion she delights to bring 
The humblest victor, and the kindest king. 
Albion with open triumph would receive 
Her hero, nor obtains his leave :

Firm he rejects the altars she would raise ; 
And thanks the zeal, while he declines the praise. 
Again she follows him through Belgia's land. 
And countries often sav'd by William's hand ; 
Hears joyful nations bless those happy toils, 
Which freed the people, but return'd the spoils. 

RHYME a a *

In various views she tries her constant theme ; 
Finds him in councils, and in arms the same ;

Then with unweary wing the goddess soars 
East, over Danube and Propontis' shores ; 
Where jarring empires, ready to engage. 
Retard theii* armies, and suspend their rage ; 
Till William's word, like that of Fate, declares, 
If they shall study peace, or lengthen wars. 
How sacred his renown for equal laws, 
To whom the world defers its common cause ! 
How fair his friendships, and his leagues how just. 
Whom every nation courts, whom all religions trust !

From the Meeotis to the Northern sea, 
The goddess wings her desperate way ; 
See the young Muscovite,* the mighty head. 
Whose sovereign terror forty nations dread,

Enamour'd with a greater monarch's praise. 
And passing half the earth to his embrace :

But her own king she likens to his Thames, 
With gentle course devolving fruitful streams : 
Serene yet strong, majestic yet sedate, 
Swift without violence, without terror great. 
Each ardent nymph the rising current craves ; 
Each shepherd's prayer retards the parting waves ; 
The vales along the bank their sweets disclose : 
Fresh flowers for ever rise : and fruitful harvest grows. 

RHYME a a *

Yet whither would th' adventurous goddess go ? 
Sees she not clouds, and earth, and main below ? 
Minds she the dangers of the Lycian coast, 
And fields, whei'e mad Bellerophon was lost? 

RHYME a a b b b 

Or is her towering flight reclaim'd, 
By seas from Icarus's downfall nam'd ? 
Vain is the call, and useless the advice : 
To wise persuasion deaf, and human cries, 
Yet upwards she incessant flies ; 

RHYME a a *

Resolv'd to reach the high empyrean sphere, 
And tell great Jove, she sings his image here ; 
To ask for William an Olympic crown, 
To Chromius' strength and Theron's speed unknown : 
Till, lost in trackless fields of shining day. 
Unable to discern the way, 
Which Nassau's virtue only could explore, 
Untouch'd, unknown, to any Muse before ;

She, from the noble precipices thrown, 
Comes rushing with uncommon ruin down. 

RHYME a a b c c b b 

Glorious attempt ! unhappy fate ! 
The song too daring, and the theme too great ! 
Yet rather thus she wills to die, 
Than in continued annals live, to sing 
A second hero, or a vulgar king ; 
And with ignoble safety fly 
In sight of earth, along a middle sky. 

RHYME a b b a c d c d

That round his mystic temple press, 
For William's life, and Albion's peace. 
Ambitious Muse reduce the roving song. 
Janus, cast thy forward eye 
Future, into great Rhea's pregnant womb ; 
Where young ideas brooding lie, 
And tender images of things to come : 

RHYME a a b b b 

Till by thy high commands releas'd, 
Till by thy hand in proper atoms dress'd, 
In decent order they advance to light ; 
Yet then too swiftly fleet by human sight ; 
And meditate too soon their everlasting flight.

Can any future honours give 
To the victorious monarch's name :

Shut then, auspicious god, thy sacred gate. 
And make us happy, as our king- is great.

A more delightful leaf expand, 
Free from alarms, and fierce Bellona's rage :

By Flora some, and some by Ceres crown'd ;

From Saturn's rule, and better metal nam'd. 

RHYME a a b b b c c 

Secure by William's care let Britain stand ; 
Nor dread the bold invader's hand : 
From adverse shores in safety let her hear 
Foreign calamity, and distant war ; 
Of which let her, great Heaven, no portion bear ! 
Betwixt the nations let her hold the scale, 
And as she wills, let either part prevail :

Where the white towers and ancient roofs did stand, 
Remains of *Wolsey's, or great Henry's hand, 
To age now yielding, or devour'd by flame ; 
Let a young phenix raise her towering head ; 
Her wings with lengthen'd honour let her spread; 
And by her greatness shew her builder's fame : 
August and open, as the hero's mind, 
Be her capacious courts design'd : 

RHYME a a b c b c d d e e 

Let every sacred pillar bear 
Trophies of arms, and monuments of war. 
The king shall there in Parian marble breathe, 
His shoulder bleeding fresh : and at his feet 
Disarm'd shall lie the threatening Death : 
(For so was saving Jove's decree complete.) 
Behind, that angel shall be plac'd, whose shield 
Sav'd Europe in the blow repell'd : 
On the firm basis, from his oozy bed ; 
Boyne shall raise his laurell'd head ; 

RHYME a a b b c c 

And his immortal stream be known. 
Artfully waving through the wounded stone. 
And thou, imperial Windsor, stand enlarg'd. 
With all the monarch's trophies charg'd : 
Thou, the fair Heaven, that dost the stars inclose, 
Wliich William's bosom wears, or hand bestows 

RHYME a a 

On the great champions who support his throne, 
And virtues nearest to his own. 

RHYME a a b c b c c d d e e 

Round Ormond's knee, thou tiest the mystic string', 
That makes the knight companion to the king. 
From glorious camps return'd, and foreign fields, 
Bowing before thy sainted warrior's shrine, 
Fast by his great forefather's coats, and shields 
Blazon'd from Bohun's, or from Butler's line, 
He hangs his arms; nor fears those arms should shine 
With an unequal ray ; or that his deed 
With paler g'lory should recede, 
Eclips'd by theirs, or lessen'd by the fame 
E'en of his own maternal Nassau's name. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d d 

Thou smiling see'st great Dorset's worth confest, 
The ray distinguishing the patriot's breast : 
Born to protect and love, to help and please ; 
Sovereign of wit, and ornament of peace. 
! long as breath informs this fleeting frame, 
Ne'er let me pass in silence Dorset's name ; 
Ne'er cease to mention the continued debt. 
Which the great patron only would forget, 
And duty, long as life, must study to acquit. 

RHYME a a b b 

Renown'd in thy records shall Ca'ndish stand, 
Asserting legal power, and just command : 
To the great house thy favour shall be shown, 
The father's star transmissive to the son. 

RHYME a a *

From thee the Talbot's and the Seymour's race 
Inform'd, their sire's immortal steps shall trace : 

RHYME a a *

Happy, may their sons receive 
The bright reward, which thou alone canst give. 

RHYME a a *

And if a god these lucky numbei's guide ; 
If sure Apollo o'er the verse preside ; 

RHYME a b a b 

Jersey, belov'd by all (for all must feel 
The influence of a form and mind, 
Where comely grace and constant virtue dwell, 
Like mingled streams, more forcible when join'd)

RHYME a a *

Jersey shall at thy altars stand ; 
Shall there receive the azure band. 

RHYME a a *

That fairest mark of favour and of fame, 
Familiar to the Viliiers' name. 

RHYME a a *

Science to raise, and knowledge to enlarge. 
Be our great master's future charge; 

RHYME a a *

To wi-ite his own memoii-s, and leave his heirs 
High schemes of government, and plans of wars ; 
By fair rewards our noble youth to raise 
To emulous merit, and to thirst of praise ; 
To lead them out from ease ere opening dawn, 
Through the thick forest and the distant lawn, 
Where the fleet stag employs their ardent care. 
And chases give them images of war. 
To teach them vigilance by false alarms ; 
Inure them in feign'd camps to real arms ; 
Practise them now to curb the turning steed, 
Mocking the foe ; now to his rapid speed 
To give the rein, and in the full career, 
To draw the certain sword, or send the pointed spear. 

RHYME a a *

Let him unite his subjects' hearts, 
Planting societies for peaceful arts ; 
Some that in nature shall true knowledge found ; 
And by experiment make precept sound ; 

RHYME a a *

Some that to morals shall recall the age, 
And purge from vicious dross the sinking stage ; 
Some that with care true eloquence shall teach, 
And to just idioms fix our doubtful speech : 

RHYME a a *

That from our writers distant realms may know, 
The thanks we to our monarch owe ; 
And schools profess our tongue through eveiy land, 
That has invok'd his aid, or blest his hand. 

RHYME a a *

Let his high power the drooping Muses rear, 
The Muses only can reward his care : 
'Tis they that guard the great Atrides' spoils ; 
'Tis they that still renew Ulysses' toils : 
To them by smiling Jove 'twas given, to save 
Distinguish'd patriots from the common grave ; 
To them, great William's glory to recall, 
When statues moulder, and when arches fall. 

RHYME a a *

Nor let the Muses, with ungrateful pride. 
The sources of their treasure hide : 
The Hero's virtue does the string inspire, 
When with big joy they strike the living lyre : 

RHYME a a *

On William's fame their fate depends : 
With him the song begins : with him it ends 

RHYME a b a b 

From this bright ejc a uence of his deed 
. They borrow that reflected light, 
With which the lasting lamp they feed, 
Whose beams dispel the damps of envious night. 

RHYME a a *

Through various climes, and to each distant pole, 
In happy tides let active commerce roll : 
Let Britain's ships export an annual fleece. 
Richer than Argos brought to ancient Greece: 
Returning loaden Avith the shining stores, 
Which lie profuse on either India's shores. 
As our high vessels pass their watery way. 
Let all the naval world due homage pay ; 
With hasty reverence their top-honours lower, 
Confessing the asserted power. 

RHYME a a *

To whom by fate 'twas given, with happy sway 
To calm the earth, and vindicate the sea. 

RHYME a a *

Our prayers are heard, our masters' fleets shall go 
As far as winds can bear, or waters flow, 

RHYME a a *

New lands to make, new Indies to explore, 
In worlds unknown to plant Britannia's power ; 

RHYME a a *

Nations yet wild by precept to reclaim, 
And teach them arms, and arts, in William's name 

RHYME a a *

With humble joy, and with respectful fear 
The listening people shall his story hear, 
The wounds he bore, the dangers he sustain'd. 
How far he conquer'd, and how well he reign'd ; 

RHYME a a a 

Shall own his mercy equal to his fame. 
And form their children's accents to his name, 
Enquiring how, and when from Heaven he came. 

RHYME a a a 

Their reg-al tyrants shall with blushes hide 
Their little lusts of arbitrary pride, 
Nor bear to see their vassals tied ; 

RHYME a a b b b 

When William's virtues raise their opening* thought, 
His forty years for public freedom fought, 
Europe by his hand sustain'd, 
His conquest by his piety restrain'd, 
And o'er himself the last great triumph gain'd. 

RHYME a a a b b c c d d 

No long-er shall their wretched zeal adore 
Ideas of destructive power, 
Spirits that hurt, and godheads that devour : 
New incense they shall bring, new altars raise, 
And fill their temples with a stranger's praise ; 
When the great father's character they find 
Visibly stamp'd upon the hero's mind ; 
And own a present Deity confest, 
In valour that preserv'd, and power that blest. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

Through the large convex of the azure sky 
(For thither nature casts our common eye) 
Fierce meteors shoot their arbitrar}' light : 
And comets march with lawless horror bright : 
These hear no rule, no righteous order own ; 
Their influence dreaded as their ways unknown : 
Through threaten'd lands they wild destruction throw. 
Till ardent prayer averts the public woe : 

RHYME a a * 

But the brig-ht oi'b that blesses all above. 
The sacred fire, the real son of Jove, 
Rules not his actions by capricious will ; 
Nor by ungovern'd power declines to ill ; 
Fix'd by just laws he goes for ever right : 
Man knows his course, and thence adores his light. 
Janus ! would intreated Fate conspire 
To grant what Britain's wishes could require ; 
Above, that sun should cease his way to go, 
Ere William cease to rule, and bless below : 

RHYME a b b a c c d d 

But a relentless destiny 
Urges all that e'er was born : 
Suatch'd from her arms, Britannia once must mourn 
The demi-god : the earthly half must die. 
Yet if our incense can your wrath remove ; 
If human prayers avail on minds above ; 
Exert, great God, thy interest in the sky; 
Gain each kind Power, each guardian Deity; 

RHYME a b a b c d c d e e 

That conquer'd by the public vow. 
They bear the dismal mischief far away: 
O ! long as utmost nature may allow. 
Let them retard the threaten'd day ! 
Still be our master's life thy happy care : 
Still let his blessings with his years increase : 
To his laborious youth consum'd in war, 
Add lasting age, adorn'd and crown'd with peace : 
Let twisted olive bind those laurels fast, 
Whose verdure must for ever last ! 

RHYME a a b b b c c d d e e 

Long let this growing ei-a bless his sway : 
And let our sons his present rule obey : 
On his Sure virtue long let earth rely : 
And late let the imperial eagle fly. 
To bear the hero through his father's sky, 
To Leda's twins, or he whose glorioiis speed. 
On foot prevail'd, or he Avho tam'd the steed ; 
To Hercules, at length absolv'd by Fate 
From earthly toil, and above envy great : 
To Virgil's theme, bright Cytherea's son, 
Sire of the Latian, and the British throne : 

RHYME a a b b c b c 

To all the radiant names above, 
Rever'd by men, and dear to Jove. 
Late, Janus, let the Nassau-star, 
New-born, in rising- majesty appear, 
To triumph over vanquish'd night. 
And guide the prosperous mariner 
With everlasting beams of friendly light. 

RHYME a a *

Say, dearest Villiers, poor departed friend, 
(Since fleeting life thus suddenly must end) 
Say, what did all thy busy hopes avail, 
That anxious thou from pole to pole didst sail ; 
Ere on thy chin the springing beard began 
To spread a doubtful down, and promise man? 
What profited thy thoughts, and toils, and cares, 
In vigour more confirm'd, and riper years ? 
To wake ere morning dawn to loud alarms. 
And march till close of night in heavy arms ; 
To scorn the summer's suns and winter's snows. 
And search through ever)' clime thy country's foes ! 

RHYME a a a 

Tliat thou mig-htst Fortune to thy side engage ; 
That gentle Peace might quell Bellona's rage ; 
And Anna's bounty crown her soldier's hoaiy age? 

RHYME a a b b c c c 

In vain we think that free-will'd man has power 
To hasten or protract th' appointed hour. 
Our term of life depends not on our deed : 
Before our birth our funeral was decreed. 
Nor aw'd by foresight, nor misled by chance, 
Imperious Death directs his ebon lance ; 
Peoples great Henry's tombs, and leads up Holbein's dance. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d e e f f 

Alike must every state, and every age 
Sustain the universal tyrant's rage : 
For neither William's power, nor Marj's charms. 
Could, or repel, or pacify his arms : 
Young Churchill* fell, as life began to bloom : 
And Bradford's t trembling age expects the tomb. 
Wisdom and eloquence in vain would plead 
One moment's respite for the learned head : 
â€¢Judges of writings and of men have died ; 
Maecenas, Sackville, Socrates, and Hyde : 
And in their various turns their sons must tread 
Those gloomy journeys which their sires have led. 

RHYME a a *

The ancient sage, who did so long maintain, 
That bodies die, but souls return ag-ain, 
With all the births and deaths he had in store, 
Went out Pythagoras, and came no more. 
And modern Asgyll,* whose capricious thought 
Is yet with stores of wilder notions fraught, 
Too soon convinc'd, shall yield that fleeting-breath 
Which play'd so idly with the darts of death. 

RHYME a a *

Some from the stranded vessel force their way; 
Fearful of Fate, they meet it in the sea : 
Some who escape the fury of the wave, 
Sicken on earth, and sink into a grave : 
In journeys or at home, in war or peace. 
By hardships many, many fall by ease. 
Each changing season does its poison bring, 
Rheums chill the winter, agues blast the spring ; 

RHYME a a *

Wet, dry, cold, hot, at the appointed hour. 
All act subservient to the tyrant's power : 
And when obedient nature knows his will, 
A fly, a grapestone, or a hair can kill. 

RHYME a a b b b 

For restless Proserpine for ever treads 
In paths unseen, o'er our devoted heads ; 
And on the spacious land, and liquid main, 
Spreads slow disease, or darts afflictive pain : 
Variety of deaths confirm her endless reig'n. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

On curst Piava's banks the goddess stood, 
Shew'd her dire warrant to the rising' flood ; 
When what a  long' must love, and long must mourn, 
With fatal speed was urging his return ; 
In his dear country to disperse his care. 
And arm himself by rest for future war ; 
To chide his anxious friends' officious fears, 
And promise to their joys his elder years. 

RHYME a a b b 

Oh ! destin'd head ; and oh ! severe decree ; 
Nor native country thou, nor friend shalt see : 
Nor Avar hast thou to wage, nor year to come : 
Impending death is thine, and instant doom. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Hark ! the imperious goddess is obey'd : 
Winds murmur; snows descend; and waters spread: 
Oh ! kinsman, friend â€” Oh ! vain are all the cries 
Of human voice ; strong destiny replies : 
Weep you on earth : for he shall sleep below : 
Thence none return ; and thither all must go. 

RHYME a a *

Whoe'er thou art, whom choice or business leads 
To this sad river, or the neighbouring meads ; 
If thou mayst happen on the dreary shores 
To iind the object which this verse deplores ; 

RHYME a a b b c c c 

Cleanse the pale corpse with a relig'ious hand 
From the polluting weed and common sand ; 
Lay the dead hero graceful in a grave ; 
(The only honour he can now receive) 
And fragrant mould upon his body throw : 
And plant the warrior laurel o'er his bi'ow : 
Light lie the earth ; and flourish green the bough. 

RHYME a a b b c c d d 

So may just Heaven secure thy future life 
From forejg'n dang'ers, and domestic strife ! 
And when the infernal judge's dismal power 
From the dark urn shall throw thy destin'd hour ; 
When yielding to the sentence, breathless thou 
And pale shalt lie, as what thou buriest now ; 
May some kind friend the piteous object see, 
And equal rites perform to that whichonce was thee. 

RHYME a a b b c c 

Shine forth, ye planets, with distinguish'd light. 
As when ye hallow'd first this happy night : 
Again transmit your friendly beams to earth : 
As when Britannia joy'd for Anna's birth : 
And thou, propitious star, whose sacred power 
Presided o'er the monarch's natal hour, 

RHYME a a *

Thy radiant voyages for ever run, 
Yielding' to none but Cynthia, and the Sun : 
With thy fair aspect still illustrate Heaven : 
Kindly preserve what thou hast greatly given : 
Thy influence for thy Anna we implore ; 
Prolong one life ; and Britain asks no more : 
For Virtue can no ampler power express, 
Than to be great in war, and good in peace : 

RHYME a a *

For thought no higher wish of bliss can frame, 
Than to enjoy that virtue still the same. 
Entire and sure the monarch's rule must prove. 
Who founds her greatness on her subjects' love ; 
Who does our homage for our good require ; 
And orders that which we should first desire : 

RHYME a a a 

Our vanquish'd wills that pleasing force obey, 
Her goodness takes our liberty away. 
And haughty Britain yields to arbitrary sway. 

RHYME a a *

Let the young Austrian then her terrors bear, 
Great as he is, her delegate in war : 
Let him in thunder speak to both his Spains, 
That in these dreadful isles a woman reigns. 
While the bright queen does on her subjects shower 
The gentle blessings of her softer power ; 

RHYME a a *

Gives sacred morals to a vicious age, 
To temples zeal, and manners to the stage ; 
Bids the chaste IMuse without a blush appear ; 
And wit be that which Heaven and she may hear. 

RHYME a a *

Minerva thus to Perseus lent her shield ; 
Secure of conquest, sent him to the field : 
The hero acted what tlie queen ordain'd : 
So was his fame complete, and Andromede unchain'd.

Meantime amidst her native temples sate 
The goddess, studious of her Grecian's fate, 
Taught them in laws and letters to excel, 
In acting" justly, and in writing- well. 

RHYME a a a 

Thus whilst she did hei" various power dispose ; 
The world was freed from tyrants, Avars, and woes : 
Virtue was taught in verse, and Athens' glory rose. 

RHYME a a *

Since hir'd for life, thy servile Muse must sing 
Successive conquests, and a glorious king ; 
Must of a man immortal vainly boast, 
And bring him laurels, whatsoe'er they cost: 
What turn wilt thou employ, what colours lay 
On the event of that superior day, 
In which one English subject's prosperous hand 
(So Jove did will; so Anna did command) 
Broke the proud column of thy master's praise. 
Which sixty winters had conspir'd to raise ? 

RHYME a a b b b c c 

From the lost field a hundred standards brought 
Must be the work of Chance, and Fortune's fault : 
Bavaria's stars must be accus'd, which shone 
That fatal day the mighty work was done, 
With rays oblique upon the Gallic sun. 
Some demon envying France misled the fight ; 
And Mars mistook, though Louis order'd right. 

RHYME a a *

When thy* young Muse invok'd the tuneful Nine. 
To say how Louis did not pass the Rhine, 
What work had we with Wageninghen, Arnheim, 
Places that could not be reduc'd to rhyme ! 
And though the poet made his last efforts, 
Wurts â€” who could mention in heroic â€” Wurts ? 
But, tell me, hast thou reason to complain 
Of the rough triumphs of the last campaign ; 
The Danube rescued, and the empire sav'd, 
Say, is the majesty of verse retriev'd ? 
And would it prejudice thy softer vein. 
To sing the princes, Louis and Eugene ? 

RHYME a a *

Is it too hard in happy verse to place 
The Vans and Vanders of the Rhine and Maes ? 
Her warriors Anna sends from Tweed and Thames, 
That France may fall by more harmonious names, 
Canst thou not Hamilton or Lumley bear ? 
Would Ingoldsby or Palmes offend thy ear? 
And is there not a sound in Marlborough's name. 
Which thou, and all thy brethren ought to claim, 

AUTHOR William Shakespeare

TITLE A Lover's Complaint

RHYME a b a b b c c

From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
A plaintful story from a sistering vale,
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,
And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale, 
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,
Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
Which fortified her visage from the sun,
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw 
The carcass of beauty spent and done:
Time had not scythed all that youth begun,
Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,
Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne, 
Which on it had conceited characters,
Laundering the silken figures in the brine
That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
And often reading what contents it bears;
As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe, 
In clamours of all size, both high and low.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,
As they did battery to the spheres intend;
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend 
Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,
The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,
Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride 
For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
And true to bondage would not break from thence,
Though slackly braided in loose negligence. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

A thousand favours from a maund she drew
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
Which one by one she in a river threw,
Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
Like usury, applying wet to wet, 
Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Of folded schedules had she many a one,
Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;
Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone 
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,
With sleided silk feat and affectedly
Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.

RHYME a b a b b c c

These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes, 
And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:
Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents, 
Big discontent so breaking their contents.

RHYME a b a b b c c

A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--
Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew
Of court, of city, and had let go by
The swiftest hours, observed as they flew-- 
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,
And, privileged by age, desires to know
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.

RHYME a b a b b c c

So slides he down upon his grained bat,
And comely-distant sits he by her side; 
When he again desires her, being sat,
Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
If that from him there may be aught applied
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,
'Tis promised in the charity of age. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold
The injury of many a blasting hour,
Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:
I might as yet have been a spreading flower, 
Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied
Love to myself and to no love beside.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But, woe is me! too early I attended
A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
Of one by nature's outwards so commended, 
That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:
Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;
And when in his fair parts she did abide,
She was new lodged and newly deified.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls; 
And every light occasion of the wind
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.
What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
For on his visage was in little drawn 
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;
His phoenix down began but to appear
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear: 
Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
If best were as it was, or best without.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'His qualities were beauteous as his form,
For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free; 
Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,
When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.
His rudeness so with his authorized youth
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Well could he ride, and often men would say
'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,
What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!' 
And controversy hence a question takes,
Whether the horse by him became his deed,
Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But quickly on this side the verdict went:
His real habitude gave life and grace 
To appertainings and to ornament,
Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So on the tip of his subduing tongue
All kinds of arguments and question deep,
All replication prompt, and reason strong,
For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep, 
He had the dialect and different skill,
Catching all passions in his craft of will:

RHYME a b a b b c c

'That he did in the general bosom reign
Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,
To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain 
In personal duty, following where he haunted:
Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;
And dialogued for him what he would say,
Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Many there were that did his picture get, 
To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;
Like fools that in th' imagination set
The goodly objects which abroad they find
Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them 
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,
Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.
My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,
And was my own fee-simple, not in part, 
What with his art in youth, and youth in art,
Threw my affections in his charmed power,
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded; 
Finding myself in honour so forbid,
With safest distance I mine honour shielded:
Experience for me many bulwarks builded
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent
The destined ill she must herself assay?
Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
To put the by-past perils in her way?
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay; 
For when we rage, advice is often seen
By blunting us to make our wits more keen.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,
That we must curb it upon others' proof;
To be forbod the sweets that seem so good, 
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.
O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,' 
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;
Thought characters and words merely but art, 
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And long upon these terms I held my city,
Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,
And be not of my holy vows afraid: 
That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;
For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,
Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'All my offences that abroad you see
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind; 
Love made them not: with acture they may be,
Where neither party is nor true nor kind:
They sought their shame that so their shame did find;
And so much less of shame in me remains,
By how much of me their reproach contains. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Among the many that mine eyes have seen,
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,
Or my affection put to the smallest teen,
Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:
Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd; 
Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,
And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me 
Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
Effects of terror and dear modesty,
Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And, lo, behold these talents of their hair, 
With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,
I have received from many a several fair,
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,
With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,
And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify 
Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,
Whereto his invised properties did tend;
The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend; 
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
With objects manifold: each several stone,
With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender, 
Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,
But yield them up where I myself must render,
That is, to you, my origin and ender;
For these, of force, must your oblations be,
Since I their altar, you enpatron me. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
Take all these similes to your own command,
Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
What me your minister, for you obeys, 
Works under you; and to your audit comes
Their distract parcels in combined sums.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,
Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;
Which late her noble suit in court did shun, 
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,
To spend her living in eternal love.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave 
The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,
Playing the place which did no form receive,
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?
She that her fame so to herself contrives,
The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight, 
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:
The accident which brought me to her eye
Upon the moment did her force subdue,
And now she would the caged cloister fly: 
Religious love put out Religion's eye:
Not to be tempted, would she be immured,
And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!
The broken bosoms that to me belong 
Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
And mine I pour your ocean all among:
I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,
Must for your victory us all congest,
As compound love to physic your cold breast. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,
Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,
Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,
All vows and consecrations giving place:
O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space, 
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
For thou art all, and all things else are thine.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'When thou impressest, what are precepts worth
Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,
How coldly those impediments stand forth 
Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!
Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense, 'gainst shame,
And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,
The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,
Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;
And supplicant their sighs to you extend,
To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,
Lending soft audience to my sweet design, 
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,
Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;
Each cheek a river running from a fount 
With brinish current downward flow'd apace:
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
That flame through water which their hue encloses.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies 
In the small orb of one particular tear!
But with the inundation of the eyes
What rocky heart to water will not wear?
What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath, 
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,
Even there resolved my reason into tears;
There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears; 
Appear to him, as he to me appears,
All melting; though our drops this difference bore,
His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,
Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives, 
Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,
Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,
In either's aptness, as it best deceives,
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'That not a heart which in his level came
Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim; 
When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,
He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place, 
Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.
Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?
Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
What I should do again for such a sake.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O, that infected moisture of his eye, 
O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,
O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,
O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd, 
And new pervert a reconciled maid!'

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

When my love swears that she is made of truth,	
I do believe her, though I know she lies,	
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	
Unskilful in the world's false forgeries.	
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	
Although I know my years be past the best,	
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,	
Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.	
But wherefore says my love that she is young?	
And wherefore say not I that I am old? 	
O, love's best habit is a soothing tongue,	
And age, in love, loves not to have years told.	
Therefore I'll lie with love, and love with me,	
Since that our faults in love thus smother'd be.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, II

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair, 
That like two spirits do suggest me still;
My better angel is a man right fair,
My worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
To win me soon to hell, my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side, 
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
Wooing his purity with her fair pride.
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell:
For being both to me, both to each friend, 
I guess one angel in another's hell;
The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, III

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
'Gainst whom the world could not hold argument, 
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love; 
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;
Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,
Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
If broken, then it is no fault of mine. 
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
To break an oath, to win a paradise?

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,
Did court the lad with many a lovely look, 
Such looks as none could look but beauty's queen.
She told him stories to delight his ear;
She showed him favors to allure his eye;
To win his heart, she touch'd him here and there,--
Touches so soft still conquer chastity. 
But whether unripe years did want conceit,
Or he refused to take her figured proffer,
The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,
But smile and jest at every gentle offer:
Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward: 
He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, V

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd:
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll constant prove;
Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd. 
Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,
Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder; 
Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire:
Thine eye Jove's lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong, 
To sing heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, VI

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,
When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,
A longing tarriance for Adonis made 
Under an osier growing by a brook,
A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen:
Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
For his approach, that often there had been.
Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by, 
And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:
The sun look'd on the world with glorious eye,
Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.
He, spying her, bounced in, whereas he stood:
'O Jove,' quoth she, 'why was not I a flood!' 

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, VII

RHYME a b a b c c

Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle;
Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty;
Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle;
Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:
A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her, 
None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.

RHYME a b a b c c

Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,
Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!
How many tales to please me hath she coined,
Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing! 
Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,
Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.

RHYME a b a b c c

She burn'd with love, as straw with fire flameth;
She burn'd out love, as soon as straw outburneth;
She framed the love, and yet she foil'd the framing; 
She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.
Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?
Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, VIII

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

If music and sweet poetry agree,
As they must needs, the sister and the brother, 
Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,
Because thou lovest the one, and I the other.
Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch
Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such 
As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.
Thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound
That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;
And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd
When as himself to singing he betakes. 
One god is god of both, as poets feign;
One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, IX

RHYME a b a b c c

Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck'd, soon vaded,
Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!
Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!
Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting! 
Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,
And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.

RHYME a b a b c c

I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;
For why thou left'st me nothing in thy will:
And yet thou left'st me more than I did crave; 
For why I craved nothing of thee still:
O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,
Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.

Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her
Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him: 
She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,
And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.
'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god embraced me,'
And then she clipp'd Adonis in her arms;
'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god unlaced me,' 
As if the boy should use like loving charms;
'Even thus,' quoth she, 'he seized on my lips,'
And with her lips on his did act the seizure:
And as she fetched breath, away he skips,
And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure. 
Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,
To kiss and clip me till I run away!

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f 

Crabbed age and youth cannot live together:
Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;
Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather; 
Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.
Youth is full of sport, age's breath is short;
Youth is nimble, age is lame;
Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;
Youth is wild, and age is tame. 
Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;
O, my love, my love is young!
Age, I do defy thee: O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,
For methinks thou stay'st too long,

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, XII

RHYME a b a b c c

Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good; 
A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;
A flower that dies when first it gins to bud;
A brittle glass that's broken presently:
A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,
Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour. 

RHYME a b a b c c

And as goods lost are seld or never found,
As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
As flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground,
As broken glass no cement can redress,
So beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost, 
In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, XIII

RHYME a b a b c c

Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:
She bade good night that kept my rest away;
And daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care,
To descant on the doubts of my decay. 
'Farewell,' quoth she, 'and come again tomorrow:'
Fare well I could not, for I supp'd with sorrow.

Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,
In scorn or friendship, nill I construe whether:
'T may be, she joy'd to jest at my exile, 
'T may be, again to make me wander thither:
'Wander,' a word for shadows like myself,
As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, XIV

RHYME a b a b c c

Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise 
Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,
While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,
And wish her lays were tuned like the lark;

RHYME a b a b c c

For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty, 
And drives away dark dismal-dreaming night:
The night so pack'd, I post unto my pretty;
Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight;
Sorrow changed to solace, solace mix'd with sorrow;
For why, she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Were I with her, the night would post too soon;
But now are minutes added to the hours;
To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;
Yet not for me, shine sun to succor flowers!
Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow: 
Short, night, to-night, and length thyself tomorrow.

It was a lording's daughter, the fairest one of three,
That liked of her master as well as well might be,
Till looking on an Englishman, the fair'st that eye could see,
Her fancy fell a-turning. 

RHYME a a a b

Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight,
To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight:
To put in practise either, alas, it was a spite
Unto the silly damsel!

RHYME a a a b

But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain 
That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain,
For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:
Alas, she could not help it!

RHYME a a a b

Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day,
Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away: 
Then, lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay;
For now my song is ended.

RHYME a a *

On a day, alack the day!		
Love, whose month was ever May,		
Spied a blossom passing fair, 	
Playing in the wanton air:		
Through the velvet leaves the wind	
All unseen, gan passage find;		
That the lover, sick to death,		
Wish'd himself the heaven's breath,	
'Air,' quoth he, 'thy cheeks may blow;	
Air, would I might triumph so!		
But, alas! my hand hath sworn		
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:	
Vow, alack! for youth unmeet: 	
Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet.		
Thou for whom Jove would swear		
Juno but an Ethiope were;		
And deny himself for Jove,		
Turning mortal for thy love.'

RHYME a b a b c c

When as thine eye hath chose the dame, 
And stall'd the deer that thou shouldst strike,
Let reason rule things worthy blame,
As well as fancy partial might:
Take counsel of some wiser head,
Neither too young nor yet unwed. 

RHYME a b a b c c

What though she strive to try her strength,
And ban and brawl, and say thee nay,
Her feeble force will yield at length, 
When craft hath taught her thus to say,
'Had women been so strong as men,
In faith, you had not had it then.'

RHYME a b a b c c

And to her will frame all thy ways;
Spare not to spend, and chiefly there 
Where thy desert may merit praise,
By ringing in thy lady's ear:
The strongest castle, tower, and town,
The golden bullet beats it down.

RHYME a b a b c c

Serve always with assured trust, 
And in thy suit be humble true;
Unless thy lady prove unjust,
Press never thou to choose anew:
When time shall serve, be thou not slack
To proffer, though she put thee back. 

RHYME a b a b c c

The wiles and guiles that women work,
Dissembled with an outward show,
The tricks and toys that in them lurk,
The cock that treads them shall not know.
Have you not heard it said full oft, 
A woman's nay doth stand for nought?

RHYME a b a b c c

Think women still to strive with men,
To sin and never for to saint:
There is no heaven, by holy then,
When time with age doth them attaint. 
Were kisses all the joys in bed,
One woman would another wed.

RHYME a b a b c c

But, soft! enough, too much, I fear
Lest that my mistress hear my song,
She will not stick to round me i' the ear, 
To teach my tongue to be so long:
Yet will she blush, here be it said,
To hear her secrets so bewray'd.

Live with me, and be my love,
And we will all the pleasures prove 
That hills and valleys, dales and fields,
And all the craggy mountains yields.

RHYME a a b b

There will we sit upon the rocks,
And see the shepherds feed their flocks,
By shallow rivers, by whose falls 
Melodious birds sing madrigals.

RHYME a a b b

There will I make thee a bed of roses,
With a thousand fragrant posies,
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle. 

RHYME a a b b

A belt of straw and ivy buds,
With coral clasps and amber studs;
And if these pleasures may thee move,
Then live with me and be my love.

RHYME a a b b

If that the world and love were young,
And truth in every shepherd's tongue,
These pretty pleasures might me move
To live with thee and be thy love.

TITLE The Passionate Pilgrim, XIX

RHYME a a *

As it fell upon a day
In the merry month of May,
Sitting in a pleasant shade
Which a grove of myrtles made,
Beasts did leap, and birds did sing,
Trees did grow, and plants did spring;
Every thing did banish moan,
Save the nightingale alone:
She, poor bird, as all forlorn,
Lean'd her breast up-till a thorn
And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,
That to hear it was great pity:
'Fie, fie, fie,' now would she cry;
'Tereu, tereu!' by and by;
That to hear her so complain,
Scarce I could from tears refrain;
For her griefs, so lively shown,
Made me think upon mine own.
Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain!
None takes pity on thy pain:
Senseless trees they cannot hear thee;
Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:
King Pandion he is dead;
All thy friends are lapp'd in lead;
All thy fellow birds do sing,
Careless of thy sorrowing.
Even so, poor bird, like thee,
None alive will pity me.
Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled,
Thou and I were both beguiled.
Every one that flatters thee
Is no friend in misery.
Words are easy, like the wind;
Faithful friends are hard to find:
Every man will be thy friend
Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;
But if store of crowns be scant,
No man will supply thy want.
If that one be prodigal,
Bountiful they will him call,
And with such-like flattering,
'Pity but he were a king;'
If he be addict to vice,
Quickly him they will entice;
If to women he be bent,
They have at commandement:
But if Fortune once do frown,
Then farewell his great renown
They that fawn'd on him before
Use his company no more.
He that is thy friend indeed,
He will help thee in thy need:
If thou sorrow, he will weep;
If thou wake, he cannot sleep;
Thus of every grief in heart
He with thee doth bear a part.
These are certain signs to know
Faithful friend from flattering foe.

So they loved, as love in twain 
Had the essence but in one;
Two distincts, division none:
Number there in love was slain.

RHYME a b b a

Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
Distance, and no space was seen 
'Twixt the turtle and his queen:
But in them it were a wonder.

RHYME a b b a

So between them love did shine,
That the turtle saw his right
Flaming in the phoenix' sight; 
Either was the other's mine.

RHYME a b b a

Property was thus appalled,
That the self was not the same;
Single nature's double name
Neither two nor one was called. 

RHYME a b b a

Reason, in itself confounded,
Saw division grow together,
To themselves yet either neither,
Simple were so well compounded,

RHYME a b b a

That it cried, How true a twain 
Seemeth this concordant one!
Love hath reason, reason none,
If what parts can so remain.

RHYME a b b a

Whereupon it made this threne
To the phoenix and the dove, 
Co-supremes and stars of love,
As chorus to their tragic scene.

RHYME a a a

Beauty, truth, and rarity,
Grace in all simplicity, 
Here enclosed in cinders lie.

RHYME a a a

Death is now the phoenix' nest
And the turtle's loyal breast
To eternity doth rest,

RHYME a a a

Leaving no posterity: 
'Twas not their infirmity,
It was married chastity.

RHYME a a a

Truth may seem, but cannot be:
Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
Truth and beauty buried be. 

RHYME a a a

To this urn let those repair
That are either true or fair
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.

TITLE The Rape of Lucrece

RHYME a b a b b c c

From the besieged Ardea all in post,
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire 
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
And girdle with embracing flames the waist
Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
This bateless edge on his keen appetite; 
When Collatine unwisely did not let
To praise the clear unmatched red and white
Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,
Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,
Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
In the possession of his beauteous mate;
Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate, 
That kings might be espoused to more fame,
But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.

RHYME a b a b b c c

O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done
As is the morning's silver-melting dew 
Against the golden splendor of the sun!
An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:
Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Beauty itself doth of itself persuade 
The eyes of men without an orator;
What needeth then apologies be made,
To set forth that which is so singular?
Or why is Collatine the publisher
Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown 
From thievish ears, because it is his own?

RHYME a b a b b c c

Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty
Suggested this proud issue of a king;
For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing, 
Braving compare, disdainfully did sting
His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
That golden hap which their superiors want.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But some untimely thought did instigate
His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those: 
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old! 

RHYME a b a b b c c

When at Collatium this false lord arrived,
Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,
Within whose face beauty and virtue strived
Which of them both should underprop her fame:
When virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame; 
When beauty boasted blushes, in despite
Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But beauty, in that white intituled,
From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:
Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red, 
Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;
Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,
When shame assail'd, the red should fence the white.

RHYME a b a b b c c

This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen, 
Argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
Of either's colour was the other queen,
Proving from world's minority their right:
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
The sovereignty of either being so great, 
That oft they interchange each other's seat.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Their silent war of lilies and of roses,
Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd, 
The coward captive vanquished doth yield
To those two armies that would let him go,
Rather than triumph in so false a foe.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
The niggard prodigal that praised her so,-- 
In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
Which far exceeds his barren skill to show:
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

This earthly saint, adored by this devil,
Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer 
And reverend welcome to her princely guest,
Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:

RHYME a b a b b c c

For that he colour'd with his high estate,
Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;
That nothing in him seem'd inordinate, 
Save something too much wonder of his eye,
Which, having all, all could not satisfy;
But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,
That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But she, that never coped with stranger eyes, 
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies
Writ in the glassy margents of such books:
She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
Nor could she moralize his wanton sight, 
More than his eyes were open'd to the light.

RHYME a b a b b c c

He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
And decks with praises Collatine's high name,
Made glorious by his manly chivalry 
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:
Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,
And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Far from the purpose of his coming hither,
He makes excuses for his being there: 
No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;
Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,
Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
And in her vaulty prison stows the Day. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
Intending weariness with heavy spright;
For, after supper, long he questioned
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:
Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight; 
And every one to rest themselves betake,
Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.

RHYME a b a b b c c

As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving, 
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;
And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Those that much covet are with gain so fond, 
For what they have not, that which they possess
They scatter and unloose it from their bond,
And so, by hoping more, they have but less;
Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain, 
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The aim of all is but to nurse the life
With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;
And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,
That one for all, or all for one we gage; 
As life for honour in fell battle's rage;
Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
The death of all, and all together lost.

RHYME a b a b b c c

So that in venturing ill we leave to be
The things we are for that which we expect; 
And this ambitious foul infirmity,
In having much, torments us with defect
Of that we have: so then we do neglect
The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
Make something nothing by augmenting it. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
And for himself himself be must forsake:
Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?
When shall he think to find a stranger just, 
When he himself himself confounds, betrays
To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?

RHYME a b a b b c c

Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:
No comfortable star did lend his light, 
No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;
Now serves the season that they may surprise
The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,
While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed, 
Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;
Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;
Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;
But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
Doth too too oft betake him to retire, 
Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.

RHYME a b a b b c c

His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,
That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,
Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye; 
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,
'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,
So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
The dangers of his loathsome enterprise, 
And in his inward mind he doth debate
What following sorrow may on this arise:
Then looking scornfully, he doth despise
His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust: 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not
To darken her whose light excelleth thine:
And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
With your uncleanness that which is divine;
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine: 
Let fair humanity abhor the deed
That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
O impious act, including all foul harms! 
A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
True valour still a true respect should have;
Then my digression is so vile, so base,
That it will live engraven in my face.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive, 
And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
To cipher me how fondly I did dote;
That my posterity, shamed with the note
Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin 
To wish that I their father had not bin.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?
A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?
Or sells eternity to get a toy? 
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?

RHYME a b a b b c c

'If Collatinus dream of my intent,
Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage 
Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
This siege that hath engirt his marriage,
This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,
This dying virtue, this surviving shame,
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame? 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O, what excuse can my invention make,
When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,
Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?
The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed; 
And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
But coward-like with trembling terror die.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Had Collatinus kill'd my son or sire,
Or lain in ambush to betray my life,
Or were he not my dear friend, this desire 
Might have excuse to work upon his wife,
As in revenge or quittal of such strife:
But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known: 
Hateful it is; there is no hate in loving:
I'll beg her love; but she is own:
The worst is but denial and reproving:
My will is strong, past reason's weak removing.
Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw 
Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Thus, graceless, holds he disputation
'Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,
And with good thoughts make dispensation,
Urging the worser sense for vantage still; 
Which in a moment doth confound and kill
All pure effects, and doth so far proceed,
That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,
And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes, 
Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,
Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
First red as roses that on lawn we lay,
Then white as lawn, the roses took away. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!
Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer, 
That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,
Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?
All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses; 
Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:
Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;
And when his gaudy banner is display'd,
The coward fights and will not be dismay'd.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Then, childish fear, avaunt! debating, die! 
Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
My heart shall never countermand mine eye:
Sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage;
My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize; 
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?'

RHYME a b a b b c c

As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear
Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
Away he steals with open listening ear,
Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust; 
Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
So cross him with their opposite persuasion,
That now he vows a league, and now invasion.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Within his thought her heavenly image sits,
And in the self-same seat sits Collatine: 
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
That eye which him beholds, as more divine,
Unto a view so false will not incline;
But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,
Which once corrupted takes the worser part; 

RHYME a b a b b c c

And therein heartens up his servile powers,
Who, flatter'd by their leader's jocund show,
Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;
And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe. 
By reprobate desire thus madly led,
The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The locks between her chamber and his will,
Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
But, as they open, they all rate his ill, 
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:
The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.

RHYME a b a b b c c

As each unwilling portal yields him way, 
Through little vents and crannies of the place
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,
And blows the smoke of it into his face,
Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch, 
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:

RHYME a b a b b c c

And being lighted, by the light he spies
Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
He takes it from the rushes where it lies,
And griping it, the needle his finger pricks; 
As who should say 'This glove to wanton tricks
Is not inured; return again in haste;
Thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
He in the worst sense construes their denial: 
The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,
He takes for accidental things of trial;
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,
Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,
Till every minute pays the hour his debt. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
Pain pays the income of each precious thing; 
Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,
The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Now is he come unto the chamber-door,
That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,
Which with a yielding latch, and with no more, 
Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought.
So from himself impiety hath wrought,
That for his prey to pray he doth begin,
As if the heavens should countenance his sin.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer, 
Having solicited th' eternal power
That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
And they would stand auspicious to the hour,
Even there he starts: quoth he, 'I must deflower:
The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact, 
How can they then assist me in the act?

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!
My will is back'd with resolution:
Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
The blackest sin is clear'd with absolution; 
Against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution.
The eye of heaven is out, and misty night
Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
And with his knee the door he opens wide. 
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.
The curtains being close, about he walks,
Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
By their high treason is his heart misled; 
Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,
Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;
Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun 
To wink, being blinded with a greater light:
Whether it is that she reflects so bright,
That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;
But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

O, had they in that darksome prison died! 
Then had they seen the period of their ill;
Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,
In his clear bed might have reposed still:
But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;
And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight 
Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
Swelling on either side to want his bliss; 
Between whose hills her head entombed is:
Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,
To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet; whose perfect white 
Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,
Till they might open to adorn the day. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
O modest wantons! wanton modesty!
Showing life's triumph in the map of death,
And death's dim look in life's mortality:
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify, 
As if between them twain there were no strife,
But that life lived in death, and death in life.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew, 
And him by oath they truly honoured.
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
Who, like a foul ursurper, went about
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.

RHYME a b a b b c c

What could he see but mightily he noted? 
What did he note but strongly he desired?
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
With more than admiration he admired
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin, 
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.

RHYME a b a b b c c

As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified; 
Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:

RHYME a b a b b c c

And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting, 
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting:
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land; 
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
Left there round turrets destitute and pale.

RHYME a b a b b c c

They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
Where their dear governess and lady lies,
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset, 
And fright her with confusion of their cries:
She, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes,
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
Are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Imagine her as one in dead of night 
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking;
What terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking,
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view 
The sight which makes supposed terror true.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,
Like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes: 
Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries;
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.

RHYME a b a b b c c

His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!-- 
May feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
To make the breach and enter this sweet city. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin
To sound a parley to his heartless foe;
Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
The reason of this rash alarm to know,
Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show; 
But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
Under what colour he commits this ill.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,
That even for anger makes the lily pale,
And the red rose blush at her own disgrace, 
Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
Under that colour am I come to scale
Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide: 
Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,
Where thou with patience must my will abide;
My will that marks thee for my earth's delight,
Which I to conquer sought with all my might;
But as reproof and reason beat it dead, 
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'I see what crosses my attempt will bring;
I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
I think the honey guarded with a sting;
All this beforehand counsel comprehends: 
But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;
Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,
And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'I have debated, even in my soul,
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed; 
But nothing can affection's course control,
Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
I know repentant tears ensue the deed,
Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.' 

RHYME a b a b b c c

This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,
Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:
So under his insulting falchion lies 
Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Lucrece,' quoth he,'this night I must enjoy thee:
If thou deny, then force must work my way,
For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee: 
That done, some worthless slave of thine I'll slay,
To kill thine honour with thy life's decay;
And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,
Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So thy surviving husband shall remain 
The scornful mark of every open eye;
Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:
And thou, the author of their obloquy,
Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes, 
And sung by children in succeeding times.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend:
The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
A little harm done to a great good end
For lawful policy remains enacted. 
The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
In a pure compound; being so applied,
His venom in effect is purified.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,
Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot 
The shame that from them no device can take,
The blemish that will never be forgot;
Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot:
For marks descried in men's nativity
Are nature's faults, not their own infamy.' 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
While she, the picture of pure piety,
Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,
Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws, 
To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
In his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,
From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get, 
Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,
Hindering their present fall by this dividing;
So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally, 
While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:
Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,
A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth
No penetrable entrance to her plaining: 
Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
In the remorseless wrinkles of his face;
Her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd,
Which to her oratory adds more grace. 
She puts the period often from his place;
And midst the sentence so her accent breaks,
That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.

RHYME a b a b b c c

She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath, 
By her untimely tears, her husband's love,
By holy human law, and common troth,
By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,
That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
And stoop to honour, not to foul desire. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Quoth she, 'Reward not hospitality
With such black payment as thou hast pretended;
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
Mar not the thing that cannot be amended;
End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended; 
He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
To strike a poor unseasonable doe.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me:
Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me:
Myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me: 
Thou look'st not like deceit; do not deceive me.
My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee:
If ever man were moved with woman moans,
Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans:

RHYME a b a b b c c

'All which together, like a troubled ocean, 
Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,
To soften it with their continual motion;
For stones dissolved to water do convert.
O, if no harder than a stone thou art,
Melt at my tears, and be compassionate! 
Soft pity enters at an iron gate.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
To all the host of heaven I complain me,
Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name. 
Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,
Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
For kings like gods should govern everything.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,
When thus thy vices bud before thy spring! 
If in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,
What darest thou not when once thou art a king?
O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing
From vassal actors can be wiped away;
Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'This deed will make thee only loved for fear;
But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,
When they in thee the like offences prove:
If but for fear of this, thy will remove; 
For princes are the glass, the school, the book,
Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?
Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern 
Authority for sin, warrant for blame,
To privilege dishonour in thy name?
Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
And makest fair reputation but a bawd.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee, 
From a pure heart command thy rebel will:
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,
For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,
When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say, 
He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Think but how vile a spectacle it were,
To view thy present trespass in another.
Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;
Their own transgressions partially they smother: 
This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.
O, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,
Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier: 
I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:
His true respect will prison false desire,
And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,
That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine.' 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Have done,' quoth he: 'my uncontrolled tide
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.
Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,
And with the wind in greater fury fret:
The petty streams that pay a daily debt 
To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;
And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning, 
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,
Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave; 
Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave:
Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride:
The lesser thing should not the greater hide;
The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot, 
But low shrubs wither at the cedar's root.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--
No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:
Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,
Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee; 
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee
Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

This said, he sets his foot upon the light,
For light and lust are deadly enemies: 
Shame folded up in blind concealing night,
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.
The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;
Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold: 

RHYME a b a b b c c

For with the nightly linen that she wears
He pens her piteous clamours in her head;
Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed! 
The spots whereof could weeping purify,
Her tears should drop on them perpetually.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,
And he hath won what he would lose again:
This forced league doth force a further strife; 
This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
This hot desire converts to cold disdain:
Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk, 
Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
The prey wherein by nature they delight;
So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night:
His taste delicious, in digestion souring, 
Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.

RHYME a b a b b c c

O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
Can comprehend in still imagination!
Drunken Desire must vomit his receipt,
Ere he can see his own abomination. 
While Lust is in his pride, no exclamation
Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,
Till like a jade Self-will himself doth tire.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace, 
Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,
Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:
The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,
For there it revels; and when that decays,
The guilty rebel for remission prays. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,
Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
For now against himself he sounds this doom,
That through the length of times he stands disgraced:
Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced; 
To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,
To ask the spotted princess how she fares.

RHYME a b a b b c c

She says, her subjects with foul insurrection
Have batter'd down her consecrated wall,
And by their mortal fault brought in subjection 
Her immortality, and made her thrall
To living death and pain perpetual:
Which in her prescience she controlled still,
But her foresight could not forestall their will.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth, 
A captive victor that hath lost in gain;
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,
The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.
She bears the load of lust he left behind, 
And he the burden of a guilty mind.

RHYME a b a b b c c

He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
He scowls and hates himself for his offence;
She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear; 
He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;
She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;
He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight.

RHYME a b a b b c c

He thence departs a heavy convertite;
She there remains a hopeless castaway; 
He in his speed looks for the morning light;
She prays she never may behold the day,
'For day,' quoth she, 'nights scapes doth open lay,
And my true eyes have never practised how
To cloak offences with a cunning brow. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'They think not but that every eye can see
The same disgrace which they themselves behold;
And therefore would they still in darkness be,
To have their unseen sin remain untold;
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold, 
And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here she exclaims against repose and rest,
And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.
She wakes her heart by beating on her breast, 
And bids it leap from thence, where it may find
Some purer chest to close so pure a mind.
Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
Against the unseen secrecy of night:

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O comfort-killing Night, image of hell! 
Dim register and notary of shame!
Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!
Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!
Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!
Grim cave of death! whispering conspirator 
With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O hateful, vaporous, and foggy Night!
Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,
Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light,
Make war against proportion'd course of time; 
Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,
Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'With rotten damps ravish the morning air;
Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick 
The life of purity, the supreme fair,
Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
That in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
May set at noon and make perpetual night. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Were Tarquin Night, as he is but Night's child,
The silver-shining queen he would distain;
Her twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,
Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:
So should I have co-partners in my pain; 
And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,
As palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Where now I have no one to blush with me,
To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,
To mask their brows and hide their infamy; 
But I alone alone must sit and pine,
Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,
Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,
Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O Night, thou furnace of foul-reeking smoke, 
Let not the jealous Day behold that face
Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace!
Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
That all the faults which in thy reign are made 
May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!
The light will show, character'd in my brow,
The story of sweet chastity's decay,
The impious breach of holy wedlock vow: 
Yea the illiterate, that know not how
To cipher what is writ in learned books,
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,
And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name; 
The orator, to deck his oratory,
Will couple my reproach to Tarquin's shame;
Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
Will tie the hearers to attend each line,
How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Let my good name, that senseless reputation,
For Collatine's dear love be kept unspotted:
If that be made a theme for disputation,
The branches of another root are rotted,
And undeserved reproach to him allotted 
That is as clear from this attaint of mine
As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O unseen shame! invisible disgrace!
O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face, 
And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
How he in peace is wounded, not in war.
Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,
Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me, 
From me by strong assault it is bereft.
My honour lost, and I, a drone-like bee,
Have no perfection of my summer left,
But robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft:
In thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept, 
And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Yet am I guilty of thy honour's wrack;
Yet for thy honour did I entertain him;
Coming from thee, I could not put him back,
For it had been dishonour to disdain him: 
Besides, of weariness he did complain him,
And talk'd of virtue: O unlook'd-for evil,
When virtue is profaned in such a devil!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?
Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests? 
Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?
Or kings be breakers of their own behests?
But no perfection is so absolute,
That some impurity doth not pollute. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'The aged man that coffers-up his gold
Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,
But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,
And useless barns the harvest of his wits; 
Having no other pleasure of his gain
But torment that it cannot cure his pain.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,
And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
Who in their pride do presently abuse it: 
Their father was too weak, and they too strong,
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.
The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
Even in the moment that we call them ours.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring; 
Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;
The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;
What virtue breeds iniquity devours:
We have no good that we can say is ours,
But ill-annexed Opportunity 
Or kills his life or else his quality.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!
'Tis thou that executest the traitor's treason:
Thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;
Whoever plots the sin, thou 'point'st the season; 
'Tis thou that spurn'st at right, at law, at reason;
And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,
Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thou makest the vestal violate her oath;
Thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd; 
Thou smother'st honesty, thou murder'st troth;
Thou foul abettor! thou notorious bawd!
Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,
Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief! 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,
Thy private feasting to a public fast,
Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,
Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:
Thy violent vanities can never last. 
How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?

RHYME a b a b b c c

'When wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend,
And bring him where his suit may be obtain'd?
When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end? 
Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd?
Give physic to the sick, ease to the pain'd?
The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;
But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'The patient dies while the physician sleeps; 
The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
Justice is feasting while the widow weeps;
Advice is sporting while infection breeds:
Thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds:
Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder's rages, 
Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'When Truth and Virtue have to do with thee,
A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid:
They buy thy help; but Sin ne'er gives a fee,
He gratis comes; and thou art well appaid 
As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
My Collatine would else have come to me
When Tarquin did, but he was stay'd by thee.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
Guilty of perjury and subornation, 
Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
Guilty of incest, that abomination;
An accessary by thine inclination
To all sins past, and all that are to come,
From the creation to the general doom. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly Night,
Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,
Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;
Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are: 
O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!
Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Why hath thy servant, Opportunity,
Betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose,
Cancell'd my fortunes, and enchained me 
To endless date of never-ending woes?
Time's office is to fine the hate of foes;
To eat up errors by opinion bred,
Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Time's glory is to calm contending kings, 
To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
To stamp the seal of time in aged things,
To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
To wrong the wronger till he render right,
To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours, 
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;

RHYME a b a b b c c

'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,
To feed oblivion with decay of things,
To blot old books and alter their contents,
To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings, 
To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,
To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,
And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;

RHYME a b a b b c c

'To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,
To make the child a man, the man a child, 
To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,
To tame the unicorn and lion wild,
To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,
To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,
And waste huge stones with little water drops. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,
Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
One poor retiring minute in an age
Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,
Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends: 
O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,
I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,
With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight:
Devise extremes beyond extremity, 
To make him curse this cursed crimeful night:
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;
And the dire thought of his committed evil
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances, 
Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,
To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
And let mild women to him lose their mildness, 
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Let him have time to tear his curled hair,
Let him have time against himself to rave,
Let him have time of Time's help to despair,
Let him have time to live a loathed slave, 
Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
And time to see one that by alms doth live
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Let him have time to see his friends his foes,
And merry fools to mock at him resort; 
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
His time of folly and his time of sport;
And ever let his unrecalling crime
Have time to wail th' abusing of his time. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,
Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
At his own shadow let the thief run mad,
Himself himself seek every hour to kill!
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill; 
For who so base would such an office have
As slanderous death's-man to so base a slave?

RHYME a b a b b c c

'The baser is he, coming from a king,
To shame his hope with deeds degenerate:
The mightier man, the mightier is the thing 
That makes him honour'd, or begets him hate;
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
The moon being clouded presently is miss'd,
But little stars may hide them when they list.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire, 
And unperceived fly with the filth away;
But if the like the snow-white swan desire,
The stain upon his silver down will stay.
Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day:
Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly, 
But eagles gazed upon with every eye.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools!
Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!
Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;
Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters; 
To trembling clients be you mediators:
For me, I force not argument a straw,
Since that my case is past the help of law.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'In vain I rail at Opportunity,
At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night; 
In vain I cavil with mine infamy,
In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
The remedy indeed to do me good
Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Poor hand, why quiver'st thou at this decree?
Honour thyself to rid me of this shame:
For if I die, my honour lives in thee;
But if I live, thou livest in my defame:
Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame, 
And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,
To find some desperate instrument of death:
But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth 
To make more vent for passage of her breath;
Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth
As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'In vain,' quoth she, 'I live, and seek in vain 
Some happy mean to end a hapless life.
I fear'd by Tarquin's falchion to be slain,
Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife:
But when I fear'd I was a loyal wife:
So am I now: O no, that cannot be; 
Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,
And therefore now I need not fear to die.
To clear this spot by death, at least I give
A badge of fame to slander's livery; 
A dying life to living infamy:
Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know
The stained taste of violated troth; 
I will not wrong thy true affection so,
To flatter thee with an infringed oath;
This bastard graff shall never come to growth:
He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
That thou art doting father of his fruit. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,
Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.
For me, I am the mistress of my fate, 
And with my trespass never will dispense,
Till life to death acquit my forced offence.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'I will not poison thee with my attaint,
Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;
My sable ground of sin I will not paint, 
To hide the truth of this false night's abuses:
My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,
As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

By this, lamenting Philomel had ended 
The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,
And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:
But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see, 
And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Revealing day through every cranny spies,
And seems to point her out where she sits weeping;
To whom she sobbing speaks: 'O eye of eyes,
Why pry'st thou through my window? leave thy peeping: 
Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping:
Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,
For day hath nought to do what's done by night.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Thus cavils she with every thing she sees:
True grief is fond and testy as a child, 
Who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees:
Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
Continuance tames the one; the other wild,
Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,
With too much labour drowns for want of skill. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,
Holds disputation with each thing she views,
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
No object but her passion's strength renews;
And as one shifts, another straight ensues: 
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The little birds that tune their morning's joy
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy; 
Sad souls are slain in merry company;
Grief best is pleased with grief's society:
True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
When with like semblance it is sympathized.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore; 
He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows; 
Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'You mocking-birds,' quoth she, 'your tunes entomb
Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,
And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests; 
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Come, Philomel, that sing'st of ravishment,
Make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair: 
As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,
So I at each sad strain will strain a tear,
And with deep groans the diapason bear;
For burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still,
While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part,
To keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,
To imitate thee well, against my heart
Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye;
Who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die. 
These means, as frets upon an instrument,
Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And for, poor bird, thou sing'st not in the day,
As shaming any eye should thee behold,
Some dark deep desert, seated from the way, 
That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,
Will we find out; and there we will unfold
To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze, 
Wildly determining which way to fly,
Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
That cannot tread the way out readily;
So with herself is she in mutiny,
To live or die which of the twain were better, 
When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'To kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack, what were it,
But with my body my poor soul's pollution?
They that lose half with greater patience bear it
Than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion. 
That mother tries a merciless conclusion
Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,
Will slay the other and be nurse to none.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'My body or my soul, which was the dearer,
When the one pure, the other made divine? 
Whose love of either to myself was nearer,
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,
His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Her house is sack'd, her quiet interrupted,
Her mansion batter'd by the enemy;
Her sacred temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted,
Grossly engirt with daring infamy:
Then let it not be call'd impiety, 
If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole
Through which I may convey this troubled soul.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Yet die I will not till my Collatine
Have heard the cause of my untimely death;
That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine, 
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,
Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,
And as his due writ in my testament.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'My honour I'll bequeath unto the knife 
That wounds my body so dishonoured.
'Tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life;
The one will live, the other being dead:
So of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred;
For in my death I murder shameful scorn: 
My shame so dead, mine honour is new-born.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,
What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
By whose example thou revenged mayest be. 
How Tarquin must be used, read it in me:
Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,
And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'This brief abridgement of my will I make:
My soul and body to the skies and ground; 
My resolution, husband, do thou take;
Mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound;
My shame be his that did my fame confound;
And all my fame that lives disbursed be
To those that live, and think no shame of me. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.
Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:' 
Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:
Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

This Plot of death when sadly she had laid,
And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,
With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid, 
Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
Poor Lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow, 
With soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,
For why her face wore sorrow's livery;
But durst not ask of her audaciously
Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so, 
Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy 
Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.

RHYME a b a b b c c

A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,
Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling: 
One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
No cause, but company, of her drops spilling:
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing;
Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

For men have marble, women waxen, minds,
And therefore are they form'd as marble will;
The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds
Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:
Then call them not the authors of their ill, 
No more than wax shall be accounted evil
Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,
Lays open all the little worms that creep;
In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain 
Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:
Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,
Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.

RHYME a b a b b c c

No man inveigh against the wither'd flower, 
But chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd:
Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,
Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild
Poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd
With men's abuses: those proud lords, to blame, 
Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,
Assail'd by night with circumstances strong
Of present death, and shame that might ensue
By that her death, to do her husband wrong: 
Such danger to resistance did belong,
That dying fear through all her body spread;
And who cannot abuse a body dead?

RHYME a b a b b c c

By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak
To the poor counterfeit of her complaining: 
'My girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break
Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are raining?
If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,
Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood: 
If tears could help, mine own would do me good.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But tell me, girl, when went'--and there she stay'd
Till after a deep groan--'Tarquin from hence?'
'Madam, ere I was up,' replied the maid,
'The more to blame my sluggard negligence: 
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
Myself was stirring ere the break of day,
And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,
She would request to know your heaviness.' 
'O, peace!' quoth Lucrece: 'if it should be told,
The repetition cannot make it less;
For more it is than I can well express:
And that deep torture may be call'd a hell
When more is felt than one hath power to tell. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen:
Yet save that labour, for I have them here.
What should I say? One of my husband's men
Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear
A letter to my lord, my love, my dear; 
Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,
First hovering o'er the paper with her quill:
Conceit and grief an eager combat fight; 
What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill:
Much like a press of people at a door,
Throng her inventions, which shall go before.

RHYME a b a b b c c

At last she thus begins: 'Thou worthy lord 
Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,
Health to thy person! next vouchsafe t' afford--
If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see--
Some present speed to come and visit me.
So, I commend me from our house in grief: 
My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
By this short schedule Collatine may know
Her grief, but not her grief's true quality: 
She dares not thereof make discovery,
Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Besides, the life and feeling of her passion
She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her: 
When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her
From that suspicion which the world might bear her.
To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter
With words, till action might become them better. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

To see sad sights moves more than hear them told;
For then eye interprets to the ear
The heavy motion that it doth behold,
When every part a part of woe doth bear.
'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear: 
Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ
'At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.'
The post attends, and she delivers it, 
Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
As lagging fowls before the northern blast:
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
Extremity still urgeth such extremes.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The homely villain court'sies to her low; 
And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye
Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
Imagine every eye beholds their blame; 
For Lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame:

RHYME a b a b b c c

When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
Such harmless creatures have a true respect
To talk in deeds, while others saucily 
Promise more speed, but do it leisurely:
Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.

RHYME a b a b b c c

His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
That two red fires in both their faces blazed; 
She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

But long she thinks till he return again,
And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
The weary time she cannot entertain,
For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan:
So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan, 
That she her plaints a little while doth stay,
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.

RHYME a b a b b c c

At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
Before the which is drawn the power of Greece. 
For Helen's rape the city to destroy,
Threatening cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
Which the conceited painter drew so proud,
As heaven, it seem'd, to kiss the turrets bow'd.

RHYME a b a b b c c

A thousand lamentable objects there, 
In scorn of nature, art gave lifeless life:
Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:
The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;
And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights, 
Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.

RHYME a b a b b c c

There might you see the labouring pioner
Begrimed with sweat, and smeared all with dust;
And from the towers of Troy there would appear
The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust, 
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
Such sweet observance in this work was had,
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.

RHYME a b a b c c

In great commanders grace and majesty
You might behold, triumphing in their faces; 
In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;
Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces;
Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,
That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.

RHYME a b a b b c c

In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art 
Of physiognomy might one behold!
The face of either cipher'd either's heart;
Their face their manners most expressly told:
In Ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd;
But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent 
Show'd deep regard and smiling government.

RHYME a b a b b c c

There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
As 'twere encouraging the Greeks to fight;
Making such sober action with his hand,
That it beguiled attention, charm'd the sight: 
In speech, it seem'd, his beard, all silver white,
Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly
Thin winding breath, which purl'd up to the sky.

RHYME a b a b b c c

About him were a press of gaping faces,
Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice; 
All jointly listening, but with several graces,
As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
His nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear;
Here one being throng'd bears back, all boll'n and red;
Another smother'd seems to pelt and swear;
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear, 
As, but for loss of Nestor's golden words,
It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.

RHYME a b a b b c c

For much imaginary work was there;
Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,
That for Achilles' image stood his spear, 
Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,
Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:
A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,
Stood for the whole to be imagined.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy 
When their brave hope, bold Hector, march'd to field,
Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy
To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
And to their hope they such odd action yield,
That through their light joy seemed to appear, 
Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,
To Simois' reedy banks the red blood ran,
Whose waves to imitate the battle sought
With swelling ridges; and their ranks began 
To break upon the galled shore, and than
Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.

RHYME a b a b b c c

To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
To find a face where all distress is stell'd. 
Many she sees where cares have carved some,
But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,
Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,
Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,
Which bleeding under Pyrrhus' proud foot lies. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

In her the painter had anatomized
Time's ruin, beauty's wreck, and grim care's reign:
Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
Of what she was no semblance did remain:
Her blue blood changed to black in every vein, 
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,
Show'd life imprison'd in a body dead.

RHYME a b a b b c c

On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
And shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes,
Who nothing wants to answer her but cries, 
And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:
The painter was no god to lend her those;
And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,
To give her so much grief and not a tongue.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Poor instrument,' quoth she,'without a sound, 
I'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue;
And drop sweet balm in Priam's painted wound,
And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong;
And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long;
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes 
Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Show me the strumpet that began this stir,
That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur
This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear: 
Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here;
And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,
The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Why should the private pleasure of some one
Become the public plague of many moe? 
Let sin, alone committed, light alone
Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:
For one's offence why should so many fall,
To plague a private sin in general? 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,
Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds,
Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,
And one man's lust these many lives confounds: 
Had doting Priam cheque'd his son's desire,
Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,
Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes; 
Then little strength rings out the doleful knell:
So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell
To pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow;
She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.

RHYME a b a b b c c

She throws her eyes about the painting round, 
And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament.
At last she sees a wretched image bound,
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:
His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;
Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes, 
So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.

RHYME a b a b b c c

In him the painter labour'd with his skill
To hide deceit, and give the harmless show
An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,
A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe; 
Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so
That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But, like a constant and confirmed devil,
He entertain'd a show so seeming just, 
And therein so ensconced his secret evil,
That jealousy itself could not mistrust
False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

The well-skill'd workman this mild image drew
For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story
The credulous old Priam after slew;
Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry, 
And little stars shot from their fixed places,
When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.

RHYME a b a b b c c

This picture she advisedly perused,
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,
Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused; 
So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill:
And still on him she gazed; and gazing still,
Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,
That she concludes the picture was belied.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'It cannot be,' quoth she,'that so much guile'-- 
She would have said 'can lurk in such a look;'
But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while,
And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:
'It cannot be' she in that sense forsook,
And turn'd it thus,' It cannot be, I find, 
But such a face should bear a wicked mind.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'For even as subtle Sinon here is painted.
So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
As if with grief or travail he had fainted,
To me came Tarquin armed; so beguiled 
With outward honesty, but yet defiled
With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish,
So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,
To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds! 
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds:
His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;
Those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,
Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell;
These contraries such unity do hold,
Only to flatter fools and make them bold: 
So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails, 
Comparing him to that unhappy guest
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest:
At last she smilingly with this gives o'er;
'Fool, fool!' quoth she, 'his wounds will not be sore.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow, 
And time doth weary time with her complaining.
She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,
And both she thinks too long with her remaining:
Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining:
Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps, 
And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,
That she with painted images hath spent;
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
By deep surmise of others' detriment; 
Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
To think their dolour others have endured.

RHYME a b a b b c c

But now the mindful messenger, come back,
Brings home his lord and other company; 
Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:
And round about her tear-stained eye
Blue circles stream'd; like rainbows in the sky:
These water-galls in her dim element
Foretell new storms to those already spent. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
Amazedly in her sad face he stares:
Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.
He hath no power to ask her how she fares: 
Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,
Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.

RHYME a b a b b c c

At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,
And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event
Hath thee befall'n, that thou dost trembling stand? 
Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,
And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire, 
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
At length address'd to answer his desire,
She modestly prepares to let them know
Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;
While Collatine and his consorted lords 
With sad attention long to hear her words.

RHYME a b a b b c c

And now this pale swan in her watery nest
Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending;
'Few words,' quoth she, 'Shall fit the trespass best,
Where no excuse can give the fault amending: 
In me moe woes than words are now depending;
And my laments would be drawn out too long,
To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Then be this all the task it hath to say
Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed 
A stranger came, and on that pillow lay
Where thou was wont to rest thy weary head;
And what wrong else may be imagined
By foul enforcement might be done to me,
From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,
With shining falchion in my chamber came
A creeping creature, with a flaming light,
And softly cried 'Awake, thou Roman dame,
And entertain my love; else lasting shame 
On thee and thine this night I will inflict,
If thou my love's desire do contradict.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'For some hard-favour'd groom of thine,' quoth he,
'Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,
I'll murder straight, and then I'll slaughter thee 
And swear I found you where you did fulfil
The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill
The lechers in their deed: this act will be
My fame and thy perpetual infamy.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

'With this, I did begin to start and cry; 
And then against my heart he sets his sword,
Swearing, unless I took all patiently,
I should not live to speak another word;
So should my shame still rest upon record,
And never be forgot in mighty Rome 
Th' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
And far the weaker with so strong a fear:
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
No rightful plea might plead for justice there: 
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
That my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes;
And when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!
Or at the least this refuge let me find; 
Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
That was not forced; that never was inclined
To accessary yieldings, but still pure
Doth in her poison'd closet yet endure.' 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
With head declined, and voice damm'd up with woe,
With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
The grief away that stops his answer so: 
But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;
What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.

RHYME a b a b b c c

As through an arch the violent roaring tide
Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride 
Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
In rage sent out, recall'd in rage, being past:
Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw,
To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth, 
And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
'Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
More feeling-painful: let it then suffice 
To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,
Thine, mine, his own: suppose thou dost defend me 
From what is past: the help that thou shalt lend me
Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;
For sparing justice feeds iniquity.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'But ere I name him, you fair lords,' quoth she,
Speaking to those that came with Collatine, 
'Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,
With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;
For 'tis a meritorious fair design
To chase injustice with revengeful arms:
Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies' harms.' 

RHYME a b a b b c c

At this request, with noble disposition
Each present lord began to promise aid,
As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.
But she, that yet her sad task hath not said, 
The protestation stops. 'O, speak, ' quoth she,
'How may this forced stain be wiped from me?

RHYME a b a b b c c

'What is the quality of mine offence,
Being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance?
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense, 
My low-declined honour to advance?
May any terms acquit me from this chance?
The poison'd fountain clears itself again;
And why not I from this compelled stain?'

RHYME a b a b b c c

With this, they all at once began to say, 
Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
While with a joyless smile she turns away
The face, that map which deep impression bears
Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living, 
By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;
Till after many accents and delays, 
Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,
That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed: 
That blow did that it from the deep unrest
Of that polluted prison where it breathed:
Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly
Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,
Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;
Till Lucrece' father, that beholds her bleed,
Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;
And from the purple fountain Brutus drew 
The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,
Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;

RHYME a b a b b c c

And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide
In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood
Circles her body in on every side, 
Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood
Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,
And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.

RHYME a b a b b c c

About the mourning and congealed face 
Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,
Corrupted blood some watery token shows;
And blood untainted still doth red abide, 
Blushing at that which is so putrified.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,
'That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
If in the child the father's image lies,
Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived? 
Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
If children predecease progenitors,
We are their offspring, and they none of ours.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Poor broken glass, I often did behold
In thy sweet semblance my old age new born; 
But now that fresh fair mirror, dim and old,
Shows me a bare-boned death by time out-worn:
O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
And shivered all the beauty of my glass,
That I no more can see what once I was! 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,
If they surcease to be that should survive.
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
And leave the faltering feeble souls alive?
The old bees die, the young possess their hive: 
Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see
Thy father die, and not thy father thee!

RHYME a b a b b c c

By this, starts Collatine as from a dream,
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
And then in key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream 
He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,
And counterfeits to die with her a space;
Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
And live to be revenged on her death.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The deep vexation of his inward soul 
Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,
Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart's aid, 
That no man could distinguish what he said.

RHYME a b a b b c c

Yet sometime 'Tarquin' was pronounced plain,
But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.
This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,
Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more; 
At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:
Then son and father weep with equal strife
Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.

RHYME a b a b b c c

The one doth call her his, the other his,
Yet neither may possess the claim they lay. 
The father says 'She's mine.' 'O, mine she is,'
Replies her husband: 'do not take away
My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say
He weeps for her, for she was only mine,
And only must be wail'd by Collatine.' 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'O,' quoth Lucretius,' I did give that life
Which she too early and too late hath spill'd.'
'Woe, woe,' quoth Collatine, 'she was my wife,
I owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath kill'd.'
'My daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours fill'd 
The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece' life,
Answer'd their cries, 'my daughter' and 'my wife.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,
Seeing such emulation in their woe,
Began to clothe his wit in state and pride, 
Burying in Lucrece' wound his folly's show.
He with the Romans was esteemed so
As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,
For sportive words and uttering foolish things:

RHYME a b a b b c c

But now he throws that shallow habit by, 
Wherein deep policy did him disguise;
And arm'd his long-hid wits advisedly,
To cheque the tears in Collatinus' eyes.
'Thou wronged lord of Rome,' quoth be, 'arise:
Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool, 
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?
Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow
For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds? 
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
In such relenting dew of lamentations; 
But kneel with me and help to bear thy part,
To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,
That they will suffer these abominations,
Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased. 

RHYME a b a b b c c

'Now, by the Capitol that we adore,
And by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd,
By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's store,
By all our country rights in Rome maintain'd,
And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complain'd 
Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,
We will revenge the death of this true wife.'

RHYME a b a b b c c

This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,
And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;
And to his protestation urged the rest, 
Who, wondering at him, did his words allow:
Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow;
And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,
He doth again repeat, and that they swore.

RHYME a b a b b c c

When they had sworn to this advised doom, 
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,
And so to publish Tarquin's foul offence:
Which being done with speedy diligence,
The Romans plausibly did give consent 
To Tarquin's everlasting banishment.

TITLE Venus and Adonis

RHYME a b a b c c

Even as the sun with purple-colour'd face
Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,
Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;
Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;
Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him, 
And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Thrice-fairer than myself,' thus she began,
'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
More white and red than doves or roses are; 
Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,
And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;
If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed 
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:
Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,
And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;

RHYME a b a b c c

'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,
But rather famish them amid their plenty, 
Making them red and pale with fresh variety,
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:
A summer's day will seem an hour but short,
Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'

RHYME a b a b c c

With this she seizeth on his sweating palm, 
The precedent of pith and livelihood,
And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,
Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force
Courageously to pluck him from his horse. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,
Under her other was the tender boy,
Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,
With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;
She red and hot as coals of glowing fire, 
He red for shame, but frosty in desire.

RHYME a b a b c c

The studded bridle on a ragged bough
Nimbly she fastens:--O, how quick is love!--
The steed is stalled up, and even now
To tie the rider she begins to prove: 
Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,
And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.

RHYME a b a b c c

So soon was she along as he was down,
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown, 
And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;
And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,
'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'

RHYME a b a b c c

He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks; 
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:
He saith she is immodest, blames her 'miss;
What follows more she murders with a kiss.

RHYME a b a b c c

Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast, 
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,
Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;
Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,
And where she ends she doth anew begin. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Forced to content, but never to obey,
Panting he lies and breatheth in her face;
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;
Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers, 
So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.

RHYME a b a b c c

Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,
So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;
Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes: 
Rain added to a river that is rank
Perforce will force it overflow the bank.

RHYME a b a b c c

Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets, 
'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:
Being red, she loves him best; and being white,
Her best is better'd with a more delight.

RHYME a b a b c c

Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
And by her fair immortal hand she swears, 
From his soft bosom never to remove,
Till he take truce with her contending tears,
Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.

RHYME a b a b c c

Upon this promise did he raise his chin, 
Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,
Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;
So offers he to give what she did crave;
But when her lips were ready for his pay,
He winks, and turns his lips another way. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Never did passenger in summer's heat
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:
'O, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy! 
'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?

RHYME a b a b c c

'I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,
Even by the stern and direful god of war,
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,
Who conquers where he comes in every jar; 
Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Over my altars hath he hung his lance,
His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,
And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance, 
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,
Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,
Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Thus he that overruled I oversway'd,
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain: 
Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.
O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!

RHYME a b a b c c

'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,-- 
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red--
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.
What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:
Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;
Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes? 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,
And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;
Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:
These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean 
Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.

RHYME a b a b c c

'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip
Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted:
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
Beauty within itself should not be wasted: 
Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
Rot and consume themselves in little time.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,
Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold, 
Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,
Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee
But having no defects, why dost abhor me?

RHYME a b a b c c

'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;
Mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning: 
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;
My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,
Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear, 
Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:
Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be 
That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?

RHYME a b a b c c

'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,
Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft. 
Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,
Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear: 
Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;
Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed? 
By law of nature thou art bound to breed,
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;
And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,
In that thy likeness still is left alive.'

RHYME a b a b c c

By this the love-sick queen began to sweat, 
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,
And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat,
With burning eye did hotly overlook them;
Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,
So he were like him and by Venus' side. 

RHYME a b a b c c

And now Adonis, with a lazy spright,
And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,
His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,
Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie, no more of love! 
The sun doth burn my face: I must remove.'

RHYME a b a b c c

'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind?
What bare excuses makest thou to be gone!
I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun: 
I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;
If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.

RHYME a b a b c c

'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,
And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:
The heat I have from thence doth little harm, 
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;
And were I not immortal, life were done
Between this heavenly and earthly sun.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,
Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth? 
Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel
What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?
O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,
She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.

RHYME a b a b c c

'What am I, that thou shouldst contemn me this? 
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,
And one for interest, if thou wilt have twain. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,
Well-painted idol, image dun and dead,
Statue contenting but the eye alone,
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!
Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion, 
For men will kiss even by their own direction.'

RHYME a b a b c c

This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;
Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause: 
And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,
And now her sobs do her intendments break.

RHYME a b a b c c

Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,
Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;
Sometimes her arms infold him like a band: 
She would, he will not in her arms be bound;
And when from thence he struggles to be gone,
She locks her lily fingers one in one.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here
Within the circuit of this ivory pale, 
I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:
Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,
Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.

RHYME a b a b c c

Within this limit is relief enough, 
Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain
Then be my deer, since I am such a park;
No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.' 

RHYME a b a b c c

At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:
Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,
He might be buried in a tomb so simple;
Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie, 
Why, there Love lived and there he could not die.

RHYME a b a b c c

These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,
Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?
Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking? 
Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!

RHYME a b a b c c

Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?
Her words are done, her woes are more increasing;
The time is spent, her object will away, 
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.
'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'
Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.

RHYME a b a b c c

But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,
A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud, 
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:
The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,
Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.

RHYME a b a b c c

Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds, 
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,
Controlling what he was controlled with. 

RHYME a b a b c c

His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:
His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire, 
Shows his hot courage and his high desire.

RHYME a b a b c c

Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,
With gentle majesty and modest pride;
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried, 
And this I do to captivate the eye
Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'

RHYME a b a b c c

What recketh he his rider's angry stir,
His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?
What cares he now for curb or pricking spur? 
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?
He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.

RHYME a b a b c c

Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed, 
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
As if the dead the living should exceed;
So did this horse excel a common one
In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.

RHYME a b a b c c

Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long, 
Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
Save a proud rider on so proud a back. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
To bid the wind a base he now prepares,
And whether he run or fly they know not whether;
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings, 
Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.

RHYME a b a b c c

He looks upon his love and neighs unto her;
She answers him as if she knew his mind:
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind, 
Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
Beating his kind embracements with her heels.

RHYME a b a b c c

Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent: 
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
His love, perceiving how he is enraged,
Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.

RHYME a b a b c c

His testy master goeth about to take him;
When, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear, 
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
With her the horse, and left Adonis there:
As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,
Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.

RHYME a b a b c c

All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits, 
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:
And now the happy season once more fits,
That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;
For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong
When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue. 

RHYME a b a b c c

An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:
So of concealed sorrow may be said;
Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;
But when the heart's attorney once is mute, 
The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.

RHYME a b a b c c

He sees her coming, and begins to glow,
Even as a dying coal revives with wind,
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind, 
Taking no notice that she is so nigh,
For all askance he holds her in his eye.

RHYME a b a b c c

O, what a sight it was, wistly to view
How she came stealing to the wayward boy!
To note the fighting conflict of her hue, 
How white and red each other did destroy!
But now her cheek was pale, and by and by
It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.

RHYME a b a b c c

Now was she just before him as he sat,
And like a lowly lover down she kneels; 
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:
His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,
As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.

RHYME a b a b c c

O, what a war of looks was then between them! 
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;
His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;
Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:
And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Full gently now she takes him by the hand,
A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,
Or ivory in an alabaster band;
So white a friend engirts so white a foe:
This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling, 
Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.

RHYME a b a b c c

Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
'O fairest mover on this mortal round,
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound; 
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!

RHYME a b a b c c

'Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'
'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it:
O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it, 
And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:
Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,
Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'

RHYME a b a b c c

'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;
My day's delight is past, my horse is gone, 
And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:
I pray you hence, and leave me here alone;
For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,
Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'

RHYME a b a b c c

Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should, 
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:
Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;
Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:
The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,
Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!
But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,
He held such petty bondage in disdain;
Throwing the base thong from his bending crest, 
Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
His other agents aim at like delight? 
Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold
To touch the fire, the weather being cold?

RHYME a b a b c c

'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,
To take advantage on presented joy; 
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;
O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,
And once made perfect, never lost again.'

RHYME a b a b c c

I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it; 
'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;
My love to love is love but to disgrace it;
For I have heard it is a life in death,
That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd? 
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?
If springing things be any jot diminish'd,
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:
The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:
Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery; 
For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'

RHYME a b a b c c

'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?
O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!
Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
I had my load before, now press'd with bearing: 
Melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,
Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love
That inward beauty and invisible;
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move 
Each part in me that were but sensible:
Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,
Yet should I be in love by touching thee.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,
And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, 
And nothing but the very smell were left me,
Yet would my love to thee be still as much;
For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by smelling. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'But, O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,
Being nurse and feeder of the other four!
Would they not wish the feast might ever last,
And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,
Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest, 
Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'

RHYME a b a b c c

Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,
Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd
Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field, 
Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.

RHYME a b a b c c

This ill presage advisedly she marketh:
Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,
Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh, 
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,
Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,
His meaning struck her ere his words begun.

RHYME a b a b c c

And at his look she flatly falleth down,
For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth; 
A smile recures the wounding of a frown;
But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!
The silly boy, believing she is dead,
Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;

RHYME a b a b c c

And all amazed brake off his late intent, 
For sharply he did think to reprehend her,
Which cunning love did wittily prevent:
Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!
For on the grass she lies as she were slain,
Till his breath breatheth life in her again. 

RHYME a b a b c c

He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:
He kisses her; and she, by her good will, 
Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.

RHYME a b a b c c

The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:
Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,
Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array
He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth; 
And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,
So is her face illumined with her eye;

RHYME a b a b c c

Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,
As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.
Were never four such lamps together mix'd, 
Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,
Shone like the moon in water seen by night.

RHYME a b a b c c

'O, where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,
Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire? 
What hour is this? or morn or weary even?
Do I delight to die, or life desire?
But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;
But now I died, and death was lively joy.

RHYME a b a b c c

'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again: 
Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,
Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;
And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!
O, never let their crimson liveries wear!
And as they last, their verdure still endure,
To drive infection from the dangerous year!
That the star-gazers, having writ on death, 
May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,
What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?
To sell myself I can be well contented,
So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing; 
Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.

RHYME a b a b c c

'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.
What is ten hundred touches unto thee? 
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?
Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,
Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?

RHYME a b a b c c

'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years: 
Before I know myself, seek not to know me;
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:
The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait, 
His day's hot task hath ended in the west;
The owl, night's herald, shrieks, 'Tis very late;'
The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,
And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light
Do summon us to part and bid good night. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;
If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'
'Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'
The honey fee of parting tender'd is:
Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace; 
Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.

RHYME a b a b c c

Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew
The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,
Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,
Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth: 
He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth
Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.

RHYME a b a b c c

Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,
And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;
Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey, 
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;
Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,
That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry:

RHYME a b a b c c

And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,
With blindfold fury she begins to forage; 
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,
Planting oblivion, beating reason back,
Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.

RHYME a b a b c c

Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing, 
Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,
Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,
Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,
He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,
While she takes all she can, not all she listeth. 

RHYME a b a b c c

What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,
And yields at last to every light impression?
Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,
Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:
Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward, 
But then woos best when most his choice is froward.

RHYME a b a b c c

When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,
Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;
What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd: 
Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,
Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.

RHYME a b a b c c

For pity now she can no more detain him;
The poor fool prays her that he may depart:
She is resolved no longer to restrain him; 
Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,
The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,
He carries thence incaged in his breast.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch. 
Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?
Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'
He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends
To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.

RHYME a b a b c c

'The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale, 
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,
Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:
She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
He on her belly falls, she on her back. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Now is she in the very lists of love,
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:
All is imaginary she doth prove,
He will not manage her, although he mount her;
That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy, 
To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.

RHYME a b a b c c

Even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,
Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,
As those poor birds that helpless berries saw. 
The warm effects which she in him finds missing
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.

RHYME a b a b c c

But all in vain; good queen, it will not be:
She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee; 
She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.
'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;
You have no reason to withhold me so.'

RHYME a b a b c c

'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,
But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar. 
O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is
With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,
Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,
Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.

RHYME a b a b c c

'On his bow-back he hath a battle set 
Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;
His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;
His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,
And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,
Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;
His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;
Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:
The thorny brambles and embracing bushes, 
As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,
To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;
Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,
Whose full perfection all the world amazes; 
But having thee at vantage,--wondrous dread!--
Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.

RHYME a b a b c c

'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;
Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:
Come not within his danger by thy will; 
They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.
When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,
I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?
Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye? 
Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright?
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,
My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,
But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.

RHYME a b a b c c

'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy 
Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;
Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,
And in a peaceful hour doth cry 'Kill, kill!'
Distempering gentle Love in his desire,
As air and water do abate the fire. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,
This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,
This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,
That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,
Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear 
That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:

RHYME a b a b c c

'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye
The picture of an angry-chafing boar,
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore; 
Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.

RHYME a b a b c c

'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,
That tremble at the imagination?
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed, 
And fear doth teach it divination:
I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,
If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.

RHYME a b a b c c

'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare, 
Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,
Or at the roe which no encounter dare:
Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy hounds. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
How he outruns the wind and with what care
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
The many musets through the which he goes 
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell, 
And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:
Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:

RHYME a b a b c c

'For there his smell with others being mingled,
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled 
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,
As if another chase were in the skies.

RHYME a b a b c c

'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear, 
To harken if his foes pursue him still:
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
And now his grief may be compared well
To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch 
Turn, and return, indenting with the way;
Each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
For misery is trodden on by many,
And being low never relieved by any. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Lie quietly, and hear a little more;
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,
Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,
Applying this to that, and so to so; 
For love can comment upon every woe.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he,
'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:
The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.
'I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends; 
And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'
'In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all

RHYME a b a b c c

'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this,
The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
And all is but to rob thee of a kiss. 
Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,
Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:
Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine, 
Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,
For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;
Wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite,
To shame the sun by day and her by night.

RHYME a b a b c c

'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies 
To cross the curious workmanship of nature,
To mingle beauty with infirmities,
And pure perfection with impure defeature,
Making it subject to the tyranny
Of mad mischances and much misery; 

RHYME a b a b c c

'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,
Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,
The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood:
Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair, 
Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.

RHYME a b a b c c

'And not the least of all these maladies
But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:
Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,
Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder, 
Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,
As mountain-snow melts with the midday sun.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,
That on the earth would breed a scarcity 
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,
Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night
Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.

RHYME a b a b c c

'What is thy body but a swallowing grave,
Seeming to bury that posterity 
Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,
If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?
If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,
Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.

RHYME a b a b c c

'So in thyself thyself art made away; 
A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,
Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,
Or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life.
Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,
But gold that's put to use more gold begets.' 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Nay, then,' quoth Adon, 'you will fall again
Into your idle over-handled theme:
The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,
And all in vain you strive against the stream;
For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse, 
Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.

RHYME a b a b c c

'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,
And every tongue more moving than your own,
Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown 
For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,
And will not let a false sound enter there;

RHYME a b a b c c

'Lest the deceiving harmony should run
Into the quiet closure of my breast;
And then my little heart were quite undone, 
In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.
No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.

RHYME a b a b c c

'What have you urged that I cannot reprove?
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger: 
I hate not love, but your device in love,
That lends embracements unto every stranger.
You do it for increase: O strange excuse,
When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!

RHYME a b a b c c

'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled, 
Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;
Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,
As caterpillars do the tender leaves. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,
But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;
Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,
Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;
Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies; 
Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.

RHYME a b a b c c

'More I could tell, but more I dare not say;
The text is old, the orator too green.
Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;
My face is full of shame, my heart of teen: 
Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,
Do burn themselves for having so offended.'

RHYME a b a b c c

With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace; 
Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.
Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,
So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.

RHYME a b a b c c

Which after him she darts, as one on shore
Gazing upon a late-embarked friend, 
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:
So did the merciless and pitchy night
Fold in the object that did feed her sight.

RHYME a b a b c c

Whereat amazed, as one that unaware 
Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,
Even so confounded in the dark she lay,
Having lost the fair discovery of her way. 

RHYME a b a b c c

And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,
That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,
Make verbal repetition of her moans;
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:
'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'Woe, woe!' 
And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.

RHYME a b a b c c

She marking them begins a wailing note
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty: 
Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
And still the choir of echoes answer so.

RHYME a b a b c c

Her song was tedious and outwore the night,
For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:
If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight 
In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:
Their copious stories oftentimes begun
End without audience and are never done.

RHYME a b a b c c

For who hath she to spend the night withal
But idle sounds resembling parasites, 
Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,
Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?
She says 'Tis so:' they answer all 'Tis so;'
And would say after her, if she said 'No.'

RHYME a b a b c c

Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest, 
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
The sun ariseth in his majesty;
Who doth the world so gloriously behold
That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:
'O thou clear god, and patron of all light,
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,
There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother, 
May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'

RHYME a b a b c c

This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,
And yet she hears no tidings of her love:
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn: 
Anon she hears them chant it lustily,
And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.

RHYME a b a b c c

And as she runs, the bushes in the way
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay: 
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.

RHYME a b a b c c

By this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;
Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder 
Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.

RHYME a b a b c c

For now she knows it is no gentle chase, 
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,
Because the cry remaineth in one place,
Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:
Finding their enemy to be so curst,
They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first. 

RHYME a b a b c c

This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,
Through which it enters to surprise her heart;
Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:
Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield, 
They basely fly and dare not stay the field.

RHYME a b a b c c

Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;
Till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,
She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,
And childish error, that they are afraid; 
Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:--
And with that word she spied the hunted boar,

RHYME a b a b c c

Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,
A second fear through all her sinews spread, 
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:
This way runs, and now she will no further,
But back retires to rate the boar for murther.

RHYME a b a b c c

A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;
She treads the path that she untreads again; 
Her more than haste is mated with delays,
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,
Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;
In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.

RHYME a b a b c c

Here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound, 
And asks the weary caitiff for his master,
And there another licking of his wound,
'Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;
And here she meets another sadly scowling,
To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling. 

RHYME a b a b c c

When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,
Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,
Against the welkin volleys out his voice;
Another and another answer him,
Clapping their proud tails to the ground below, 
Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.

RHYME a b a b c c

Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
At apparitions, signs and prodigies,
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies; 
So she at these sad signs draws up her breath
And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,
Hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she Death,--
'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean 
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set
Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?

RHYME a b a b c c

'If he be dead,--O no, it cannot be,
Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:-- 
O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,
But hatefully at random dost thou hit.
Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart
Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke, 
And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.
The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:
Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,
And not Death's ebon dart, to strike dead. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour, 
Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'

RHYME a b a b c c

Here overcome, as one full of despair,
She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
In the sweet channel of her bosom dropt; 
But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,
And with his strong course opens them again.

RHYME a b a b c c

O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!
Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;
Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow, 
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,
Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.

RHYME a b a b c c

Variable passions throng her constant woe,
As striving who should best become her grief; 
All entertain'd, each passion labours so,
That every present sorrow seemeth chief,
But none is best: then join they all together,
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.

RHYME a b a b c c

By this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo; 
A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well:
The dire imagination she did follow
This sound of hope doth labour to expel;
For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,
And flatters her it is Adonis' voice. 

RHYME a b a b c c

Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,
Being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;
Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,
Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,
To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground, 
Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.

RHYME a b a b c c

O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
Not to believe, and yet too credulous!
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous: 
The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,
In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.

RHYME a b a b c c

Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;
It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught: 
Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
Imperious supreme of all mortal things.

RHYME a b a b c c

'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;
Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear 
When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,
Which knows no pity, but is still severe;
Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess,--
I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue; 
Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;
'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;
I did but act, he's author of thy slander:
Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet
Could rule them both without ten women's wit.' 

RHYME a b a b c c

Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;
And that his beauty may the better thrive,
With Death she humbly doth insinuate;
Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories 
His victories, his triumphs and his glories.

RHYME a b a b c c

'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I
To be of such a weak and silly mind
To wail his death who lives and must not die
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind! 
For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear
As one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;
Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear, 
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'
Even at this word she hears a merry horn,
Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.

RHYME a b a b c c

As falcon to the lure, away she flies;
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light; 
And in her haste unfortunately spies
The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;
Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,
Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;

RHYME a b a b c c

Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit, 
Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,
And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,
Long after fearing to creep forth again;
So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled
Into the deep dark cabins of her head: 

RHYME a b a b c c

Where they resign their office and their light
To the disposing of her troubled brain;
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,
And never wound the heart with looks again;
Who like a king perplexed in his throne, 
By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,

RHYME a b a b c c

Whereat each tributary subject quakes;
As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,
Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,
Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound. 
This mutiny each part doth so surprise
That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;

RHYME a b a b c c

And, being open'd, threw unwilling light
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white 
With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:
No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,
But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.

RHYME a b a b c c

This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth;
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head; 
Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:
Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;
Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.

RHYME a b a b c c

Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly, 
That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;
And then she reprehends her mangling eye,
That makes more gashes where no breach should be:
His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;
For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,
And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,
Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:
Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire! 
So shall I die by drops of hot desire.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!
What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?
Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
Of things long since, or any thing ensuing? 
The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!
Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:
Having no fair to lose, you need not fear; 
The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you:
But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air
Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:

RHYME a b a b c c

'And therefore would he put his bonnet on,
Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep; 
The wind would blow it off and, being gone,
Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
And straight, in pity of his tender years,
They both would strive who first should dry his tears.

RHYME a b a b c c

'To see his face the lion walk'd along 
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;
To recreate himself when he hath sung,
The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;
If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey
And never fright the silly lamb that day. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'When he beheld his shadow in the brook,
The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,
That some would sing, some other in their bills
Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries; 
He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.

RHYME a b a b c c

'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,
Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,
Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;
Witness the entertainment that he gave: 
If he did see his face, why then I know
He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,
Who did not whet his teeth at him again, 
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;
And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine
Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,
With kissing him I should have kill'd him first; 
But he is dead, and never did he bless
My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'
With this, she falleth in the place she stood,
And stains her face with his congealed blood.

RHYME a b a b c c

She looks upon his lips, and they are pale; 
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;
She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,
As if they heard the woeful words she told;
She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,
Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies; 

RHYME a b a b c c

Two glasses, where herself herself beheld
A thousand times, and now no more reflect;
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,
And every beauty robb'd of his effect:
'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite, 
That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy:
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:
It shall be waited on with jealousy,
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end, 
Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,
That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.

RHYME a b a b c c

'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,
Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;
The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd 
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:
The strongest body shall it make most weak,
Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.

RHYME a b a b c c

'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures; 
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;
It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,
Make the young old, the old become a child.

RHYME a b a b c c

'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear; 
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
It shall be merciful and too severe,
And most deceiving when it seems most just;
Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,
Put fear to valour, courage to the coward. 

RHYME a b a b c c

'It shall be cause of war and dire events,
And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;
Subject and servile to all discontents,
As dry combustious matter is to fire:
Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy, 
They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'

RHYME a b a b c c

By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,
And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,
A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white, 
Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.

RHYME a b a b c c

She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,
Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,
And says, within her bosom it shall dwell, 
Since he himself is reft from her by death:
She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears
Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise--
Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire-- 
For every little grief to wet his eyes:
To grow unto himself was his desire,
And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good
To wither in my breast as in his blood.

RHYME a b a b c c

'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast; 
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:
Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:
There shall not be one minute in an hour
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.' 

RHYME a b a b c c

Thus weary of the world, away she hies,
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies
In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;
Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen 
Means to immure herself and not be seen.

who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

is it for fear to wet a widows eye
that thou consumest thyself in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beautys waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murderous shame commits

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

for shame deny that thou bearst love to any
who for thyself art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovest is most evident
for thou art so possessd with murderous hate
that gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thyself at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowd she gave the more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silverd oer with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summers green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o that you were yourself but love you are
no longer yours than you yourself here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
yourself again after yourselfs decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winters day
and barren rage of deaths eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

not from the stars do i my judgment pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truths and beautys doom and date

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and chequed even by the self same sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this times pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live yourself in eyes of men
to give away yourself keeps yourself still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filld with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces
so should my papers yellowd with their age
be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termd a poets rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summers lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or natures changing course untrimmd
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

devouring time blunt thou the lions paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
and burn the long lived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
and do whateer thou wilt swift footed time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beautys pattern to succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

a womans face with natures own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a womans gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
much steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure
mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

so is it not with me as with that muse
stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
with aprils first born flowers and all things rare
that heavens air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mothers child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixd in heavens air
let them say more than like of hearsay well
i will not praise that purpose not to sell

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee times furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for myself but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gavest me thine not to give back again

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put besides his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of loves rite
and in mine own loves strength seem to decay
oercharged with burden of mine own loves might
o let my books be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressd
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld
thy beautys form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is the painters art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast where through the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlookd for joy in that i honour most
great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the suns eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foild
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toild
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tatterd loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear repose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when bodys works expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my souls imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for myself no quiet find

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarrd the benefit of rest
when days oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressd
and each though enemies to eithers reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please them thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swart complexiond night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make griefs strength seem stronger

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possessd
desiring this mans art and that mans scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear times waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
and weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe
and moan the expense of many a vanishd sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell oer
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restored and sorrows end

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all loves loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

if thou survive my well contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bettering of the time
and though they be outstrippd by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
had my friends muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style ill read his for his love

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendor on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath maskd him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds oertake me in my way
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offences cross
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
myself corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and gainst myself a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not loves sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thyself dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is t but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservest alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear loves wrong than hates known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

those petty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
and chide try beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
but heres the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadows form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend times leisure with my moan
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of eithers woe

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these present absent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy
until lifes composition be recured
by those swift messengers returnd from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad
i send them back again and straight grow sad

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to cide this title is impanneled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
and my hearts right thy inward love of heart

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famishd for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my loves picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my hearts guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thyself away art resent still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not lockd up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
calld to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against myself uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travels end
doth teach that ease and that repose to say
thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
for that same groan doth put this in my mind
my grief lies onward and my joy behind

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfectst love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee ill run and give him leave to go

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in the long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprisond pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lackd to hope

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helens cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summers breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwood and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall fade my verse distills your truth

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
gainst death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that yourself arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but to day by feeding is allayd
to morrow sharpend in his former might
so love be thou although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
to morrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
else call it winter which being full of care
makes summers welcome thrice more wishd more rare

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the world without end hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do any thing he thinks no ill

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand the account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
the imprisond absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of self doing crime
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amiss
the second burden of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd
crooked elipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beautys brow
feeds on the rarities of natures truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenor of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for myself mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me myself indeed
beated and choppd with tannd antiquity
mine own self love quite contrary i read
self so self loving were iniquity
tis thee myself that for myself i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

against my love shall be as i am now
with times injurious hand crushd and oer worn
when hours have draind his blood and filld his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelld on to ages steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now hes king
are vanishing or vanishd out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding ages cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when i have seen by times fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down razed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality oer sways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summers honey breath hold out
against the wreckful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmd in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and guilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tongue tied by authority
and folly doctor like controlling skill
and simple truth miscalld simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeing of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggard of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had
in days long since before these last so bad

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before the bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beautys dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament itself and true
making no summer of anothers green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
the solve is this that thou dost common grow

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slanders mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wood of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou presentst a pure unstained prime
thou hast passd by the ambush of young days
either not assaild or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

no longer mourn for me when i am dead
then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan
and mock you with me after i am gone

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
deaths second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourishd by
this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretchs knife
too base of thee to be remembered
the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweet seasond showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then betterd that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new found methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
for as the sun is daily new and old
so is my love still telling what is told

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
the vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
times thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory can not contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed deliverd from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learneds wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decayd
and my sick muse doth give another place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wreckd i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away
the worst was this my love was my decay

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall oer read
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
you still shall live such virtue hath my pen
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy true telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
the barren tender of a poets debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unletterd clerk still cry amen
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polishd form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say tis so tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others for the breath of words respect
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filld up his line
then lackd i matter that enfeebled mine

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou knowst thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgment making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against myself ill fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults conceald wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to myself i do
doing thee vantage double vantage me
such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right myself will bear all wrong

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
for thee against myself ill vow debate
for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an after loss
ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquerd woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortunes might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their bodies force
some in their garments though new fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments cost
of more delight than hawks or horses be
and having thee of all mens pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretched make

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

but do thy worst to steal thyself away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die
but whats so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so loves face
may still seem love to me though alterd new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in manys looks the false hearts history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
and husband natures riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summers flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beautys veil doth cover every blot
and all things turn to fair that eyes can see
take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteemd
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deemd
how many lambs might the stem wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old decembers bareness every where
and yet this time removed was summers time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowd wombs after their lords decease
yet this abundant issue seemd to me
but hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winters near

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

from you have i been absent in the spring
when proud pied april dressd in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summers story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lilys white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemd it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play

RHYME a b a b a c d c d e f e f g g

the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my loves breath the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stoln of both
and to his robbery had annexd thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make times spoils despised every where
give my love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
truth needs no colour with his colour fixd
beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
but best is best if never intermixd
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

my love is strengthend though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owners tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summers front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beautys summer dead

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

let not my love be calld idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love to day to morrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument
fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressd
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they lookd but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
for we which now behold these present days
had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme
while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

whats in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
whats new to speak what new to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say oer the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallowd thy fair name
so that eternal love in loves fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemd my flame to qualify
as easy might i from myself depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reignd
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be staind
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

alas tis true i have gone here and there
and made myself a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have lookd on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most most loving breast

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyers hand
pity me then and wish i were renewd
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you oer green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others voices that my adders sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformedst creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

or whether doth my mind being crownd with you
drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
otis the first tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
if it be poisond tis the lesser sin
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose milliond accidents
creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
divert strong minds to the course of altering things
alas why fearing of times tyranny
might i not then say now i love you best
when i was certain oer incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worths unknown although his height be taken
loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickles compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakend hate
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

like as to make our appetites more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being tuff of your neer cloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so fell sick of you

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilld from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw myself to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruind love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours youve passd a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have rememberd
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tenderd
the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

tis better to be vile than vile esteemd
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deemd
not by our feeling but by others seeing
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full characterd with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be missd
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wondering at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd
as subject to times love or to times hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of short numberd hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
to this i witness call the fools of time
which die for goodness who have lived for crime

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

were t aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which prove more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mixd with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou subornd informer a true soul
when most impeachd stands least in thy control

RHYME a a *

o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein showst
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
her audit though delayd answerd must be
and her quietus is to render thee

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beautys name
but now is black beautys successive heir
and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on natures power
fairing the foul with arts false borrowd face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress brows are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
that every tongue says beauty should look so

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

how oft when thou my music music playst
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoyd no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowd bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damaskd red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to myself alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on anothers neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgments place
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
and thence this slander as i think proceeds

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
ist not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossd
of him myself and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd
prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

so now i have confessd that he is thine
and i myself am mortgaged to thy will
myself ill forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learnd but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that putst forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
him have i lost thou hast both him and me
he pays the whole and yet am i not free

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
and will to boot and will in overplus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one will

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckond none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy stores account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lovest me for my name is will

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
be anchord in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
and to this false plague are they now transferrd

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutord youth
unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressd
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o loves best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flatterd be

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my oer pressd defense can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since i am near slain
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
only my plague thus far i count my gain
that she that makes me sin awards me pain

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and seald false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbd others beds revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou be denied

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her featherd creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infants discontent
so runnst thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mothers part kiss me be kind
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colourd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turnd fiend
suspect i may but not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in anothers hell
yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

those lips that loves own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate
to me that languishd for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
i hate she alterd with an end
that followd it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
i hate from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying not you

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men
and death once dead theres no more dying then

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
the uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and frantic mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
at random from the truth vainly expressd
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
loves eye is not so true as all mens no
how can it o how can loves eye be true
that is so vexd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against myself with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan
what merit do i in myself respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind
those that can see thou lovest and i am blind

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantize of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross bodys treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a lie

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dians this advantage found
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground
which borrowd from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seething bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress eye loves brand new fired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distemperd guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes

RHYME a b a b c d c d e f e f g g

the little love god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmd
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from loves fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men diseased but i my mistress thrall
came there for cure and this by that i prove
loves fire heats water water cools not love
